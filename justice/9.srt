1
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:12,036
(Episode 17)

2
00:00:22,072 --> 00:00:23,346
It brings back old memories.

3
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:26,987
It has been forever since the three of us got together.

4
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:32,057
Let's talk upstairs.

5
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:35,227
Since when did you come back to Korea?

6
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:38,157
I heard you went to the Philippines after that incident.

7
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:39,667
I don't know.

8
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:42,996
You must have known Chairman Song for quite a long time.

9
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:46,566
I don't know.

10
00:00:48,932 --> 00:00:50,307
Okay, fine.

11
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:52,246
I can get you to answer me later.

12
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,206
Where's Jang Young Mi?

13
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,646
I remember that incident...

14
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:04,257
from time to time...

15
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,951
If you're thinking of playing a trick or running away,

16
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:12,597
you should just give up.

17
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,037
Why did you call me?

18
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,567
Where is Jang Young Mi, you jerk?

19
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:24,106
I changed...

20
00:01:25,572 --> 00:01:26,746
my mind.

21
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:41,356
Did you get him to change his mind?

22
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:43,697
Stop blaming the innocent.

23
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:46,092
Jang Young Mi has nothing to do with this.

24
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:47,167
No.

25
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:49,966
I'm the one who will decide if it has to do with her or not.

26
00:01:52,632 --> 00:01:54,266
Let me ask you one last time.

27
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:55,776
Where is Jang Young Mi?

28
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,627
(Police Station)

29
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:28,167
I'm Prosecutor Han Ju Deok of Criminal Division Three...

30
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:29,806
of Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office.

31
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:32,731
Mr. Cho Hyun Woo, you are under emergency arrest...

32
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:34,231
as a suspect for Cha Eun Bi's murder...

33
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,516
and Jang Young Mi's missing case.

34
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:38,612
Are you with Prosecutor Seo Yeon Ah?

35
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:40,971
Mr. Cho, you have the right to remain silent.

36
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:44,011
Everything you say can be and will be used against you in court.

37
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:45,986
You may also consult an attorney.

38
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,896
Let's go.

39
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:12,116
Was this your plan?

40
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:15,757
You're very quick with these things.

41
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,727
How did you come up with this plan in such a short period of time?

42
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:21,386
This has nothing to do with Jang Young Mi.

43
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:23,296
You need to take your hands off now.

44
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:26,321
Yes, no one is going to care about a nameless actress's...

45
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,027
missing case.

46
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:30,236
But...

47
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:34,231
wouldn't you feel really sorry if no one actually looks for her?

48
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:35,306
Let's be humane.

49
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,657
He's Prosecutor Han Ju Deok of Criminal Division Three.

50
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:32,721
I'll meet with Cho Hyun Woo.

51
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:33,996
Please stall some time.

52
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:35,097
Sure.

53
00:04:37,491 --> 00:04:39,436
(Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office)

54
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:49,671
Why did you arrest Cho Hyun Woo?

55
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:52,642
Him? He's a suspect of the missing case of that actress.

56
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:53,642
Exactly.

57
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:55,587
Since when did you know of that case?

58
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,241
What's the reason of his emergency arrest?

59
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:59,957
Seo Yeon Ah. What are you doing right now?

60
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:02,227
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:04,556
But this is my case.

62
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,892
I can't understand why he arrested him.

63
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,621
You couldn't find Cho Hyun Woo,

64
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,467
and Han Ju Deok did.

65
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:12,731
That's why I told you numerous times...

66
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,332
to make an accurate report.

67
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:15,962
You never made an official report.

68
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:18,277
How can you claim that this is your case?

69
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:20,902
But if by any chance you let him go,

70
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:23,017
he might bring about more victims.

71
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:24,942
Please change the prosecutor in charge to me.

72
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:27,387
If you don't, I will file an official complaint.

73
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:30,911
I heard the information on the recent articles...

74
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:33,356
about Cho Hyun Woo is from you. Is that correct?

75
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:35,926
I should make an official complaint...

76
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:37,957
for leaking information to the media...

77
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:40,727
without reporting it to your superiors, right?

78
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:43,337
Articles?

79
00:05:44,022 --> 00:05:46,366
Did someone leak the information? It wasn't me.

80
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:47,936
Begin your investigation.

81
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:51,637
Bye.

82
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:05,181
- What are you doing? - What's the reason...

83
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,387
for Cho Hyun Woo's emergency arrest?

84
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:10,457
Why should I tell you?

85
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:11,796
Are you my boss?

86
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:14,767
Move aside while I'm still nice.

87
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:18,236
Who gave you an order...

88
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,467
to arrest Cho Hyun Woo?

89
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:23,477
I've been doing this far too long to be ordered around.

90
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:25,806
I'm busy. I have no time.

91
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:27,301
I heard there was a connection...

92
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:28,707
in Hanjoo Hospital's medical malpractice case.

93
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:32,347
Who says so?

94
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:36,917
I heard a lot of bad things about you lately.

95
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:38,316
There are a lot of rumors too.

96
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:40,186
Rumors?

97
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:42,957
It's all nonsense, so don't mind it.

98
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:45,626
But...

99
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:51,092
I think those up there heard some things.

100
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:52,606
Did your father hear anything?

101
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:54,632
What's the rumor?

102
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:55,736
Oh, well...

103
00:06:57,002 --> 00:06:58,676
It's probably all false.

104
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:11,056
Hello, I'm the attorney for Mr. Cho Hyun Woo.

105
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:13,626
Sure.

106
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:34,246
You need to answer me now.

107
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:37,977
Where is Jang Young Mi?

108
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:40,917
Why did you take her?

109
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:46,027
I saw what's in the USB.

110
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:48,056
I know why...

111
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:50,597
Soo Jeong and your brother died.

112
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,097
It's because of the USB, isn't it?

113
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:58,637
My brother and Choi Soo Jeong died seven years ago...

114
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:00,967
because they watched what was in it.

115
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:04,707
And Jang Young Mi watched that too.

116
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:10,816
Did you kill her too?

117
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:17,686
Jang Young Mi?

118
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:20,756
She's not it.

119
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:23,227
Come on, it was the USB.

120
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:27,327
I saw it too.

121
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:35,167
You did? Namwon Restaurant?

122
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:43,647
Then why are you still alive?

123
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:46,046
But since you've seen it,

124
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:50,056
you'll die as well.

125
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:53,757
I'll die?

126
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:59,167
Where's Jang Young Mi?

127
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:08,566
Where is she, you dirtbag?

128
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:17,777
Who is he?

129
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,267
What was his name again? Cho Hyun Woo?

130
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:44,576
He'll be released soon.

131
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,407
I owe you one, sir.

132
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:47,832
Don't say that.

133
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:50,846
And you always pay me back.

134
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:54,846
Every deal has a price.

135
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:57,787
By the way,

136
00:09:58,542 --> 00:10:00,981
is he related to Jang Entertainment's actress?

137
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:04,851
Yes, he's in a pickle right now.

138
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:06,226
Exactly.

139
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:09,162
This isn't a blockbuster.

140
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:11,991
They're saying that those girls from Jang Entertainment...

141
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:13,637
were killed or have disappeared.

142
00:10:13,692 --> 00:10:16,162
It also doesn't make any sense that Bumjung's funds...

143
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,676
have been sent to that agency.

144
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:20,476
What do you mean?

145
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:24,042
Prosecutor Seo seems to be digging into something so ridiculous.

146
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:27,072
I was concerned that such rumors...

147
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:29,257
might get you in trouble.

148
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:37,426
It seems like you want to ask me for something.

149
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:39,596
Well...

150
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:42,226
My car seems a bit too small,

151
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:45,137
and I'm getting sick of the girl.

152
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:49,202
I'm not very happy with my life these days.

153
00:10:49,202 --> 00:10:50,332
The personnel appointment...

154
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:52,037
for the next public prosecutor general will be soon.

155
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:08,857
(Candidates for the Next Public Prosecutor General)

156
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,127
(Candidate Park Min Pyo's Profile)

157
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:15,836
(Candidate Lee Woon Geum's Profile)

158
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:25,806
I'm in a dilemma whether or not...

159
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:29,076
to put your profile in that envelope.

160
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:40,527
Did you meet Cho Hyun Woo?

161
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:43,127
He said Namwon Restaurant was in the USB.

162
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:47,221
Chairman Song and the high-ranking officials...

163
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:48,521
went there.

164
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:50,521
Jang Young Mi was also nearby.

165
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:52,096
Doesn't it seem fishy?

166
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:54,261
You said the table seemed full...

167
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:56,476
but that you only saw Director Do, right?

168
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:57,907
Yes.

169
00:11:58,162 --> 00:12:00,032
Hyun Woo will be released soon.

170
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:02,147
I need to follow him and find out where Young Mi is.

171
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,946
Detective Ma and Mr. Guk are on their way.

172
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:08,716
Where is Cho Hyun Woo?

173
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:11,086
The interrogation was done, so he just left.

174
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:13,357
Darn it!

175
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:37,176
Sir!

176
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:40,586
I lost him. I swear he came this way.

177
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:03,037
Get out of the car, you scumbag! Get out!

178
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,247
You took him, didn't you?

179
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:41,971
Where is he?

180
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:43,702
- I have no idea what you mean. - You little...

181
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:44,917
Where is he?

182
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:06,907
Yes?

183
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,476
Okay.

184
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:13,432
Just in case, check the CCTV footages.

185
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:15,206
If he's on it, please let me know.

186
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:17,247
I doubt he's on it.

187
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:19,887
It was part of their scheme to bring him in and take him out.

188
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:25,487
This is driving me crazy.

189
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,107
You'll be able to reach me whenever.

190
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:49,846
Since you've been formally interrogated,

191
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:52,576
the articles will be taken care of.

192
00:14:52,712 --> 00:14:53,946
It was nice.

193
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:57,917
I got some fresh air.

194
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:00,952
What did Tae Kyung say?

195
00:15:00,952 --> 00:15:03,027
He didn't know anything.

196
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:07,426
He didn't even know why Young Mi disappeared.

197
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:12,296
The dust will settle.

198
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:15,607
It'll be wrapped up soon, so be patient.

199
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:18,237
Oh, right.

200
00:15:19,901 --> 00:15:22,007
He said he opened the USB.

201
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:27,842
The USB?

202
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:30,816
He asked me if that was why his brother died.

203
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:36,257
Will Tae Kyung die as well?

204
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:39,767
After all, he saw Namwon Restaurant.

205
00:15:47,432 --> 00:15:53,407
(Namwon Restaurant)

206
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,542
You did? Namwon Restaurant?

207
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:05,617
(Namwon Restaurant)

208
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:33,618

209
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,176
(Namwon Restaurant)

210
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:16,696
I should take care of that camera.

211
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:42,857
What could've happened in here?

212
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:34,307
Woo Yong, after about 10 years,

213
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:38,377
let's build up a 150-story building in the middle over there.

214
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:39,577
Can you do that?

215
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:41,671
You crazy idiot.

216
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:43,147
Why not? Are you scared?

217
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:46,272
We should remember this day. Let's take a picture.

218
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,087
Stop eating.

219
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:52,756
All right. In 1, 2, 3.

220
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:54,657
Will you show a smile?

221
00:18:57,582 --> 00:18:59,766
He said he opened the USB.

222
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:02,827
He asked me if that was why his brother died.

223
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:06,367
Oh, no! What was that?

224
00:20:08,222 --> 00:20:09,367
A cat. It was a cat.

225
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:19,946
How are you working as a prosecutor when you get scared that easily?

226
00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:22,946
It jumped out of there suddenly.

227
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:32,157
Come on.

228
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:33,926
Wait up for me.

229
00:20:41,752 --> 00:20:44,496
When I came here last time, I heard these houses were vacant.

230
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:48,736
Why did Jang Young Mi come here?

231
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,077
(Untitled)

232
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:03,857
Look at this.

233
00:21:08,552 --> 00:21:10,897
Those are Jang Young Mi's missing diaries.

234
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:19,222
(Did Soo Jeong come to this place too? Who killed her? I'm so scared.)

235
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:21,367
Did Soo Jeong come to this place too?

236
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:23,936
Who killed her?

237
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:26,036
I'm so scared.

238
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:32,302
(Do everything to find Jang Young Mi.)

239
00:21:32,302 --> 00:21:34,072
(Since I can't trust you yet,)

240
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:35,986
(I'll give you the rest of the clues depending how well you do your job.)

241
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:46,226
The number you have reached is not in service.

242
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:49,451
I don't think these are from the culprit.

243
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:50,536
Who could it be?

244
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:54,532
You haven't contacted Jung Hae Jin yet, right?

245
00:21:54,532 --> 00:21:56,236
The girl who came here with Jang Young Mi.

246
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:57,407
Not yet.

247
00:21:58,262 --> 00:22:00,601
I was being careful because of Jang Chi Soo.

248
00:22:00,601 --> 00:22:02,276
I need to meet with her.

249
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,822
Soo Jeong told me...

250
00:22:17,822 --> 00:22:19,966
that she met men in a place where it looked like a maze.

251
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:22,526
She cried all night because she was scared.

252
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:25,067
Did those men kill her?

253
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:28,032
(You'd better send back Jang Young Mi.)

254
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:29,506
(Or these diaries will be disclosed to the public!)

255
00:22:33,302 --> 00:22:35,101
- Who sent these? - It was sent...

256
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:36,206
from a computer at an internet cafe, so I couldn't track it.

257
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:38,746
Anyone from Jang Young Mi's social circle who would do this?

258
00:22:39,812 --> 00:22:41,486
Is it possible Lee Tae Kyung sent these?

259
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:44,512
If Tae Kyung knew about these diaries,

260
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:46,681
he would have done something.

261
00:22:46,681 --> 00:22:48,312
I'll look into her social circle.

262
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:49,686
Find out who sent this. Hurry.

263
00:22:57,762 --> 00:22:59,222
(You'd better send back Jang Young Mi.)

264
00:22:59,222 --> 00:23:01,337
(Or these diaries will be disclosed to the public!)

265
00:23:01,431 --> 00:23:02,732
On July 27...

266
00:23:02,732 --> 00:23:04,536
No, not that case.

267
00:23:05,032 --> 00:23:06,107
Hold on.

268
00:23:07,671 --> 00:23:09,147
I'm here to see Lawyer Lee Tae Kyung.

269
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:10,946
Okay.

270
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:12,647
Hello.

271
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:14,917
Lawyer Lee.

272
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:16,186
Lawyer Lee.

273
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:20,211
We spoke on the phone. My name is Lee Tae Kyung.

274
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:21,387
- Hello. - Take a seat.

275
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:35,966
Just like I said on the phone,

276
00:23:37,302 --> 00:23:39,006
I don't know much about Young Mi.

277
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:43,417
I don't know what you like,

278
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:46,377
so you can drink everything here.

279
00:23:53,512 --> 00:23:56,127
I wasn't very close with Young Mi.

280
00:23:58,982 --> 00:24:00,167
If what you say is true,

281
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:02,966
why did you go there?

282
00:24:10,062 --> 00:24:11,377
Just to have a meal.

283
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:13,137
At which restaurant?

284
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:14,506
I don't remember.

285
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:17,742
You came here at least twice a month.

286
00:24:17,742 --> 00:24:19,176
But you don't remember?

287
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:27,357
Have you been to Namwon Restaurant?

288
00:24:29,111 --> 00:24:30,196
No.

289
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:33,827
You must know Chairman Song from Bumjung Construction though.

290
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:37,222
Not really.

291
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:38,297
I'm sure you do.

292
00:24:38,722 --> 00:24:41,062
You've met him at the place you went to with Jang Young Mi.

293
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,137
No, I have not.

294
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:44,837
Ms. Jung Hae Jin.

295
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:48,572
If we don't find Jang Young Mi quickly,

296
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,216
something might happen to her.

297
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:53,986
I'm sure you know the cases with Choi Soo Jeong...

298
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:55,686
and Cha Eun Bi.

299
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:58,756
I'm worried about Young Mi,

300
00:24:59,141 --> 00:25:00,151
but I really don't know anything.

301
00:25:00,151 --> 00:25:01,512
I don't think that's true.

302
00:25:01,512 --> 00:25:03,426
I think you just don't want to tell me.

303
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:09,867
Call me if you want to talk.

304
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:12,097
I'll compensate you amply.

305
00:25:16,601 --> 00:25:18,476
He does keep his promises.

306
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:01,016
I must survive.

307
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:03,456
I must survive no matter what.

308
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:28,436
Hey.

309
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:36,506
Hey.

310
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:38,516
Hey.

311
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:47,951
Please help! I'm locked up here!

312
00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:50,397
Please help! Is anyone out there?

313
00:27:50,722 --> 00:27:52,097
Please help!

314
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:43,147
Please let me live.

315
00:28:43,842 --> 00:28:47,117
Please spare my life. I... I don't want to die.

316
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:51,417
I'm not going to kill you.

317
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:56,256
Please just let me go.

318
00:28:56,282 --> 00:28:57,782
I won't tell anyone else once I get out.

319
00:28:57,782 --> 00:28:59,996
I'll live quietly until the day I die.

320
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:03,327
If you let me go, I'll do anything you say.

321
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:06,236
So please spare my life.

322
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:08,036
Please.

323
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:19,276
Do you want to get out?

324
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:21,847
Yes.

325
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:25,186
I'll do anything. Anything.

326
00:29:28,012 --> 00:29:29,387
I'm also annoyed...

327
00:29:30,522 --> 00:29:31,956
to be stuck here too.

328
00:29:38,022 --> 00:29:39,196
Where's Cho Hyun Woo?

329
00:29:39,262 --> 00:29:40,861
It has nothing to do with Jang Young Mi.

330
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:43,601
If it has nothing to do with her, why are you covering it up?

331
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:45,401
I just don't want to complicate things.

332
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:46,601
He's the guy who killed my brother!

333
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,032
Why do you keep hiding him away?

334
00:29:48,032 --> 00:29:49,532
Why are you not letting me look for Jang Young Mi?

335
00:29:49,532 --> 00:29:51,641
As you know, Cho Hyun Woo isn't in his right mind.

336
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:53,711
If you rub him the wrong way, everything we did...

337
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:55,286
It should get exposed now.

338
00:29:57,742 --> 00:30:00,587
Shouldn't we expose what exactly happened at this point?

339
00:30:01,381 --> 00:30:03,186
Why did my brother die?

340
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:05,426
Who really killed him?

341
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:12,062
Are you sure you can handle it?

342
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,936
Why? Don't you feel confident?

343
00:30:20,948 --> 00:30:23,227
(Episode 18 will air shortly.)

344
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:29,811
It looks like something complicated happened.

345
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:31,910
Did it go well?

346
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,870
Let me know if you need help.

347
00:30:35,504 --> 00:30:37,340
It's no use crying over spilt milk.

348
00:30:37,864 --> 00:30:40,605
The best I can do is clean it up so it doesn't leave...

349
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,379
a lot of marks.

350
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:44,180
While we're at it,

351
00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:46,689
you should probably close down...

352
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:49,290
Namwon Restaurant.

353
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:50,819
Why?

354
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:53,190
Did Lee Tae Kyung catch on?

355
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,160
You should be careful for a while.

356
00:30:56,484 --> 00:30:58,099
Things aren't looking great...

357
00:30:58,325 --> 00:30:59,929
in many ways.

358
00:31:00,395 --> 00:31:03,040
I have never lived carefully in my life.

359
00:31:04,094 --> 00:31:07,109
You can't live your life only doing what you want to do.

360
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,980
Bumjung became this big thanks to Namwon Restaurant.

361
00:31:13,835 --> 00:31:15,174
Are you sure it'll be okay?

362
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:18,050
Jungjin Group was saved from danger seven years ago...

363
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:21,019
thanks to Namwon Restaurant.

364
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:22,359
Exactly.

365
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:25,359
Why would you close down something that awesome?

366
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:30,130
You just have to get rid of Lee Tae Kyung.

370
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,615
Mr. Nam.

371
00:32:59,615 --> 00:33:01,290
- Yes? - Wait.

372
00:33:03,384 --> 00:33:05,019
Look at these pictures.

373
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:06,829
What? Yes.

374
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:12,369
What about these pictures?

375
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:14,070
What are...

376
00:33:14,455 --> 00:33:15,540
those pictures?

377
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:19,339
You know, pictures related to a case.

378
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:20,970
With which case?

379
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:22,310
Just...

380
00:33:22,865 --> 00:33:24,010
Why do you ask?

381
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:28,919
I think this delivery man is someone that I know.

382
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,419
Mr. Lee's younger brother?

383
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,190
His younger brother?

384
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,359
Father.

385
00:33:42,284 --> 00:33:44,000
Hey, you're late.

386
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:47,130
It's Tae Kyung's younger brother.

387
00:33:47,824 --> 00:33:49,239
That was Tae Ju.

388
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:51,910
What do you mean?

389
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:56,280
Oh, do you remember?

390
00:33:56,805 --> 00:33:59,134
After that happened and my legs...

391
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:00,649
became like this,

392
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:04,380
I told you about a friend of mine who always helped me carry my bag.

393
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,149
That friend who died in an accident.

394
00:34:08,275 --> 00:34:10,359
That was Tae Kyung's younger brother.

395
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:12,560
Did you know?

396
00:34:14,955 --> 00:34:16,359
Well...

397
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:17,859
No.

398
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:28,709
It looks like Tae Ju...

399
00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:31,579
helped me meet Tae Kyung.

400
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:36,149
I was bullied at school,

401
00:34:36,444 --> 00:34:37,920
then this happened to my legs,

402
00:34:40,574 --> 00:34:43,420
so I once had a terrible thought and jumped in front of a car.

403
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:50,899
But Tae Ju jumped in to save me.

404
00:34:53,355 --> 00:34:55,029
I mean, he could have died too.

405
00:34:57,394 --> 00:34:58,469
But...

406
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,579
it looks like Tae Ju didn't die in an accident.

407
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:15,360
Who could have killed him?

408
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:19,329
He was such a good kid.

409
00:36:35,925 --> 00:36:38,300
Did anyone ask you about Jang Young Mi?

410
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,510
Or about going to that place?

411
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,110
No.

412
00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:45,134
Did something happen?

413
00:36:45,134 --> 00:36:47,349
Darn it, this is giving me a headache.

414
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,820
Do you know anything about Jang Young Mi's diary?

415
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:54,789
Young Mi's diary?

416
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:57,519
What about it?

417
00:36:58,754 --> 00:37:01,959
She must've written in her diary about going there.

418
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:04,824
It's too complicated to explain everything,

419
00:37:04,824 --> 00:37:07,329
so inform me immediately if something happens.

420
00:37:07,454 --> 00:37:08,969
Who's looking for it?

421
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:10,870
Her diary.

422
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:12,370
I don't know.

423
00:37:14,894 --> 00:37:16,010
Hey.

424
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,479
Do you really not know anything?

425
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:23,149
You were close with her.

426
00:37:23,204 --> 00:37:25,420
Exactly. So what's with her diary?

427
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,519
What's going on?

428
00:37:28,884 --> 00:37:30,060
Forget it.

429
00:37:31,245 --> 00:37:33,190
Anyway, be careful.

430
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:36,260
Don't run your mouths either.

431
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:39,930
Go.

432
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:53,079
What is it?

433
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:56,420
What happened to the movie audition I attended last time?

434
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,750
The one where I drank with them.

435
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,190
Oh, that?

436
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:04,545
They're having money issues. Be patient.

437
00:38:04,545 --> 00:38:06,454
You were sure that they'd film it.

438
00:38:06,454 --> 00:38:08,899
I am. I really am.

439
00:38:10,024 --> 00:38:12,769
They don't think you're young enough.

440
00:38:14,254 --> 00:38:17,000
If this falls through again, I won't stand still.

441
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:20,964
You know very well what I had to go through.

442
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:22,264
You can't do this to me.

443
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:25,704
I know. That's exactly why I'm doing my best.

444
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:27,050
Let's be patient.

445
00:38:28,074 --> 00:38:29,180
I mean...

446
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,245
Why didn't you accept the sponsor offer?

447
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:35,320
Why are you trying so hard?

448
00:38:35,944 --> 00:38:37,120
Live a more comfortable life.

449
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:41,089
If I'm not cast for that movie, I'll disclose everything.

450
00:38:41,355 --> 00:38:43,360
I'm not going to meet the same fate as Young Mi's.

451
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:52,070
Was it you? Was it?

452
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:54,709
You were the one threatening with her diary, weren't you?

453
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:58,479
Is that what's going on right now?

454
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:31,479
I couldn't sleep.

455
00:39:31,965 --> 00:39:34,674
I thought that perhaps, Young Mi was confined...

456
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:36,044
somewhere in here.

457
00:39:36,044 --> 00:39:37,849
Once you've set your mind on something...

458
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:39,745
You haven't changed at all.

459
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:41,050
Speak for yourself.

460
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:44,219
You're the one who is tenacious.

461
00:39:46,414 --> 00:39:47,629
Except for when it comes to dating.

462
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:53,599
I wonder what happened to her in here.

463
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:22,430
(Smile Cart Bar)

464
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:42,950
I'm sorry.

465
00:40:43,445 --> 00:40:46,290
I could trust neither the police nor the prosecution.

466
00:40:46,615 --> 00:40:48,050
I wanted to test you...

467
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,759
to see if you could truly find her.

468
00:40:51,384 --> 00:40:53,629
That's why I sent you those texts.

469
00:40:53,754 --> 00:40:55,229
So why are you here?

470
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:58,629
She wrote about something that happened here.

471
00:40:59,154 --> 00:41:02,270
I thought maybe she was trapped in here,

472
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:03,640
so I came to find her.

473
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:05,869
Where are her diaries?

474
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:29,530
They're gone.

475
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:31,999
I had them in my bag at all times.

476
00:41:32,654 --> 00:41:34,670
They were in here right before I left.

477
00:42:07,195 --> 00:42:08,369
What are you doing here?

478
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:10,400
What?

479
00:42:11,225 --> 00:42:12,609
I have to go somewhere for work.

480
00:42:12,894 --> 00:42:15,739
The president is looking for you. It must be about Young Mi.

481
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,469
(I keep practicing my line...)

482
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:52,410
You know who sent those texts regarding her diaries?

483
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:54,709
I do.

484
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,020
So why are you here?

485
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:02,560
You're the one who calls me over there.

486
00:43:03,644 --> 00:43:05,089
Your secretary...

487
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:07,829
stopped by the agency.

488
00:43:08,115 --> 00:43:10,200
He needs to find out who did it.

489
00:43:24,764 --> 00:43:26,280
I read them.

490
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:31,820
You cast her as the lead of a web drama.

491
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,020
Will that do?

492
00:43:42,955 --> 00:43:45,099
I'd appreciate a suitable compensation for my silence.

493
00:43:55,764 --> 00:43:57,009
Silence?

494
00:43:59,975 --> 00:44:01,849
That's great. You have quite a capacity.

495
00:44:02,804 --> 00:44:06,520
With that strong ambition of yours, you could do anything.

496
00:44:09,445 --> 00:44:10,619
What do you want?

497
00:44:12,455 --> 00:44:13,790
Success.

498
00:44:18,955 --> 00:44:20,170
I finally found out...

499
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:22,700
what Soo Jeong had to go through.

500
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,540
She had come to this place and met those men.

501
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:28,969
She met them in this eerie and strange room...

502
00:44:29,205 --> 00:44:31,609
at the end of a maze-like alley.

503
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,759
Namwon Restaurant.

504
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:46,959
Wrap it up this instant.

505
00:44:49,424 --> 00:44:51,455
Other than Jang Young Mi and Jung Hae Jin,

506
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,530
who else came here?

507
00:44:53,495 --> 00:44:55,400
Those two were the only ones.

508
00:44:55,524 --> 00:44:57,640
Since they were rookies, they were vulnerable.

509
00:44:58,065 --> 00:45:00,735
The other actresses are too famous to do anything to them.

510
00:45:00,735 --> 00:45:03,839
So on the day she disappeared, she was supposed to come here?

511
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:05,079
Yes.

512
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:08,180
Please find her.

513
00:45:09,004 --> 00:45:10,579
She's a poor girl.

514
00:45:10,705 --> 00:45:12,820
Don't worry. We will.

515
00:45:13,715 --> 00:45:16,920
Do you know the man she had met?

516
00:45:17,684 --> 00:45:19,390
I'm not sure.

517
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:21,654
Did you hear anything about her going to Namwon Restaurant?

518
00:45:21,654 --> 00:45:23,924
No, I didn't.

519
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:26,725
So there's a room in this alley,

520
00:45:26,725 --> 00:45:29,670
and that's where she met a man, correct?

521
00:45:29,995 --> 00:45:31,099
Correct.

522
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,349
At times like this, you need to grab the bull by its horns.

523
00:45:43,745 --> 00:45:44,820
Goodness.

524
00:45:46,115 --> 00:45:49,115
You see, this situation is a bit uncomfortable.

525
00:45:49,115 --> 00:45:51,060
Yes, you're right.

526
00:45:52,115 --> 00:45:53,489
I'll take full responsibility.

527
00:45:54,154 --> 00:45:55,290
Please open it.

528
00:45:55,514 --> 00:45:56,900
You must keep your word.

530
00:46:18,144 --> 00:46:19,450
I think this is it!

531
00:46:50,105 --> 00:46:51,379
Is this it?

532
00:46:54,274 --> 00:46:55,349
Yes.

533
00:46:57,585 --> 00:47:01,959
She wrote that there was a blue hourglass in the room.

534
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:12,459
So this is the place where the sexual favors were exchanged.

535
00:48:13,394 --> 00:48:14,769
Scumbags.

536
00:48:16,825 --> 00:48:18,539
Then, that day, Do Hoon Jae also...

537
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:21,610
I think Namwon Restaurant from the USB means this place.

538
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:25,934
Whatever happened in this room was recorded on that UBS.

539
00:48:25,934 --> 00:48:27,410
The sexual favor video?

540
00:48:30,105 --> 00:48:31,474
They pretended to eat at the restaurant,

541
00:48:31,474 --> 00:48:33,120
but they received sexual favors.

542
00:48:37,444 --> 00:48:38,944
Does this mean the murder of Choi Soo Jeong...

543
00:48:38,944 --> 00:48:40,330
is related to this place too?

544
00:48:42,555 --> 00:48:45,100
But why was your brother murdered?

545
00:48:45,224 --> 00:48:46,694
The package my brother tried...

546
00:48:46,694 --> 00:48:48,600
to deliver to Choi Soo Jeong that day...

547
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:51,400
was that USB.

548
00:48:53,835 --> 00:48:56,209
The USB she gave to Jang Young Mi?

549
00:48:57,605 --> 00:48:58,880
That's why.

550
00:48:59,134 --> 00:49:02,049
Someone accidentally saw the video that was never...

551
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:06,019
to be revealed to the others.

552
00:49:11,484 --> 00:49:12,759
Your brother.

553
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,160
Do you think Chairman Song had him killed?

554
00:49:25,394 --> 00:49:28,910
(Bumjung Construction)

555
00:49:35,575 --> 00:49:37,680
Seo Yeon Ah and Lee Tae Kyung stayed there the whole night.

556
00:49:39,305 --> 00:49:40,390
I'm sorry.

557
00:49:42,474 --> 00:49:43,559
Get out.

558
00:50:00,994 --> 00:50:02,140
Seo Dong Suk.

559
00:50:03,305 --> 00:50:05,539
We must use his card now.

560
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:09,249
("The Very First Father and Daughter Prosecutors")

561
00:50:17,944 --> 00:50:19,930
I'm sorry to have asked to meet with you at the last minute.

562
00:50:22,615 --> 00:50:24,029
What is this about?

563
00:50:24,184 --> 00:50:25,999
What was so urgent to discuss?

564
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:27,999
I had something to discuss with you.

565
00:50:28,494 --> 00:50:29,900
It's about time.

566
00:50:46,144 --> 00:50:47,489
We can meet some other time.

567
00:50:47,515 --> 00:50:49,819
I don't see any reason to have this meeting with him.

568
00:50:53,515 --> 00:50:55,229
I'm quite disappointed.

569
00:50:58,525 --> 00:51:00,370
Have you already forgotten about me?

570
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:09,434
I think today's meeting will be very important...

571
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:11,140
for the sake of your daughter.

572
00:51:24,884 --> 00:51:25,959
Dad.

573
00:51:26,085 --> 00:51:28,285
What were you thinking about so deeply?

574
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:29,630
You didn't even see your own daughter.

575
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:31,255
Where are you coming from?

576
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,330
From the court.

577
00:51:32,525 --> 00:51:34,330
It seems like I have a lot of hard cases.

578
00:51:38,065 --> 00:51:39,200
It's hot.

579
00:51:41,394 --> 00:51:42,809
Do you want to have patbingsu?

580
00:51:43,505 --> 00:51:44,580
Patbingsu?

581
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:46,410
I'd love to.

582
00:51:59,585 --> 00:52:00,729
This is good.

583
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,100
I didn't know we had a place like this near our office.

584
00:52:04,924 --> 00:52:07,729
Your father has been coming here for 20 years.

585
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,600
Please enjoy.

586
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,234
Goodness. You've kept this nice place...

587
00:52:13,234 --> 00:52:15,009
to yourself for two decades.

588
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:17,005
I feel so betrayed.

589
00:52:17,005 --> 00:52:18,140
Isn't work...

590
00:52:19,234 --> 00:52:20,549
tiring?

591
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:23,680
It is tiring.

592
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:25,979
It's so exhausting.

593
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:30,590
I hope you can resign from your job...

594
00:52:31,884 --> 00:52:34,190
and get married now.

595
00:52:34,654 --> 00:52:35,930
No way.

596
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:37,860
Are you serious?

597
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:41,469
You wanted me to become the first female public prosecutor general.

598
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:45,340
Do you want to?

599
00:52:47,065 --> 00:52:48,140
Well,

600
00:52:48,634 --> 00:52:51,404
I might not be a good public prosecutor general like yourself,

601
00:52:51,404 --> 00:52:54,410
but I want to be a prosecutor the people aren't ashamed of.

602
00:52:58,174 --> 00:52:59,850
That will be hard.

603
00:53:00,575 --> 00:53:02,019
I just want you...

604
00:53:02,615 --> 00:53:04,390
to see only beautiful things...

605
00:53:05,184 --> 00:53:06,890
and eat only delicious meals.

606
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:09,930
That's the life I want for you.

607
00:53:15,954 --> 00:53:18,340
Dad, you must be getting old.

608
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:19,840
You're getting old.

609
00:53:56,065 --> 00:53:58,840
(Lee Tae Kyung)

610
00:54:11,444 --> 00:54:12,989
(Do not smoke in the toilet.)

611
00:54:42,714 --> 00:54:43,789
You're here.

612
00:54:46,184 --> 00:54:48,229
This is your favorite restaurant.

613
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:51,860
But why is this restaurant always closed?

614
00:54:52,424 --> 00:54:54,469
They should just close it down if they don't open regularly.

615
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:02,709
Woo Yong.

616
00:55:06,634 --> 00:55:08,509
Do you still have nothing to say to me?

617
00:55:17,144 --> 00:55:18,459
I guess so.

618
00:55:19,884 --> 00:55:21,860
I have nothing to say to you.

619
00:55:25,984 --> 00:55:27,900
And I'm getting tired of lying.

620
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:45,380
Tae Kyung.

621
00:55:46,974 --> 00:55:48,890
Should we just quit everything,

622
00:55:50,285 --> 00:55:52,690
open up a fancy bar,

623
00:55:53,315 --> 00:55:54,390
and...

624
00:55:55,315 --> 00:55:57,759
drink every day like this?

625
00:56:01,255 --> 00:56:03,370
Goodness, you're talking nonsense again.

626
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:07,110
You can't stop now.

627
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:10,680
You ought to go to a higher place, Chairman Song...

628
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:13,549
As you get rid of people who are in your way...

629
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:15,749
and kill people who are bothering you.

630
00:56:16,234 --> 00:56:20,049
You ought to go all the way to the top.

631
00:56:35,194 --> 00:56:37,069
Is that why you killed my brother too?

632
00:56:38,924 --> 00:56:41,509
Because he would stand in your way to the top?

633
00:57:19,204 --> 00:57:20,650
Back then, should I...

634
00:57:22,174 --> 00:57:24,080
have killed you too?

635
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,360
Then we wouldn't have had to face a day like this.

636
00:57:35,214 --> 00:57:36,590
Exactly.

637
00:57:39,724 --> 00:57:41,400
You made a mistake.

638
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:45,069
You should have killed me and finished the case perfectly.

639
00:57:45,394 --> 00:57:48,840
You should have killed my brother and killed me too.

640
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:54,180
Then you would have gone way up high without getting stalled back.

641
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:55,309
Isn't that so?

642
00:58:12,724 --> 00:58:15,269
It was all to cover up something disgusting like that.

643
00:58:16,865 --> 00:58:18,539
Why did you do that to that innocent kid?

644
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:21,265
That poor kid was aching all over...

645
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:24,279
because he was busy making deliveries from the dawn.

646
00:58:26,005 --> 00:58:27,110
Why?

647
00:58:28,674 --> 00:58:30,450
What did he do wrong?

648
00:58:31,805 --> 00:58:32,920
What?

649
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:35,950
What?

650
00:58:37,244 --> 00:58:39,959
Why did you kill him? Why?

651
00:58:42,484 --> 00:58:43,600
Why?

652
00:58:47,954 --> 00:58:49,299
So...

653
00:58:52,494 --> 00:58:54,640
why did you get this far, Tae Kyung?

654
00:58:54,934 --> 00:58:56,410
So why...

655
00:58:58,265 --> 00:59:00,450
did you make me come this far?

656
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:02,479
Why?

657
00:59:03,545 --> 00:59:04,880
Why?

658
01:00:02,595 --> 01:00:03,709
Darn it.

659
01:00:25,654 --> 01:00:27,200
Did you kill Jang Young Mi too?

660
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,029
Just like what you did to my brother?

661
01:00:30,525 --> 01:00:32,365
I'll find her no matter what it takes.

662
01:00:32,365 --> 01:00:36,610
I'll find her and deal with the jerks who did that to them.

663
01:00:37,704 --> 01:00:38,910
You better get ready.

664
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:51,819
Hello.

665
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:27,244
(Justice)

666
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:28,815
Why did you bring me here?

667
01:02:28,815 --> 01:02:29,815
I thought it would be fun.

668
01:02:29,815 --> 01:02:31,515
Who do you think you are? Don't you know who I am?

669
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:32,684
Why did you go to Namwon Restaurant?

670
01:02:32,684 --> 01:02:34,555
- What? - You'll get hurt if you go further.

671
01:02:34,555 --> 01:02:36,355
How can I get even more hurt at this point?

672
01:02:36,355 --> 01:02:38,025
Bring Jang Young Mi here now...

673
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:39,930
unless you want Dae Jin to find out.

674
01:02:39,984 --> 01:02:42,224
I looked into the real owner of Namwon Restaurant.

675
01:02:42,224 --> 01:02:43,224
Long time no see.

676
01:02:43,224 --> 01:02:46,295
It won't be easy to find an answer to this case. You should stop.

677
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:48,494
Young Mi is still alive, isn't she?

678
01:02:48,494 --> 01:02:50,305
Please find her.

679
01:02:50,305 --> 01:02:52,434
So who's the one that filmed the sex video here?

680
01:02:52,434 --> 01:02:54,505
Where is that USB?

681
01:02:54,505 --> 01:02:57,350
The music box. I think I know where the USB is.
