<i>Episode 21</i>

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,090
What brings you here—?

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,290
Jin Eon needs you right now, Dokgo Yong Gi.

4
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,270
Pardon?

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,010
This was found amongst Hae Gang's possessions.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
<i>Shin Yang Bank - Check Card
Dokgo Yong Gi</i>

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,790
On the day of Hae Gang's accident, it appears that you were with her, Dokgo Yong Gi.

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,590
What did you say?

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,910
If we want to find out how and why Hae Gang died,
then we definitely need your help.

10
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,810
Please help Jin Eon.

11
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
the Forgotten Love Team at Viki</i>

12
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,650
What! The urn is gone?

13
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,990
In order to work at daybreak, I sent someone to do a preliminary check but it was completely empty.

14
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>Wh-What could have happened?</i>

15
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,000
<i>Just be alive.</i>

16
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,700
Just please be alive, Do Hae Gang!

17
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,880
Hae Gang isn't here.

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,280
Excuse me?

19
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,340
There's no way—you're saying that it's empty?

20
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,360
Where could my wife be right now?

21
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,260
Could you please take a look at this picture of my wife?

22
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,100
No. I don't want to see it.

23
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,160
Where I'm at right now with my feelings, I don't think I can bring myself to look at your late wife.

24
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,540
She's alive.

25
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,120
Like you.

26
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,660
But... Why hasn't she appeared? And for four years?

27
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,520
I suppose she's lost her memory, too—like you.

28
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,780
I came because I was told that

29
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,180
I was with your wife on the day of the accident.

30
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:49,660
Because my card wallet was found with Hae Gang's possessions.

31
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,800
<i>I'll help you.</i>

32
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,500
I'm scared, but I also want to know

33
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,800
the reason why I was with your wife that day.

34
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,840
This is why he left it empty.

35
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,860
So that Brother-in-law could find it,

36
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,190
so that he can strangle me any time.

37
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,300
That's why he said you couldn't put someone else's remains in there.

38
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,810
An urn with Lawyer Do's name written on it can't ever be filled with a stranger's ashes.

39
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,730
That's why that old geezer was being so stubborn about it!

40
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,460
I didn't know his intention but I thought it's his affection for Lawyer Do.

41
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,620
That sneaky bastard.

42
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,740
You said it was a suicide, but the urn is empty.

43
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,650
How should we block this?

44
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:59,340
Just come up with a witness for the suicide. Since there's no evidence, all that's needed is a witness.

45
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,550
There's only suspicion but no evidence. Don't you think?

46
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,540
There's no record of the accident, no videos, absolutely nothing. How are they going to prove anything.

47
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:17,100
Unless Do Hae Gang comes back alive, unless Dokgo Yong Gi's memory returns,

48
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,330
it will be impossible to track.

49
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,580
What if he asks why there isn't any record of the accident, when there was even a witness?

50
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,400
The record was removed.

51
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,100
To protect Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals, the Chairman covered up his daughter-in-law's suicide.

52
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,700
<i>It's okay.</i>

53
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,070
There's nothing to block, and we can block it.

54
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,780
It's up to Jin Eon to prove it, not me.

55
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,920
We just need to get rid of Dokgo Yong Gi.

56
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,460
As long as that woman, Dokgo Yong Gi, is gone...

57
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,600
<i>On September 27, 2011,</i>

58
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,300
it's showing that I scrapped my car.

59
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,080
That's the very next day after you were scheduled to go to China.

60
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,750
Then, the accident was the day before.

61
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,550
Do Hae Gang's rental car was returned just fine,

62
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:16,540
but my car was scrapped, and my card wallet was with Do Hae Gang's possessions.

63
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,200
How in the world are we going to figure this out?

64
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,320
If there's a possibility...

65
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,920
If there's a chance I'm your wife...

66
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,130
I'll make sure to find out and prove that's not the case.

67
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,770
I'll make sure to find out what happened and by whom, so until then,

68
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,360
please wait.

69
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,800
There is something called an Accident Verification Certificate.

70
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,950
If you get one, you can check more details of the accident under my name.

71
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,240
I'll check tomorrow.

72
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,260
I'll try—to remember.

73
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,800
I'll try my best to get my memory back.

74
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,880
It seems that's the way we can end this.

75
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:41,970
It seems that's the way I'll be able to end it with you.

76
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,700
<i>Who is this?</i>

77
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,120
Aren't you Dokgo Yong Gi?

78
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,220
What brings you to President Choi's office at this hour?

79
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,720
Is he inside?

80
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,300
Yes.

81
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,830
It seems like you're on your way out, so why don't we head out together?

82
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,380
Yes, okay.

83
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,530
Did you bring your car?

84
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,470
No.

85
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,700
Then we can take you to where you need to go.

86
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,870
No, thank you. I'll just take the bus.

87
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,400
Why don't you just ride in my car? I have something to say to you, Dokgo Yong Gi.

88
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,840
Excuse me? Something to say?

89
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,580
You're working hard this late at night.

90
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,400
Yeah. You too, Brother-in-law.

91
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,920
So it's understood? No more picketing until Moon Tae Joon recovers.

92
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,700
Yes.

93
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,080
And once he regains consciousness, it's agreed that the lawsuit will be dropped.

94
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,320
You heard from his family, right?

95
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,120
Yes.

96
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,420
Brother-in-law, I received Dokgo Yong Gi's promise that she'll let go of the Pudoxin lawsuit.

97
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,960
Is that right?

98
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:04,040
Thorough epidemiologic investigation and debunking false charges are promises I received from Choi Jin Eon.

99
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,940
Why don't you leave Pudoxin up to me from now on?

100
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,300
Both of you, Brother-in-law and Dokgo Yong Gi.

101
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,380
I'll handle it. I'll take care of it myself.

102
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Okay. Let's do that.

103
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,360
This is the first floor, you can get off.

- Ah, yes.

120
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,320
I don't have a change—only a ₩10,000 ($10) bill.

121
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,060
Ay, you don't have any change? Hurry up and put it in.

He said it might get too stuffy for her, so he wanted to move her to a place that was sunny and breezy,

142
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,370
so I agreed to it.

143
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,340

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,040
How did you know?

147
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,590
Pardon? Ah, I was working and suddenly

148
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:13,530
Director Do came to mind, so I stopped by and was surprised to find it was completely empty.

149
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:18,250
I am filled with gratitude as it could be difficult for you.

150
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,510
Did Brother-in-law say anything in particular?

151
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,010

Surprised, who's surprised? Man, it's because I'm glad to see you.

156
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,220
Aigoo ya! I didn't come to see you, so you can stop frowning.

157
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,210
That's a relief. I'm back now.

158
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,880
Yeah, okay. Sit down, Professor Min. Should I get you some tea?

159
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,800
No, thank you. I came to get some water.
Please continue with your conversation.

160
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,060
See you later.

161
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,550

Aigoo, seriously, who's going to take that guy.

<i> Why? Besides being a bit mean, he doesn't have any faults.</i>

Everyone has their other half. Just wait, she'll appear.

169
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,760
I see.

170
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,580
Professor Min, I heard that you're so renowned that patients come from abroad to see you.

171
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,520
They struggled to come here from such a long distance,
so you should take extra special care of them,

172
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,090
and make sure they get better, in a kind manner, okay?

173
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,090
I know how to take care of my own patients. Please stop worrying.

174
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,100
You're not cold?

175
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,050
And if I'm cold, what?

176
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,990
Then you have to run.

177
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,780
Should we run? You look cold.

178
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,200
You tend to get cold easily, but you're not sensitive to the heat, right?

179
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,190
No.

180
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,560
That's not the case.

181
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,930
Who were you thinking I was when you followed me here?

182
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:34,780
I was thinking it'd be nice if Dokgo Yong Gi was my wife. If you were my wife, Yong Gi.

183
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,940
Because when I see you, I feel nervous.

184
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,260
Because when I look into your eyes, I feel pain.

185
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,120
At one point in time, this charcoal was

186
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,090
once a tree branch laced with white snow.

187
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,950
Such a beautiful saying...

188
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,200
I guess it's not just anyone who can be a poet.

189
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:24,440
When she was young, even the spot where a flea had bitten her was beautiful.

190
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,280
This is my story. This is my story to a T.

191
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:58,910
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
the Forgotten Love Team at Viki</i>

192
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,570
Hello?

193
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,230
<i>Yes, Mother, it's me.</i>

194
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,680
Did you get some sleep?

195
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,460
<i>Of course.</i>

196
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,130
Please go with me to the hospital today.

197
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,230
Mother, you definitely have to go.

198
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,270
<i>The medicine for it is under the way being developed.</i>

199
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:29,080
<i> Sunbae was also researching Dementia.
If you get diagnosed it early,</i>

200
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,610
<i>You have to be taking good care of yourself to be able to take the medication that Sunbae is developing.</i>

201
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,060
Okay. Okay, let's go.

202
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:47,490
Let's go and receive testing to see if I have it or not.

203
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,590
Yes. Yes, Mother.

204
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,310
No, it's fine. I'll go get ready and then I'll come by to pick you up.

205
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,020
Okay. I'm hanging up now.

206
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,030
Do you know anything about Han Gang Group's youngest daughter?

207
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,290
Why?

208
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:12,250
I try to make my brother-in-law and her a couple.

209
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:14,260
Her family is probably the 20th wealth among Chaebols?

210
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,110
You think you can control a person's fate, that if you stick people together or pull them apart, it ends up how you want?

211
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:23,870
Just let him date a woman he likes so he doesn't get old and regret it.

212
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,830
Where is there a marriage that a person doesn't regret when they get old?

213
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,520
One way or another, there's regret. One way or another, it ends up broken.

214
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,800
If that's going to happen, then you might as well look at wealth, family, and education.

215
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,780
That way you end up having much less regret when you get older.

216
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:43,130
Please find out for me, since that side has shown interest in my brother-in-law.

217
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,500
Okay.

218
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,240
And make sure to check whether she is doing drugs or not. That's the scariest.

219
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,080
Our Jin Eon needs to hurry up and get married too.

220
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,890
I need to at least see that. I need to at least see our Jin Eon get married.

221
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,600
See it and then what?

222
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:09,880
Why'd you stop in the middle of talking? It's making my imagination run wild.

223
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,430
I wonder what that secret is that you can't say out loud.

224
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,530
Oh, yeah. I heard Do Hae Gang's imitation has amnesia.

225
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,170
What? Amnesia?

226
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,300
Yes. I heard she lost her entire memory.

227
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,350
- How?
- I don't know how.

228
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
I thought maybe her liver had fallen out of her insides,
(due to being so swollen; "swollen liver" = to be overly bold/shameless)

229
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,800
but it was her memory that had fallen out of her brain.

230
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,610
I wonder what it would feel like to have your memory disappear.

231
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:49,360
I wonder what it would feel like to live without being able to remember anything.

232
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,740
Well, I guess your thoughts of revenge would disappear, your anger would go away,

233
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:00,090
and so would any hatred and resentment,

234
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,600
I suppose you'd live peacefully, with a kind and loving heart.

235
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,030
Why?

236
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,140
You're the one who needs to have amnesia. You're the one who needs to lose her memory, seriously.

237
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,190
What did you say?

238
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,420
It'd be nice to deposit memories into a bank.

239
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,230
If my memories were deposited into a savings account,

240
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:29,650
then it'd be nice to just be able to withdraw and use them whenever I needed.

241
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,920
I have a long way to go if I want to follow in your footsteps, Father-in-law.

242
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,940
I couldn't foresee a second ahead of time like a fool so I believed and thought you were my side.

243
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:58,260
I felt guilty and sorry without knowing you sit there and think only about getting rid of me everyday.

244
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:04,980
I don't know about anyone else, but I suppose you'd be the one to know about the anxiety I'm feeling that's driving me crazy...

245
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:13,150
I was foolish. I guess I've always been a bit foolish.

246
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:19,620
I understand. Yes, I get it now, Father-in-law. Now that I've completely grasped your true intention,

247
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:24,150
it's war from now on, Father-in-law.

248
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,060
If you wave a knife at me, then I'll shoot you with a gun.

249
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:35,270
But rather than it hitting you, I think it'll be your son, who's cluelessly running wild, ending up taking the bullet—

250
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,950
That's my worry.

251
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:43,600
Don't worry. Because my son can just shoot you first.

252
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,780
Because, even if I forgive you, that guy will never be able to forgive you.

253
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,340
I may not be able to punish you, but that guy,

254
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:59,030
when it comes to him, he can definitely punish you.

255
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,830
You talk as if I'm the one who's done something wrong.

256
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,400
There is a difference.

257
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,600
The statute of limitations has expired for me. But it hasn't expired for you.

258
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,020
I may not have a lot of time left to live, but you

259
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,790
have many years ahead of you.

260
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,110
Let's have breakfast together, Brother-in-law.

261
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,860
- I don't really feel like it today.
- Then come sit for a little while before you leave.

262
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,690
Alright, I guess.

263
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:48,290
Whenever it's possible, let's all make sure to have breakfast together.

264
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:54,470
It's my wish, so everyone please stick to it. Choi Jin Eon, especially you.

265
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,440
Okay.

266
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,100
Are you doing better now?

267
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,400
Yes.

268
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,900
You see, because in Hae Gang's urn—Hae Gang isn't there.

269
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,500
Wh-What did you say?

270
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,590
What isn't there?

271
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,720
That's absurd! How can you say something so outrageous!

272
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,540
You mean there aren't any remains? Why is it? How can there not be any?

273
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:22,190
I guess Brother-in-law would know that. Why is Hae Gang's urn empty?

274
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,520
We never ended up finding her body.

275
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:37,040
If you never found a body, but you confirmed her death,

276
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,030
I suppose there's a witness who's able to provide even more guarantee than Hae Gang's own body.

277
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,370
Someone who was there with Hae Gang at the scene.

278
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,500
That's right. There's a witness who saw her fall into the dam.

279
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,530
And Father-in-law is the one who had the police report removed.

280
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,960
<i>Since we can't let the whole world know about his daughter-in-law's suicide.</i>

281
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,910
I saw Hae Gang yesterday. A Hae Gang who's very much alive.

282
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,290
What'd you say? She's alive?

283
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,570
I'm sure you saw it wrong. Attorney Do is dead.

284
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,650
Last time, you confused another person for Attorney Do too, remember?

285
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:13,410
I suppose. Whether I'm confused,

286
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:17,710
or whether Hae Gang is still alive. I'll check and find out.

287
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,880
I thought—

288
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,550
Jin Eon. Jin Eon! Pull yourself together.

289
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:31,160
<i>That's a disease. I'm telling you, it's not love, but a mental disease!</i>

290
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,640
All this really is, is that everyone looks like Do Hae Gang to you right now.

291
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,750
<i> I understand. The pain of losing your spouse.</i>

292
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,120
You just don't want to admit it. You want to deny it.

293
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,260
But your the one who abandoned her. You were the one who asked Father to get rid of her.

294
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,960
Omo, hey, hey!

295
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,670
Just stay still, please.

296
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,500
Whether it was suicide or not, whether there are remains or not, however she died,

297
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,270
you're the one who made it end up like this.

298
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:02,040
I'm saying this all happened because of you. Even if your wife came back alive,

299
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,030
with her personality, she would never forgive you.

300
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,830
Only you miss her to death, Do Hae Gang hates you to death.

301
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:14,410
<i>If she saw you, she'd want to take revenge on you.
How could you expect her to love you?</i>

302
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,660
It's your sin. The original sin you started. It's the seed you sowed.

303
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,840
<i>This is all a punishment. So quit obsessing over Do Hae Gang, and just receive your punishment, okay?</i>

304
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,040
When you planted hatred, how can you expect to sprout love?

305
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:42,810
What is this like salted vegetables? Head up and look at me.

306
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:51,460
<i>Whenever you eat or you fight, you need to look at each other and do it.</i>

307
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,800
<i>I'm telling to you guys to look at each other, instead of looking away from each other.</i>

308
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,000
<i>If you keep turning away from each other during tough times, </i>

309
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,800
<i>when the time comes that you want to look to each other, you won't be able to anymore. It'll be too late.</i>

310
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,990
Did you get disappointed by Yong Gi?

311
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,310
<i>It's a given for family to disappoint each other.</i>

312
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:13,330
One minute it's disappointment, the next it's hope, then desire.

313
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,330
That's family.

314
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:22,010
Don't hold a grudge but believe each other and speak out honestly when you fight.

315
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:27,760
If you hold a grudge and not speak out, you will really get narrow-minded.

316
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,320
People's hearts, too.

317
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,310
She's not family, yet.

318
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,590
Don't trap Yong Gi by calling her family, Father.

319
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,560
You were always honest.

320
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,360
You always looked directly into my eyes and told me honestly.

321
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,410
The one who can't do it is me.

322
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:09,690
<i>I'm in the middle of thinking things through and agonizing over them.</i>

323
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,710
Just give me a little more time. Then,

324
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,680
I will look at your eyes and honestly fight with you.

325
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:36,730
Mom. Am I getting a shot today?

326
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,220
Today, just an exam.

327
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,620
Should we play that?

328
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,380
Ms. Zhang Ming!

329
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,870
Oh yes, I'm right here, Zhang Ming.

330
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,440
- Please come in.
- Yes.

331
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,950
Let's go in, Woo Joo.

332
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,080
This way, please.

333
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:07,380
Come on, let's sit you down. Thank you.

334
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,890
Aren't you going to greet the doctor?

335
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,170
Ni hao! ("Hello!" in Chinese)

336
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,380
Welcome, Dokgo Woo Joo.

337
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:22,010
I already told you her name isn't Dokgo Woo Joo,
so why do you keep—

338
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,560
I'll sit down.

339
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:32,420
Why don't you start by telling me her symptoms—in Korean.

340
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,510
Pardon?

341
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,450
Ah, that's—

342
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,820
My child was falling down all the time, so I took her to the local hospital— <i>(spoken in dialect)</i>

343
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,420
- <i> Next patient.</i>
- Excuse me?

344
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,820
What are you doing? See these people out, and bring in the next patients.

345
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,020
The relationship between the doctor and the patient starts with respect.

346
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,720
If the basics are wrong, rarities can't be cured.

347
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,370
Korean—

348
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,680
I can just speak Korean, then.

349
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,400
Okay, then. Please tell me Woo Joo's symptoms.

350
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,750
She falls down easily and has anemia.

351
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,620
She was being treated for leukemia but it didn't seem right.

352
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,730
Strange cells were seen in her bone marrow.

353
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,180
Looked like it may be Gaucher's disease.

354
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:25,110
Since you are the expert in this field, I came to Korea because of you.

355
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,270
Let's have a basic examination and an enzyme analysis right away.

356
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,510
It's difficult to determine by bone marrow tests alone.

357
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,300
Gaucher cells are not always found in the bone marrow.

358
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:38,470
Since there are many similar cells, though it may be more costly, you must get an enzyme analysis.

359
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,920
<i>Hong Se Hee!</i>

360
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,800
You're so pretty. What's your name?

361
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,740
Zhang Ling.

362
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,750
Zhang Ling? You must have come from China, is that right?

363
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:45,620
What's the matter? Is there something on my face?

364
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,810
<i>Dokgo Yong Gi.</i>

365
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,740
I swear, really!

366
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,480
Passport.

367
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,200
Instead, please pay me back 57,520 won.

368
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,360
Are you not going to pay me?

369
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,320
I'm going to find some work today, okay?

370
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,820
I'm planning to do whatever work comes my way as soon as I can, without being picky whatsoever, so

371
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,280
please just give me a few days.

372
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,240
I'll give you three days. In three days,

373
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,610
by 2:47pm, please pay me back by then.

374
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,630
Fine.

375
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,580
Your name is Dokgo Yong Gi?

376
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,090
Pardon?

377
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,010
No, it's not! The doctor got it wrong.

378
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,230
My name is Zhang Ming! Zhang Ming.

379
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,650
But—why are you staring at me like that?

380
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,490
I've never seen you before.

381
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,200
<i>Female Plaintiff in Lawsuit for Damages from Medication Side Effects, Jumps Off Court Building</i>

382
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,370
<i>That woman is on a different level from Yong Gi Unni.</i>

383
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:53,030
<i>She's cold-hearted and cruel.</i>

384
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:02,500
<i>Pharmaceutical Chemist Loses Patent Infringement Lawsuit, Murders Opposing Attorney's Daughter in Retaliation</i>

385
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,680
<i>Her daughter died.</i>

386
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,930
<i> Because of his wife.</i>

387

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by

388
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,200
<i>Accident Verification Certificate
Name: Dokgo Yong Gi, Accident Date/Time: 8-3-2011 2:10 pm, Accident Location: City of Guri, Degree of Accident: Injury</i>

389
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,600
<i>...victim suffered threat with a deadly weapon and attempted kidnapping by an unidentified assailant.</i>

390
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,100
8-14-2011...in Cheon Nyeon underground parking lot, victim suffered threat with a deadly weapon and attempted kidnapping by suspect Lee Jung Man.

391
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,900
<i>It pops up as an assault.</i>

392
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,550
Since a deadly weapon was used, even if it was attempted, an aggravated assault charge should have been issued.

393
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,800
<i>Special robbery is a crime that shall be punished by imprison at least five years.</i>

394
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,440
How can the culprit who was apprehended red-handed

395
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,860
be free of all charges?

396
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,740
<i>I wouldn't know. Why don't you ask the prosecutor that was in charge then?</i>

397
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,720
<i>Why are you acting like this now?</i>

398
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,990
<i>Let go of the past and stay careful.</i>

399
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,860
<i>And the same incident two separate times!</i>

400
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,460
<i>And please don't take revenge.</i>

401
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,500
What was the date, the day you found Dokgo Yong Gi?

402
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,350
September 26, 2011.

403
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,430
I did a search on the car.

404
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,200
On September 27, it's listed that Dokgo Yong Gi

405
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,480
went in person to go scrap her car.

406
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,610
She was in the hospital, until the 28th.

407
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,900
Hae Gang's urn is empty.

408
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,420
She's alive. I'm going to find her.

409
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,330
This time, properly, without fail, for sure,

410
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,360
<i>I'm going to find Hae Gang.</i>

411
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,530
I'm still certain that Dokgo Yong Gi

412
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,120
is my wife.

413
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,390
I will find out for sure and then act accordingly.

414
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,090
I can't afford to just believe what you tell me,

415
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,430
and then lose her while she's right in front of me.

416
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,240
This one woman.

417
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,870
The woman who you and I both love.

418
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:20,480
Let's just focus on that woman, and go from there.

419
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,830
Let's throw away our greed, let's throw away our regret.

420
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,800
Let's both just focus on her happiness,

421
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,690
and go from there.

422
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,540
Chun Nyeon Pharmaceuticals broke all the rules. What are you going to tell her?

423
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,060
Fake urn, fake columbarium, questionable accident.

424
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,010
I'm telling you your family did that, Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals did that.

425
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,620
Are you going to tell her the truth?

426
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,050
Once you find her and bring her back,

427
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,690
when her memory returns, what are you going to do?

428
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,180
When she remembers you, when she remembers everything,

429
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,680
when that time comes, what is that woman supposed to do?

430
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,880
Have you thought about the shock that she'll experience?

431
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,840
Choi Jin Eon, this time too,

432
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,480
you won't be able to find your wife properly.

433
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,360
And you shouldn't look for her either.

434
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,240
Can you please excuse me?

435
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,960
Hello?

436
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,010
<i>Hello? It's me, Dokgo Yong Gi!</i>

437
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,310
Don't hang up, just give me a minute.

438
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,150
I'll be back after I take this call.

439
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,950
2970.

440
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,610
Did you write it down?

441
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,470
Read it back to me, starting with the address here.

442
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,290
It's not 46. It's 465.

443
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:32,390
You're probably going to get a call.

444
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:35,330
Sorry. I really have to work,

445
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:39,020
You are the only one I can ask as my reference.

446
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,530
What kind of work are you planning to do?

447
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,320
I'll just do whatever job the staffing agency can find.

448
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,320
I don't have a lot of options.

449
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,580
<i>I'll come by after I get off of work. Maybe we can have dinner. I'll see you later.</i>

450
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,540
Ah, hey! You don't have to come.

451
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,750
Seok, I'm really okay.

452
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,500
I even lived in China. This is nothing.

453
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:06,060
I feel so strange.

454
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:13,350
I feel like I came out from my own coffin, not the MRI Machine.

455
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:19,290
I'm not very good at offering words of comfort, Mother.

456
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,890
I don't think I can bear to tell you to have strength either.

457
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:25,210
Nor do I have anything particular to say.

458
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,680
Instead, I'll come with you to the hospital.

459
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,730
Without Jin Eon being involved, if that's what you want.

460
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:37,600
So that you don't have to feel scared or lonely, all by yourself.

461
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,880
Thank you. More than any words of comfort,

462
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,120
that gives me strength and comforts me.

463
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,010
Do you want to go watch a movie?

464
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:58,380
I want to be alone. I want to go alone, just today.

465
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:03,230
That's right. I'll just be by myself for now.

466
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,970
That's just how I'm feeling.

467
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,240
Yes, okay.

468
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,280
I'll be leaving first, then.

469
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,030
Okay.

470
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,640
Okay, then. See you later.

471
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,910
Let's go.

472
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,170
It'll be dangerous if we leave her like this.

473
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:59,620
As long as she's living as Dokgo Yong Gi, she's at risk of falling into danger again.

474
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,230
I came here to ask that you pay attention to her safety.

475
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:09,220
I'll look after Yong Gi, you just look after Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals.

476
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,520
<i>I'm not just saying to be careful, I'm asking you to stop them.</i>

477
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,500
So that they don't do anything, to stop them from doing the same thing twice.

478
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,050
Your family, your people, I'm telling you to stop them.

479
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:23,460
Stealing a person's life, stepping on and twisting their life...

480
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,910
I have no idea what in the world they're trying to hide to keep doing such filthy things,

481
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,580
I will reveal it, end it, clean it up, fight it,

482
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,890
and I will not forgive it.

483
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:41,560
The most immediate work is housekeeping, but you probably won't want to do that because you're young, right?

484
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,570
I'll do it! Housekeeping? I'll do it.

485
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:47,810
Then you should get a phone as soon as possible.

486
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:53,880
I can have you working right away today,
but it's more difficult to contact you.

487
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,570
Then I'll be back in 2 hours.

488
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:01,740
You can't give work to someone else. Okay, Head Manager?

489
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:07,650
I heard about your tough circumstances. I understand so come back in 2 hours.

490
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,670
Thank you! Thank you so much!

491
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:34,940
<i>Employment Agency</i>

492
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:43,900
What brings you—? You don't seem like someone who would need to come here.

493
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:51,080
The lady who just left, her Chinese name in Zhang Ming,
what kind of work did she come here to find?

494
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,090
Do you know her?

495
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,420
I just met her a little while ago at the hospital.

496
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:03,860
Because I feel bad for her being in such a tough situation.
I want to help her, with her kid being sick and all.

497
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:08,720
She got robbed and lost all her money.

498
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,790
She asked for the most immediate work available, so I'm planning to connect her to some housekeeping work.

499
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:17,240
Then, please direct her to my place.

500
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,380
Oh my, would you like to do that?

501
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,880
Yes.

502
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,110
Then, please fill this out.

504
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,230
Here you go.

505
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:57,200
I gathered everything from her vanity, desk, and bathroom, so look through them.

506
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,260
I couldn't bring myself to throw anything away,
not even an eraser.

507
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:07,270
But what are you looking for?

508
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:11,110
I'll tell you later when I'm certain.

509
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,100
I'm the housekeeper who's been sent here by Manager Lee—

510
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,400
<i>Huh?</i>

511
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,900
At the hospital earlier—right?

512
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:33,330
Yes, please come in. Zhang Ling, let's go sit down.

513
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,740
Please have a seat.

514
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,530
Okay.

515
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:52,300
I'm Baek Seok Oppa's younger sister.

516
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,750
Yong Gi Unni.

517
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,780
Pardon?

518
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,450
I saw your face in my brother's middle school graduation album.

519
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,880
That's why at the hospital earlier...

520
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,810
Ay, and I thought—!

521
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,040
Nice to meet you, Yong Gi Unni.

522
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:21,400
My car was scrapped, I'm alive, that woman is dead,

523
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,700
something of mine was found amongst that woman's possessions...

524
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:34,470
Choi Jin Eon's wife, what if I was the one who was responsible for it?

525
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:38,520
It wasn't you. You didn't do it.

526
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:45,160
Didn't you say there was no body found? But that family,
with a fake urn and a fake columbarium...

527
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,510
It's something Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals did,
I'm sure of it. Believe me.

528
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,640
I was a whistleblower,

529
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,950
I almost died twice and the culprit was let go.

530
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:02,630
then, while trying to kill me...

531
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,630
Do you think that might've been what happened, Seok?

532
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:12,190
Both of us look alike, enough to confuse Choi Jin Eon!
They tried to kill me, but

533
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:15,470
they ended up killing Choi Jin Eon's wife instead.

534
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,960
You know, that woman,

535
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,440
would she be able to cope with all of this?

536
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,290
Just like he said, if she's alive,

537
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:38,300
if she returns, would she be able to cope with all of this?

538
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,860
Her in-laws and her husband who did all of this to her,

539
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,340
would she be able to forgive them?

540
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:54,100
If you were that woman,

541
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:57,640
would you be able to forgive them?

542
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:05,140
I think it would be difficult for me.

543
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:11,110
I don't think I could forgive. It's not a matter where I can just forgive,

544
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:13,690
and how could that be forgiven?

545
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,710
That woman will probably not forgive either,

546
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:22,590
if she finds out that Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals,
where she devoted her life, did that to her.

547
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,780
Please check to see if it's the same person.

548
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:38,470
How would you like to receive the results, by email, mail, or fax?

549
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,970
Through fax.

550
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,610
Alright.

551
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:50,890
8am to 12pm, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. How does that sound?

552
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:55,930
Three times? It doesn't even look like there'd be much to clean.

553
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,710
You're doing this on purpose to help me out, aren't you?

554
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:02,940
Don't be like that, there's no need. I can just work multiple jobs.

555
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,630
Manager told me she'd connect me to five or six more places.

556
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:13,240
What was my brother like in middle school?

557
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,940
<i>What was my brother like in middle school?</i>

558
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:21,160
<i>Did you two really date each other? Or did my brother just like to think of it as that?</i>

559
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:27,320
We really did date each other, from 9th to 12th grade.

560
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:32,480
During class he would always read fiction or poetry.

561
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,960
Your brother's nickname was "ground beetle".

562
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,620
That's also the name for "bookworm".

563
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:45,010
It's the perfect name for your brother, right? I still can't kill ground beetles because of your brother.

564

566
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:01,010
Not everyone can be a doctor or lawyer, but you can be a magician.

567
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:05,620
If you open your heart, magic is everywhere.

568
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:11,050
<i>The spells I memorized then have helped me out greatly, when life was hard.</i>

569
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:16,140
<i> If I didn't meet your brother, I would've lived not even knowing I was Dokgo Yong Gi.</i>

570
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:21,600
<i>Ah, and in 12th grade, we watched "Before Sunrise" and got the feels, so your Oppa played Ethan Hawke and I played Julie Delpy,</i>

571
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,600
and we acted out those scenes taking the train to Jeongdongjin.

572
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,230
<i>But you know, I noticed that Julie Delpy's aged a lot since.</i>

573
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,520
<i>Oh my, are you crying?</i>

574
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,890

but I also hate you too.

I'm scared of you. The way you eat away at me...

587
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,620
You are still...destroying me.

588
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:49,810
Why again? Why are you doing this again?

589
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,990
You're the one who started it first.

590
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:56,660

<i>You act like you're the absolute, you act like you're so perfect.</i>

592
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:04,860
You stepped on my heart and tried to get rid of me.

593
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:12,080
I want you to disappear from this world the most.

594
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,860
I really wish you could disappear!

595
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,380
I wish you were dead!

596
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,740
She's still at the office.

597

598
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,260
Yes. Gi Moon is watching her.

What about Moon Tae Joon?

600
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:41,420
No one else has tried to access him besides his family,
and there aren't any unusual signs as of yet.

00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,820

608
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,060

609
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,640
Okay.

610
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,390
At the Wonjoo rest area,

611
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:39,100
I gave it to this woman, along with my cell phone.

612
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:44,460
<i>You see, I took that woman's car and escaped.</i>

613
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:50,560
I kept speeding and driving like crazy, and I finally lost the guy who was trying to kill me.

614
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:55,200
I kept calling her with my cell phone so I could return her car back, but she never picked up.

615
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,320
So I went back to the rest area,

616
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,960
that woman was gone, and my car was gone, too.

617
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,780
Do Hae Gang. That woman's name was Do Hae Gang.

618
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:14,520
There was a name card in the card and a Divorce Certificate, too.

619
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,760
But you know, I saw that she was the director of our company's legal team.

620
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,020
I need to find that woman.

621
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:30,020
I need to find her to find out if she's safe and apologize to her.

<i>I need to tell her how grateful I am, because thanks to her, I'm alive.</i>

623
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:40,200
But I can't gather enough nerve to do it.

624
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,940
If there's a chance, if there's a possibility that because of me,

00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,120

01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,780
I'll just take you home.

659
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:38,440
Just think of it as riding a taxi...

660
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,040
is also a lie.

661
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,480
I know I totally sound crazy with all the things I just said, so let's just get in the car and go.

662
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:02,160
Go to Seol Ri.

663
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:04,640
Pardon?

664
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:09,500
I briefly saw her earlier, and she didn't seem well.

665
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,500
I'll be going.

666
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:24,460
♫ <i>I was really okay </i> ♫

667
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:27,520
Thank you for worrying.
♫ <i>I was really okay </i> ♫

668
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:31,840
♫ <i>I came all this way sort of with a smile </i> ♫

669
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:36,180
I'll go home carefully and safely, so don't worry.

♫ <i>But now I’m filled with lies </i> ♫

671
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,120
Drive safely.

672

♫ <i>What can I do?</i> ♫

673
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,500
♫ <i>My heart that hated you so much </i> ♫

674
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,780
Just one more time.
♫ <i>My bad greed </i> ♫

675

♫ <i>It was all love </i> ♫

676

♫ <i>It was a dazzling love </i> ♫

677
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Can you just say it one more time?

686
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:55,360
<i>Yong Gi. Yong Gi! Yong Gi!</i>

687
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:00,960
It's my fault. I'm the one who said she was Yong Gi,
I told her she was Yong Gi.

688
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,960
<i>She looks like you, Mom.</i>

689
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,040
<i>Do Hae Gang? Do Hae Gang...</i>

690
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:10,880
<i>Someone sent this to you. It appears that the dump truck right there crashed into Dokgo Yong Gi's car.</i>

691
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,160
<i>I love you! As much as the universe!</i>

692
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,340
<i>Dokgo Yong Gi, where are you right now?</i>

693
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,140
<i>What are you saying right now?</i>

694
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:22,820
<i>I'll let you go when I can. I'll let you go when I'm able to.</i>

695
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:25,920
<i>Wait for me, Sunbae.</i>

696
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,680
<i>What do you mean she's dead?</i>
