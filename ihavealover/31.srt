00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,450
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by<br>the Forgotten Love Team at Viki</i>

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:16,900
That is a wall. While we feel that it's a wall which can't be moved past,

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,190
at that time, a climber quietly starts climbing that wall.

4
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,650
It's a poem that Do Hae Gang liked the most.

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,620
Without a drop of water,

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,810
a place where even a seed can't survive,

7
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,510
when people say that it's a wall of hopelessness,

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:53,540
a climber, without hurrying, goes forward.

9
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,040
It's me, Seok.

10
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,780
I said it's me. It's On Gi.

11
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,020
<i>It's my birthday. Congratulate me.</i>

12
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:43,340
All of my memories came back.

13
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,840
The memories that I had spent with you for four years as well.

14
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,140
Like a lighthouse, you always protect Do Hae Gang, night and day.

15
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:05,970
The past me and the present me are fighting right now. Did you see me a little while ago?

16
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:13,000
Sometimes, I feel a surge of anger I can't control. I hate, reproach and dislike him.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,820
I really want to reveal everything and I can't forgive him.

18
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:24,620
Then, I feel I don't have any right to forgive someone or not.

19
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,310
Why...

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,560
Is it September 25, 2011?

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,100
The day of the accident, when we met, was September 26,

22
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,600
and the day you woke up in my house was September 29.

23
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,430
Why did you even pretend forgetting about me?

24
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:11,100
It's not only to remove Choi Jin Eon from your life,

25
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,730
but it's also to erase me.

26
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,600
You tried to make me give up hope on you by hurting me.

27
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,750
You tried to cut me off.

28
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,560
Yes.

29
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,100
I didn't expect you would act this way.

30
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:43,210
I didn't really expect you'd offer to be friends with me after being humiliated so much.

31
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,820
I lost to you, Baek Seok.

32
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,320
So, what is your plan?

33
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,760
After you cut me off, cut Choi Jin Eon off, and cut everything off, what are you going to do?

34
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,970
I will return to the past me.

35
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,640
I will return to the Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals.

36
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,850
What?

37
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,200
To catch a tiger, you have to go into the tiger's den.

38
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,400
To protect Yong Gi, I have to be in the tiger's den.

39
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,120
About Pudoxin, the murder instigation,

40
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,160
and the death of the researcher, Kim Sun Yong,

41
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,270
if I don't have solid proof, I can't reveal anything.

42
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,330
If I act hastily and unwisely, he will be released with no suspicion again.

43
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,390
All I know are the circumstances of four years ago. That is also only a part of the information.

44
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,990
I will ally with Min Tae Seok.

45
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,870
After allying with him, I must put the handcuffs on his hands.

46
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:06,440
Even so, why Choi Jin Eon? He is on your side.

47
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,780
It's possible to put one handcuff on Min Tae Seok's hand and

48
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,090
the other handcuff on my hand.

49
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,120
<i>I want to fight with the past me, by myself.</i>

50
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,110
I don't want to drag him into this and cause him pain again,

51
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,720
revealing all those sides of me.

52
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,640
I am ashamed of myself.

53
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,120
I've finally come to know how much he had to endure.

54
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,590
Because of you, I got to know it.

55
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:00,730
Help me so I can correct my life, even now, Seok.

56
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,560
I can wash away the sins I've committed, one by one,

57
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,130
so that I can protect my poor sister,

58
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:16,530
and I can part from him. Help me Seok.

59
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,690
<i>Hae Gang<br>Connecting...</i>

60
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,320
<i>Since there is no answer, this call will be connected...</i>

61
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,850
<i>Hae Gang</i><br>Dialing...

62
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,120
<i>Hae Gang<br>Connecting...</i>

63
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,970
Yes. It's me, Hae Gang.

64
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,930
Where are you?

65
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:00,020
<i> Excuse me, Choi Jin Eon. It's me, Baek Seok.</i>

66
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:08,520
Right now, this is not your deed. Is it Hae Gang's idea?

67
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,180
Yes. Stop calling her. You have called her too many times even just today.

68
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,210
Don't think about only your feelings. Think about the feelings of the other side that doesn't want to answer your calls.

69
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:27,540
Where are you now? What are you two doing, where—

70
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,540
What time is it now? Where are you?

71
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,880
Tell me quickly where you are.

72
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,530
That's Do Hae Gang's decision, what she is does, with whom, where.

73
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,800
Do Hae Gang is not your wife nor your date any more.

74
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,070
Hae Gang and I will decide whether she is or not.

75
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:50,050
Don't recklessly come between us. Don't carelessly act as if you know. You don't know about Hae Gang and I!

76
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,290
<i>Hae Gang is my wife, and also because she is my lover,</i>

77
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,440
<i>Don't carelessly go near her.</i>

78
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,420
<i>I'm telling you not to go near that woman. Don't go near her, understand?</i>

79
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,960
No. Right now, to Do Hae Gang,

80
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,740
you're her ex-husband—no more, no less.

81
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,240
Moreover, she wants to put an end even to that relationship.

82
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,920
Please wait until Do Hae Gang calls you. Then.

83
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,500
Sorry.

84
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,090
Don't be sorry.

85
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,770
"Between Calmness and Passion"

86
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:53,610
The music Jerk Do Hae Gang heard when she had a headache.

87
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,330
Although people can't remember everything that happens in their lives,

88
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:08,290
I believe that they will never forget what is precious to them.

89
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,340
The dialog in the movie Jerk Do Hae Gang liked.

90
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,350
The volume please.

91
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,290
Why aren't you drinking? Let's drink together.

92
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,860
It's still today, even if there are only a few minutes left.

93
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,190
Why can't you just say happy birthday once for me?

94
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,910
I want to hear that from you before today passes.

95
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,410
I waited all day.

96
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:09,010
I've waited days before. No— I waited four years to hear those words.

97
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,850
There are three minutes left. Can't you say it?

98
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,220
Is it your birthday?

99
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,600
Hae Gang. Do Hae Gang!

100
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,420
What are you doing here now?

101
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,570
Why are you being here like this?

102
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,370
You're acting very strange. This is going overboard. This is an overreaction!

103
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,590
In my eyes, you're purposely trying to avoid me.

104
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:54,890
You desperately avoid my birthday and avoid me. You seem hiding from me.

105
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,320
If you want to fall into expansive delusion, do so within the reasonable bounds.

106
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,250
So what if it's your birthday? So what about you?

107
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,830
Wake up. You still don't get it?

108
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,860
I came because I am curious about him.

109
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,610
I came because I was curious about the past four years after this man's tears stuck in my head.

110
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,080
I haven't thought of you once.

111
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,200
Because this person's eyes were so warm, and because his words were so comforting,

112
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,100
I just didn't want to go back to the hotel.

113
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:34,010
There's one minute left. Happy birthday. Happy?

114
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,650
I'll be going. Thank you for today.

115
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,810
It's late, I'll take you home.

116
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,440
- Would you?<br>- Let's go.

117
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,580
She said she's going with me.

118
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:58,810
I'm warning you. Don't try to get between us.

119
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,690
<i>I'm asking you a favor.</i>

120
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,430
Don't ever lay a hand on Do Hae Gang that easily.

00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,300
Why is it Hae Gang?

148
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,050
Why are you thinking of leaving Cheon Nyeon Parmaceuticals, that's like your other self, to someone who doesn't share a drop of blood with you?

149
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,420
Tell me honestly because I need to see the end of this with you today.

150
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,260
Sit down.

151
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,450
Hae Gang is my friend's daughter.

152
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,450
What? Your friend? What friend?

153
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,290
Ji Hoon.

154
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,290
The one who died in the mountains?

155
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,740
The one who keeps on following you in your dreams?

156
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,080
Yes.

157
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,160
And?

158
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,820
Ssanghwasan was Ji Hoon's.

159
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,760
Ji Hoon had developed it.

160
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,360
And?

161
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,340
After he died, that Ssanghwasan,

162
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:31,780
I took it from him, claiming that I developed it first.

163
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:40,230
Like fate, Hae Gang comes to me as my daughter-in-law, and by night, that guy comes to find me.

164
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,430
I accepted Hae Gang as my destiny.

165
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,600
I was finally able to sleep again.

166
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,690
Jin Eon can develop medicine with Hae Gang running Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals. They can live together like that—

167
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,890
They already divorced. They are not related any more.

168
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,790
What do you mean live like that? How would they?

169
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,920
If Jin Eon finds out, he'll go crazy.

170
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,140
Why are you passing your sins onto your son?

171
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,660
You stretch out your legs and sleep while my son lives as a sinner beside Hae Gang forever?

172
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,300
No, I won't allow that.

173
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,940
I can't leave her by Jin Eon.

174
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,400
While she lives and even when she dies or returns from the dead,

175
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,920
she'll grab, shake, dig into, and scratch my son.

176
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,600
Jin Eon can't win her.

177
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,540
With her coldness and noxiousness, Jin Eon will get hurt again.

178
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:37,390
Even now, he's covered in scars. And Ssanghwasan on top of it?

179
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,130
He said that they had started over.

180
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,890
Since they lost each other, they would change.

181
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,810
Let's believe in both Jin Eon and Hae Gang.

182
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,950
The scar just means that the pain has passed.

183
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,170
It means they were healed. It means they overcame it.

184
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:00,000
Forget everything and make a decision.

185
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,600
Is it me or is it Hae Gang?

186
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,680
What?

187
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,490
Answer me. Is it me or is it Hae Gang?

188
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,270
Se Hee.

189
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,610
I hope my last memory

190
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,980
is my son's happy face.

191
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,100
You got rejected?

192
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,680
<i>You were kicked to the curb? Right?</i>

193
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,500
What kind of love is this? It's not even a roller coaster. It's already over after a few shouts.

194
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,020
How long had you waited in line all this time? But you're told to get off as soon as you got on.

195
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,220
Aren't you dizzy? And you feel like throwing up?

196
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,000
It's written all over your face. You look way older than me.

197
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,340
This is what I think, Jin Eon.

198
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,700
Your wife is normal and you're the one who's abnormal.

199
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,000
Cheating is vengeance. How is it love?

200
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,860
You sure do dream big. Who would understand why you are making such a fuss?

201
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,940
You shot the poisonous arrow first. Then you are waiting a cupid arrow in return. Does it make sense?

202
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:31,100
<i>You're the one who's strange. Do Hae Gang is the completely normal one.</i>

203
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,620
You've erred and failed.

204
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,740
I guess all that's left is for you to lose your mind.

205
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,630
I'm just saying this because I'm worried about you.

206
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,850
I am afraid you are jumping around like a crazy person without knowing if you are in heaven or on the earth.

207
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,630
Think about it. You wife is foaming at the mouth to exact revenge.

208
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:55,380
Dad tries to hand over Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals to your ex-wife who looks like a dog bone. Moreover, you are enemy—

209
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,960
Of course, you'd go crazy. Why wouldn't you? Why wouldn't you lose your mind?

210
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,720
This sister is truly worried about you, Jin Eon.

211
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,100
No matter how hard I think about it, Hae Gang is a swamp, where you sink down to die or become prey for a alligator.

212
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,490
What should we do with you?

213
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:22,080
If you've said everything you wanted to say, then leave.

214
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,730
As you can see, today I can't go any further.

215
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,860
If you stay by me, you may get struck by my wrath. So leave.

216
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,330
Haven't you seen this coming? You really didn't see this coming?

217
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,700
Of course I did. I really did.

218
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,480
I expected this, prepared myself, and steeled my mind, but

219
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,600
now that I've confronted this, right in front of my eyes, I don't know what to do at all.

220
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,780
So don't bother me, Noona.

221
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,860
So you're just going to sit there and take it?

222
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,950
You're going to let your position and Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals be taken away from you?

223
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,700
Let's join forces. Be on my side.

224
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,940
Let's block her from getting the company, together.

225
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,800
You must hate it as much as me.

226
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,020
Is she a salmon? Why does she come back? Who is waiting for her?

227
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,970
You should have just left her to become the daughter-in-law of the dumpling family. Why poke at someone who was living happily and cause this mess?

228
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,050
You're the stupid one.

229
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:28,070
You're the one who dug this all up.

230
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:34,230
When she was with the dumpling house family, she looked happy. She looked human.

231
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,800
If you had left her to get married to Kang Seol Ri's brother, she'd have been happy and we'd have been happy.

232
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,960
It wasn't going to work out anyway.

233
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,770
You ruined it all. Your selfish love for her is ruining you both. Do you know that, Jin Eon?

234
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,530
Get out.

235
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,710
I said get out.

236
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,150
Noona!

237
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,210
Didn't you hear me?

238
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,570
Get out. Get out!

239
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,680
I-I hear you.

240
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,600
I'll leave. I'm leaving right now.

241
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,190
But you know what?

242
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,620
Do Hae Gang threw you away to Seol Ri.

243
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:30,450
Since she threw you away, she told me to come clear you away from her sight.

244
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,790
It's not like you're garbage, to pick up or clear away. That girl, sheesh!

245
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:45,910
Let's meet today. I got what you asked for.

246
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:50,020
Wow... Already?

247
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,600
How? It hasn't been very long since we last met.

248
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,660
I don't think Dokgo Yong Gi would have given it to you easily.

249
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,490
You're not a close family, you're practically strangers.

250
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:10,480
Did your sister really give it to you? What does she trust about you?

251
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,090
I stole it without her knowing.

252
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,900
Her luggage's passcode was pathetically her birthday. She doesn't know.

253
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,610
Wow. Of course!

254
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,590
<i> You did well. <i></i></i>

255
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,170
Choi Jin Eon's position... I mean get my position ready immediately.

256
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,810
I always keep the bullets loaded in the gun. So don't worry about it.

257
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,470
Aren't you going to regret this?

258
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:37,570
Are you sure you won't regret this later, Lawyer Do?

259
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,000
<i> I feel like I throw the naive and innocent brother-in-law into the dirty and sinful bog.</i>

260
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,950
I already regret too much.

261
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:50,030
<i>Okay. I'll be at the office after 2, so I"ll see you there.</i>

262
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,210
I will meet with you later.

263
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,420
<i>Daily Notes for Research of Developing a New Drug<br>New Drug: Pudoxin<br>Resercher: Kim Sun Yong</i>

264
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,600
I will trust her for now and suspect her later.

265
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,090
I will be able to see her next move only if I trust her for now.

266
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,370
I will find out if she's fake or real along the way.

267
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:18,280
You're saying that she really asked for that position, kicking out Jin Eon?

268
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,940
Yes, she even said to make up some wrongdoing to kick out...

269
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,760
She is sinister and cruel.

270
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,840
How do you try to hand over Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals to such a vicious and dirty devil person?

271
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,420
It doesn't make sense. It makes no sense, Dad.

272
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,090
I will confirm with Hae Gang.

273
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:43,020
You do that for sure.

274
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,020
Do Hae Gang is coming to take revenge on Jin Eon.

275
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,860
Jin Eon is getting much more of punishment from her than what he gave to her.

276
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,940
She's not someone who would do that. Even when they separated, she said they were not over.

277
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:00,350
She said Jin Eon would return to her and that she would wait.

278
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,540
I trust Hae Gang.

279
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,400
Father and son are the same. How don't you have any keen eye for a woman?

280
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,430
<i>You are being deceived by her. Both you and Jin Eon are being deceived by Do Hae Gang. Ahh, it's so frustrating.</i>

281
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,730
What she does as soon as she's alive, as soon as she comes back?

282
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,580
She's a monster, Dad. She's the devil, Satan.

283
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,030
Please get a hold of yourself!

284
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,200
Ah, seriously! Why isn't it here? Why?

285
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:43,790
No. Come out. Come out. Hurry, please come out!

286
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:49,360
Woo Joo, haven't you seen the yellow envelope in my bag?

287
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,170
<i>Come and eat! Woo Joo, hold your mom's hand and come out quickly!</i>

288
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,750
Excuse me, excuse me. Did you touch my belongings by any chance?

289
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,000
What do you mean?

290
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,690
My luggage! Did you go through it?

291
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:15,580
What? No, I didn't. Why would I go through your things without your permission?

292
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,630
Because... Because...

293
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,300
Why? What disappeared?

294
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,030
- You really didn't go through my things, right? <br> - No.

295
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,100
Then who would have?

296
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,150
Eesh!

297
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:39,140
Woo Joo, why is your mom like that?

298
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,430
What on earth did she lose so she is restless and so irritated?

299
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,580
Can't you knock?

300
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:57,140
My mind is in hurry. My mind is burning fully like a live volcano right now. The moment you flashed on my head,

301
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,390
my mind is boiling like the hot lava.

302
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:06,970
That's none of my business. As what you said, I am just a yellowish flesh.

303
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,480
Forget it. You must forget about it quickly, Miss Dokgo Yong Gi.

304
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,450
What is none of my business? You told me to trust you. You said "Let's live together"!

305
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,210
You told me to stay next to that yellowish flesh.

306
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,770
What's your reason? What's your motive? What are you plotting?

307
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,090
<i>Tell me honestly!</i>

308
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,520
<i>I am worried about you, Miss Dokgo Yong Gi.</i>

309
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:34,460
I got to like Dokgo Woo Joo. Yong Gi and Woo Joo are the words I think about the most,

310
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,100
with a bad feeling toward the former (Yong Gi) and with a good feeling toward the latter (Woo Joo).

311
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,090
That's my reason, my motive, and my plot, Miss Dokgo Yong Gi.

312
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,700
Didn't you take an international airmailed envelope from my luggage?

313
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,700
<i>With what motive would I take that?</i>

314
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,380
That's because... Because—

315
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,460
Because... Follow that line of thought to the end.

316
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,200
Your brother! To bring it to Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals.

317
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,700
So you're saying the contents of that envelope is related to Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals?

318
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,950
Such as the whistle blowing contents, right? Didn't you lock the trunk?

319
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,210
Of course I locked it.

320
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,270
Then someone unlocked the passcode and took it. What's your passcode?

321
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,500
My birthday.

322
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,970
Then the culprit must be someone who knows your birthday.

323
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:31,340
Well, if someone wants to know my birthday, isn't it easy to find out? Especially if I'm being played with?

324
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,730
I will meet with my brother.

325
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:46,030
<i> Woo Joo, your mom will be in danger if she has this. <i></i></i>

326
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:49,200
<i>Will bad guys come looking for us again?</i>

327
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,960
<i>That's why your aunt needs to take it.</i>

328
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,890
<i>Can you keep this a secret from your mom?</i>

329
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,130
<i>And from other people, too.</i>

330
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:06,080
<i>You have to keep this secret.</i>

331
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,810
<i>Promise.</i>

332
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,950
Check it.

333
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:49,770
We could make the video clip be copied. But the daily notes were hand-written.

334
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:54,420
It explains why you risk your life for Kim Sun Yong's daily notes.

335

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by<br>the Forgotten Love Team at Viki</i>

336
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:12,120
Does your sister also know that the lawyer who represented our company for Kim Sun Yong's suit was you, Lawyer Do?

337
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,560
That's why she loathes me. She said she would pay back.

338
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,780
To catch me and President Min Tae Seok.

339
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:24,610
So how are you thinking of blocking your sister this time?

340
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,760
Let's first hear how you plan to get rid of Choi Jin Eon.

341
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,920
This device of blocking wiretap costs ₩ 30 million. At time like this, I realize you are really a Chaebol (tycoon).

342
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,220
I am overawed by you as much as I can't stand this punk.

343
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,270
Did you receive several billion won worth of stocks since 6 or 7 years old and

344
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,620
make them swell out to the several ten billion won in 10 years?

345
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,640
Probably.

346
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,670
Ah, Damn!

347
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,490
Hey, Chaebol (rich kid), what do you guys live for?

348
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,920
What do you pour yourself into, when you already have and have gained everything?

349
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:05,750
We live by pouring ourselves into fighting each other.

350
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:11,530
Looking at each other's weaknesses, we live leaning on one another's weaknesses.

351
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,960
What?

352
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,210
This is my brother-in-law's paper company that is in Cayman Islands.

353
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,020
Let's hit him with this. He has several tens of the borrowed-name bank accounts.

354
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:29,760
Wow, he sure did put away a lot. It's a good thing we did this hacking.

355
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,300
All of President Min Tae Seok's weaknesses are now in your hands, how can he get rid of you?

356
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,020
He's the one about to go, and Hae Gang has no clue whatsoever.

357
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,910
But isn't Hae Gang going overboard?

358
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:47,220
Even reporting you to the police. It appears she's determined to humiliate you.

359
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,070
It looks like a dog fight here on out between you two.

360
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,990
Let's just brush ourselves off and leave them to go after each other.

361
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,970
Let's pack our things and just go to the research department.

362
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:03,450
You and Hae Gang have seen all each other, but this kind of dog fight,

363
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,670
this really isn't right, Jin Eon.

364
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:11,810
It's not just your love, but your souls that can be ruined.

365
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,980
Even if people can't remember everything that happens in their lives,

366
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:20,600
I believe that they will never forget what is truly precious.

367
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,450
What?

368
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:28,620
This is the dialog in the movie we watched together in 2003, Autumn. Our favorite dialog.

369
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,450
Even if she loses her memory, even if the worst of her memories comes back,

370
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,910
I believe that she will never have forgotten what is precious.

371
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,600
Later, after a long time has passed...

372
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,830
In order for this painful period to remain as a precious memory,

373
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,930
I have no choice but to fight now. I just have to win.

374
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,140
If I win,

375
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,560
I filled some money in brother-in-law account. Tomorrow, the audit will be conducted.

376
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:14,980
Next week, we will call the board meeting. Within this month we can get rid of him at the extraordinary general meeting.

377
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,690
You well know this isn't even work.

378
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,110
Let's keep this in the rental safety box.

379
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:28,210
Or we can keep it in a safe where it requires two keys to open.

380
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,530
From my perspective, if this gets incinerated,

381
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:35,120
I lose my card that guarantees my sister's security.

382
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,350
I can secure it in a safe, but I can't turn it over to you.

383
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:47,500
Let's prepare a safe, that nobody can't open unless together.

384
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,310
That sounds great.

385
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,290
You can keep the USB. I have a copy.

386
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,690
How do you plan to keep your sister's mouth shut?

387
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,900
Will it suffice to send her abroad?

388
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,190
It'll be difficult for me to do more than that because she is my bloody sister, no matter what.

389
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,230
Make sure to send her away. She must leave, if not,

390
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,690
That's right.

391
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,010
This was with me.

392
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,010
Why does it all rest on my doing?

393
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:31,150
Why is my name in every place that Min Tae Seok's name should be?

394
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:37,010
After making me dead, you did posthumous execution with the dead one.

395
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,790
<i>You comforted my mother every year on the anniversary of my death.</i>

396
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,240
How did you come to that?

397
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,850
Even four years ago, you acted humanely even though you were incompetent.

398
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,420
Give me all of the materials you put on my name.

399
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,480
Otherwise, I will make this matter issued.

400
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,110
The fax you asked me to find out,

401
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:09,090
It's come from a neighborhood stationary store. This is an address and telephone number.

402
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,390
And look into every CCTV within 1 km of radius.

403
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,920
Ah, yes. I got it.

404
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:19,550
Excuse me, President. Your wife...

405
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,030
Managing Director Do Hae Gang is over in that office.

406
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:29,030
What is his wife? That person has never lived a minute as his wife.

407
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,050
Let's go.

408
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,600
Let's go eat.

409
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,800
What? Just like that? You don't need to see her? You can't do that?

410
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,260
Let's go.

411
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,690
Okay.

412
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,250
Hae Gang.

413
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,420
Hello.

414
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,330
Jin Eon went over there.

415
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,820
You look better in lab coats than what you're wearing now. Both of you.

416
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,920
Oh, really? I have some things to discuss, would you like to have lunch?

417
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,190
What do you have to discuss with me?

418
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,800
Let's talk while we eat. Let's go.

419
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,320
Multiple... Multiple personality?

420
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,730
Who? Ah, Manager Go?

421
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,490
No.

422
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,450
Do Hae Gang. How many faces does she have?

423
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:50,110
I'm not sure which direction I'm supposed to dance. It's so hard.

424
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,470
We're having lunch with Hae Gang.

425
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:01,440
-Did you tell her I was coming too?<br>-No.

426
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,430
Ask her again.

427
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:10,110
Actually I have him too. Can I bring my attachment?

428
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:14,100
If you mind at all, like an Arabian,

429
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:18,900
I'll put a black Keffiyeh and make him sit quietly next to me.

430
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,880
You just think you brought Lawyer Do's horse that you raise at home.

431
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,390
You, two eat together. I'll pass.

432
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:33,530
No, you can't do that. If you received the birthday present, you have to pay back of it.

433
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:37,210
Have some conscious, you idiotic rich punk.

434

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by<br>the Forgotten Love Team at Viki</i>

435
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,360
I'll call Japanese restaurant at Hal Ra Hotel and you go there.

436
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,660
You're not going?

437
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,410
No. Eat comfortably.

438
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,930
Can't he be forgiven forever if he made one mistake?

439
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,760
We're not God, we're human.

440
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,240
As humans we should let things slide, and forgive each other by giving a few of hits on the cheeks.

441
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,720
There is no such thing as a perfect person or a perfect love.

442
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,560
People fill each other's hole.

443
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,510

Alright, I'll sing. Close your eyes, Woo Joo.

493
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:18,100
♫ Everytime I ask you when, how and where

494
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:26,190
♫ You only answer perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

495
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:33,370
♫ And days pass like this me, growing desperate

496
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:41,370
♫ And you, you always answer, perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

497
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:49,410
♫ You are wasting time thinking, thinking

498
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,480
<i>Did you take Dokgo Yong Gi's belongings, Hyung?</i>

499
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,700
<i>I'm coming to get it, so return it if you took it. I'll be there by 4.</i>

500
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,460
<i>I really, really love you ♡</i><br><i>Yong Gi Unni</i>

501
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,470
<i>You can't compare to me, Kang Seol Ri.</i>

502
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:45,330
<i>Even if I died, even if I became a different person,</i>

503
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:48,950
<i>even if I lost my memory, you have never once won over me.</i>

504
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:54,480
<i>Do you know why? It's because you've never had that man.</i>

505
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:01,050
<i>Because you have never received that man's love even once. You just keep hoping.</i>

506
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,200
<i>You alone call that love. You call that kind of thing, love.</i>

507
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,640
<i> You are just stubbornly insisting it, understand?</i>

508
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,960
Just stop.

509
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,020
I'll clean this room for you so you should stay out.

510
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,040
No. I'll do it.

511
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,480
I will throw it myself. I'll throw it all away.

512
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,320
Why would you throw it away? You can give it to the people who need it.

513
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,280
I don't want that.

514
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:37,900
I want to burn this, Dad. I have to.

515
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,740
With my own hands, all of this.

516
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:46,610
Without leaving out a thing, I'm going to burn it all.

517
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:50,940
Fine, burn it.

518
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:58,170
Burn it all without leaving a thing. But then it has to be over. Today has to be the end.

519
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:02,160
Don't only burn the stuff,

520
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,580
but burn that heart, alright?

521
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,640
Seol Ri unni.

522
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,310
Oh, Baek Joo.

523
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:40,060
Dad said that you would come. You really came.

524
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:48,010
Are you going to live with us now?

525
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,650
Yeah.

526
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:55,240
You're not going to go anywhere, right?

527
00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:01,670
You're not going to leave us, right?

528
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,270
Yeah.

529
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,830
Who needs Yong Gi unni?

530
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:14,100
We also don't need someone like her.

531
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:19,540
She said she forgot us. She forgot everything.

532
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,050
She said she doesn't even know who we are.

533
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,210
Does that make any sense? I've forgotten her, too.

534
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:32,330
We, too, have forgotten Yong Gi Unnie.

535
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:39,390
Seol Ri unni, really. I'm being honest.

536
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,450
Unni.

537
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,930
Yong Gi unni.

538
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,260
Unni!

539
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:03,540
Unni, unni!

I'm uncomfortable going to the house, Chairman. Let's eat out.

<i>I'm telling you to come to the house to make you uncomfortable, so don't say anything and come.</i>

<i>I'll see you at the house.</i>

551

<i>You know it isn't what I want.</i>

553
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,360
At my position, it's hard to reject Lawyer Do's request.

554
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,760
I have to survive, too.

555
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:08,110
Even right now, if you're willing to accept the Chief Researcher position at the Central Research Department, I'll let the audit stop.

00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:12,120
Even though you lose your face a little bit, you won't lose your face completely.

<i>I think you and Hae Gang both think of me as too easy.</i>

559
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:33,360
Why do you think I'll just sit by and take it?

560
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,620
Why don't you think I might strike you first?

561
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,820
Strike me? You, Brother-in-law?

562
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,920

<i>TY Resourse & Investment</i>

564
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:56,820
I'm not going to the auditors, I'm going straight to the prosecutors.

00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,290
I was behind the hacking.

568
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,030
What?

569
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:19,410
I am holding your lifeline, not Hae Gang.

570
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:23,700
My hands, these hands, can do everything.

571
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,600
And on top of it, it's too easy.

572
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:31,090
If I press a mouse, it'll be over.

573
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,340
I'm going to keep my position. I'm not going anywhere.

574
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:44,590
Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals isn't going to you or Hae Gang. I'm going to do it. I will get it.

575
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:48,350
So don't bring Hae Gang into the company.

576
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:52,930
Having her re-enter the company, you block it from happening. You have to without fail.

577

Well, how may we help you today?

581
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,840
I'm here to see President Min Tae Seok.

582
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,650
Ah, you're the younger brother? I received word from downstairs.

583
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,860
<i>Please wait a moment.</i>

584
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:36,050
Yes, President, your younger brother is here.

585
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,200
Please stop.

586
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,530
Yes.

587
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,080
He said to come in.

588
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,880
My younger brother is here.

589
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:54,740
Please leave us.

590
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,220
I'll be awaiting your reply.

591
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:09,410
Pororo Ahjussi.

592
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:12,740
Woo Joo, Woo Joo.

593
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:19,030
It's been long.

594
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:20,840
Yes.

595
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,670
I'll keep Woo Joo while your speaking with your brother.

596
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:28,530
Please call me when you're finished talking.

597
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:32,480
Will Miss Dokgo Woo Joo play with Mr. Pororo for a little while?

598
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,600
Do you remember this Ahjussi?

599
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:45,160
It's Hyung.

600
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,200
My Hyung.

601
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:52,210
He's a good brother.

602
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,560
Like your mother did, he raised me.

603
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,030
If I didn't have my brother, I wouldn't be here either.

604
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,780
Please greet my brother before you go.

605
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,550
Hello.

606
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,100
Goodbye.

607
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:44,670
This is really good, but why aren't you eating?

608
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,940
Just watching you eat is much more enjoyable.

609
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,750
It's so sweet just watching you.

610
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:58,980
This is a secret that I'm only telling you,

611
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:05,150
but lately I've been so sad. And I got the horns grown (get angry).

612
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:11,120
But, when I see you, my horns melt away in my eyes

613
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:19,200
and the sadness in my heart has melted. It's all gone, because you're so lovely.

614
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,950
My mom says that too.

615
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:26,230
Just watching me, she says she melts.

616
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,950
It all melts away.

617
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:34,040
Did you meet your aunt?

618
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:41,020
Oh, the really pretty lady who looks just like your mom.

619
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:46,200
Did you speak with her, too?

620
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,950
She doesn't like me.

621
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:50,110
What?

622
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:54,130
"Aren't you going away? Get out, now!"

623
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,240
That's what she shouted to me.

624
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:02,830
Do you know who that Ahjumma is?

625
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:05,750
I know her better than anyone in the world.

626
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:10,170
Then, is she a good lady or bad lady?

627
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:12,960
Of course, she's a very good lady.

628
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,740
She is Mom's sister and your aunt.

629
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,440
Then does she keep promises well?

630
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,350
Did you make a promise with your aunt?

631
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,370
What kind of promise?

632
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,250
It's not me, it's really not me.

633
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,360
Then who is it?

634
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,520
You know. That's why you're not surprised or curious.

635
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,510
Who is it, tell me.

636
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,610
Her twin sister.

637
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:48,480
Who?

638
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,740
Do Hae Gang.

639
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,840
Her birthday

640
00:58:54,840 --> 00:59:00,330
What kind of promise did you make with your aunt? You're not going to tell me?

641
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:06,490
She must have told you not to tell anyone.

642
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:20,020
Please tell her to quietly return the property Do Hae Gang took from Dokgo Yong Gi without her knowing.

643
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,080
Pardon?

644
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,220
Property taken without her knowledge?

645
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,320
Doctor, you know, too?

646
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:28,940
Oh, but it was a secret?

647
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,160
Please tell me in detail what she has to return,

648
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,500
that's how even I can return it.

649
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:44,240
Do Hae Gang took the whistle-blowing video clip and the daily notes of Kim Sun Yong's Pudoxin research secretly.

650
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,340
Pardon? What did you say?

651
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:04,740
<i>- This is for you.<br>- Thank you.</i>

652
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,250
Thank you for the flowers.

653
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:14,270
Did you tell me to buy them on purpose for Choi Jin Eon to see?

654
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,620
Yeah.

655
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:20,640
If he sees you coming here, we should appear as if we're dating.

656
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,000
I'm okay with dating.

657
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,230
To appear real, it's better to do a real date.

658
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:31,640
Was Mon Tae Joon's lawsuit turned over his mother?

659
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,100
Yeah.

660
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:38,790
Here. These are the documents on the people who participated in the Pudoxin clinical trials.

01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:42,780
Let's divide and meet these people on this list and check their side effects shown.

662
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,850
Let's warn them the possibility of danger and lead them to the class action suit.

663
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:49,210
Wow, how did these documents...?

664
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:54,230
4 years ago, I save this document because of Kang Seol Ri.

665
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:56,520
What?

666
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:01,440
Kang Seol Ri also participated in the clinical trials of Pudoxin.

667
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,380
What did you say?

668
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:08,200
Keep our names out of it and take her to the hospital to get tested for the bone density.

669
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,190
It might be nothing, but just in case.

<i>-What?<br>-Your son is like a leech.</i>

674
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:29,750
<i> Really? </i>

675
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,410
<i>I'm going to go crazy because of you!</i>

676
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:33,390
<i>You have no shame, just what are you doing?</i>

677
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:35,260
<i>Do you really want to see me go insane?</i>

678
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:37,590
<i>We decided to start from today.</i>

679
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:39,290
<i>What?</i>

680
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:42,510
<i>Not Hae Gang, give your seat to me. I'll do it, Father.</i>

681
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:46,260
<i>It isn't Jin Eon, it's you I'm throwing away. There's no need to return to the company.</i>

682
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,810
<i>You say you'll win over me?</i>

683
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:49,580
<i>Yeah, I'm going to win over you, Hae Gang.</i>

684
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,760
<i>Okay, let's see.</i>
