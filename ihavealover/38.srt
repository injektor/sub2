Timing and Subtitles brought to you by<br>the Forgotten Love Team at Viki

2
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,260
Let's go.

3
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,560
What is this about?

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,050
I'll cook dinner for you. Let's go.

5
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,630
Huh?

6
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,750
I'll make you breakfast tomorrow, too.

7
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,430
Let's go.

8
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,070
Excuse me, Vice Chairman.

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,810
What's the matter?

10
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,890
Excuse me.

11
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:10,840
Well... Where are you going? I have to know President's whereabouts.

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,470
Vice Chairman is going to make a meal in person.

13
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,090
Pardon?

14
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,530
Let's go, Vice Chairman.

15
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,770
Okay.

16
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,470
Then, work hard.

17
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,210
Bye.

18
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:35,290
What is this? People in high positions are holding hands without dignity.

19
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,700
Isn't it just a show?

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,580
Show?

21
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,280
- Ahh. A political show!<br>- Yes.

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,670
A rumor spreads that the power struggle has started within the group.

23
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,390
They show their alliance indirectly.

24
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,390
That's right.

25
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,890
In the bright daytime, that is not a walk of love, but a walk of politics.

26
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,140
A proclamation of war that has taken an aim at the opponent.

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,220
That means they are allies.

28
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,950
Then, it's time for me to line up in a different line.

29
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,070
Did you see something you were not supposed to see? Why are you freezing up?

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,410
I was at a loss when I saw you all of sudden.

31
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,790
I apologize, Chairman.

32
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,700
Are you going out or coming in?

33
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,930
We are going out.

34
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,510
What brings you here?

35
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,990
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

36
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,450
We try to get fresh air and eat dinner out.

37
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:07,140
Your mom has been pressing me to take you to dinner since she owes you a dinner.

38
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,320
She's waiting for you in the parking lot.

39
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,400
I have a previous engagement.

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,310
Just the two of you have dinner today.

41
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,850
A previous engagement? You two?

42
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,400
Yes.

43
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,850
The door's open. Let's get on together and go down.

44
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,980
What are you doing without getting on?

45
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,840
Chairman is waiting. Get on quickly.

46
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,550
Whether it's for business or personal, it's quite reassuring to see you being together and it looks good, too.

47
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,230
Everybody is probably watching you.

48
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:09,450
Calculate and be careful of your actions.

49
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,440
Ah, he should have picked up the phone. Seriously.

50
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,450
Since the air is cold, why don't you get in the car and wait?

51
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,080
I am fine.

52
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,310
Don't the prosecutor son and the doctor daughter ask you to quit your job?

53
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,480
They did for a while, but they are quiet these days.

54
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,220
Thanks to whom, they can do well?

55
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,040
Tuition, the marriage fund... We shall be eternally grateful to the chairman.

56
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
They are doing well because of their smart brains.

57
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,750
The chairman is coming out.

58
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,460
What is this? Why does he bring the attachment without asking me?

59
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,410
Why are you outside? It's cold.

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,640
Why are you here? Are you going, too?

61
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,410
Only the two of us are going. Your son has a previous engagement.

62
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,660
With whom?

63
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,720
With her?

64
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,260
It's not a personal matter, but business.

65
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,820
How about Wednesday evening? I don't have anything scheduled on that day.

66
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,470
Anyhow, you are skillful in disappointing me.

67
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,640
If you had picked up the phone, we wouldn't have wasted the trip.

68
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,320
Check your phone and see how many times he tried to call you.

69
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,800
I have worried so much, all the way to here, whether something happened to you or not.

70
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,180
Get on, quickly.

71
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm going.

72
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,810
You are full these days even if you don't eat, aren't you?

73
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,960
The position of Vice Chairman, 10.5% of the company shares...

74
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,360
Since things already went this way, you just work hard. Hard, very hard, okay?

75
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,060
Should we use my car?

76
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,080
Yes. You drive it. I had a drink.

77
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,650
Did you have a drink during the daytime? With whom?

78
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,410
Is it correct for the two of them to meet for company business?

79
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,290
It doesn't seem so, does it?

80
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,200
Don't you feel a queer atmosphere?

81
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,150
I feel suspicious no matter what. If it were for business, they should have done it at the company.

82
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,440
Where on earth are they going near the end of the business day?

83
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,210
What were my father's last words?

84
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,660
I heard he cut the rope himself.

85
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,960
Before he cut it, it seems he would have said some final words.

86
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,150
Usually in those circumstances, people leave last words for their family.

87
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,070
What words did he leave?

88
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,890
Yeah,

89
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:21,300
to take care of you both. He asked me to take care of Yong Gi and Hae Gang.

90
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,100
- Hae Gang?<br>- Yeah.

91
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,820
My father doesn't know my name, Chairman.

92
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,720
The name my father left for me was Ong Gi. Dokgo Ong Gi.

93
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,360
Hae Gang asked about her father,

94
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,020
about what his last words were.

95
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,210
In the mountain? What were his last words?

96
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Why are you stopping in the middle of talking? What did he say before he died?

97
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,420
He said for me to take care of Ssanghwasan well.

98
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,790
Then you didn't take it away. Why did you say you took it away so you made me guilty as well?

99
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,370
If you didn't take it, but you were asked to take care of it, then tell Jin Eon in advance,

100
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,300
so you won't make him suffer, needlessly.

101
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,960
Do you understand?

102
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,520
So, what are you going to make? Do you have a plan?

103
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,340
Monkfish is in season.

104
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,190
I'll make the spicy steamed monkfish, oyster stew, steamed vegetable, and fried tofu.

105
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,620
That much for a dinner.

106
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,060
Why? Shouldn't I hold your arm?

107
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,040
You said you know all of my heart.

108
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:56,550
I'll make you happy as well.

109
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,720
I love you, Choi Jin Eon.

110
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,390
That's enough. Who didn't love before? Seriously.

111
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,620
I am sorry. My wife is so pretty.

112
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,960
Who is your wife?

113
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,630
Only today. You are my wife only for today.

114
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,420
Hold my arm.

115
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,600
₩9,800 for Monkfish <br> ₩4,800 for Flounder

116
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,210
They don't have the razor you are using.

117
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,110
Just use this one.

118
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,670
You can use my skin lotion. Let's go buy pajamas now.

119
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,840
Pajamas?

120
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,920
Where am I going to sleep tonight?

121
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,290
Wherever you want to sleep.

122
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,210
Ahh.

123
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,900
Let's go buy pajamas.

124
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,090
Honey.

125
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,610
What, Honey?

126
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,090
Thank you for making me happy.

127
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,870
How can you already be happy? I haven't cooked for you yet.

128
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,170
Seriously. What am I going to do if I'm already this happy?

129
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:05,630
I wish time would stop right at this moment.

130
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,010
While I'm in the middle of chopping this monkfish and you in the middle of trimming the bean sprouts?

131
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah.

132
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,870
Without eating the food I cook for you?

133
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,090
- Yeah.<br>- Why?

134
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,980
Because it's the last meal you're cooking for me.

135
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,900
You're wrong. I'm going to cook breakfast for you tomorrow, too.

136
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,610
Are you going to leave?

137
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,740
Depends on how you do.

138
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,630
Do you want to get hit with this monkfish?

139
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,410
I better go. I can't stay being treated this way.

140
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,540
I'll wipe off here.

141
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,900
The bean sprouts, it should be enough for you to eat alone.

142
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,360
There's too much monkfish for you to eat by yourself.

143
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,050
Save it to make a stew tomorrow morning and eat it by yourself.

144
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,640
This is exactly the happiness I was wanting,

145
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:35,680
not too big or not too small,

146
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,060
just this much happiness.

147
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:51,110
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by<br>the Forgotten Love Team at Viki

148
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,960
My face is going to wear out. Stop that and eat some.

149
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,720
Out of all the countless women,

150
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,430
thank you for finding me.

151
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,550
After chasing you to death for a year and seven months,

152
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,020
thank you for agreeing to date me.

153
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,550
Thank you for loving me to overflowing, too.

154
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,870
In the 2002 World Cup, Korea vs. Spain,

155
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,520
in the miraculous 5-3 penalty shootout victory,

156
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,560
That day, thank you for giving me a miracle, too.

157
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,920
After six years, for giving me a blessing.

158
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,250
I thought I'd had entered into Nirvana and produced Buddhist relics in my body. (abstained)

159
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,200
I really should have treated the warriors (Korean soccer players) to a meal.

160
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,910
How for six years,

161
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,900
if I took one step, you'd push me back ten.

162
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,800
If I told you that I loved you, you'd say that it would cool soon.

163
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,820
How didn't you visit me at all during my military duty?

164
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,600
Seriously, I wondered how someone could be like that.

165
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,910
To me who had lost my memory,

166
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,220
for coming back to me,

167
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,890
for loving me again,

168
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:53,430
for allowing me to love the man Choi Jin Eon again, just like the first time,

169
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,260
Thank you.

170
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,260
Let's eat. Don't make me talk, I have to eat.

171
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:08,300
It's not because of you, but it's because of me that I'm breaking up with you,

172
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:20,220
so that I can set my life straight even if it's now,

173
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,150
so that I can forgive myself.

174
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,190
There isn't any part of my heart that hates you.

175
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,010
I'm being sincere. So don't blame yourself.

176
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,310
Our parting ways is entirely because of me.

177
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,610
It isn't because of you.

178
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:50,440
And also, I've already parted ways with you.

179
00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:01,550
From the moment my memory returned, I said farewell to you.

180
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,940
Yes. When I checked with the floriography (language of flower) that left on memo,

181
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,690
It's a shrub called oleander, and it can be poisonous.

182
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:41,590
What? That young kid left a poisonous plant at her front door?

183
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:47,390
Yes. There was an actual case that a murder was committed by using this plant.

184
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,130
What, murder?

185
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,080
So, what you're saying is the same guy you saw in the parking garage, right?

186
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,290
Yes, it's the kid who punctured the tire.

187
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:03,360
I was in the process of looking for him anyway.

188
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,700
Find out quickly who he is, what relation he has with her, what he is aiming for.

189
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,730
Yes.

190
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,560
It should be on the CCTV.

191
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,460
Check it out immediately.

192
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,820
Oleander?

193
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,100
The shrub?

194
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,800
Do you know?

195
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:30,090
Since it has 6,000 times stronger toxin than Potassium Cyanide (KCN), it's known as a murder shrub in the foreign countries.

196
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,200
6,000 times?

197
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,030
Because of the poison called Oleandrin, once you ingest it, stomach pain and nervous breakdown occur

198
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,100
and then heart attack occurs.

199
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,060
There were many cases that people died from eating a few of the leaves.

200
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,200
But why suddenly an oleander?

201
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,480
Huh? It's nothing. Finish what you were saying.

202
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,700
According to the documents, someone secretly brought Zolpidem (sleeping pills) to your chief researcher's house.

203
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,290
That was not a thing Do Hae Gang did. That must be done by someone that Chairman ordered.

204
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,190
We have to drag him to our side to be a witness.

205
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:15,010
I met the mother of the deceased Kim Eun Joo and the Korean Chinese person who worked as a maid.

206
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:21,350
They don't know anything about it. They surely believe he became addicted and overdosed on the drug, as the prosecutor stated.

207
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,910
Who was the prosecutor leading it?

208
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,450
Yoon Hak Seong.

209
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,970
Prosecutor Yoon Hak Seong? There are many prosecutors who received the Cheon Nyeon scholarships Chairman Choi offered.

210
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,330
If we check the list of scholarship recipients, we can find out whether he was Chairman Choi's line or not.

211
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:47,350
He drove me out like a mouse, by sticking together with broadcasters, prosecutors, and stockbrokers.

212
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,290
Those bad bastards.

213
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:54,020
Among those who are in positions of power, there isn't a single person who isn't rotten.

214
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,680
There are only good bastards to me.

215
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,050
Is it your story?

216
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,100
Unfortunately, that's the story for all of us.

217
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:14,570
Here are your toothbrush, razor, shaving cream and clothes to change into.

218
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,830
I'll get going.

219
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,110
I think it would be better if I just leave.

220
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,800
Why?

221
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,150
Because I won't want to leave you,

222
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,770
because I'll want to hold you again.

223
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,070
Thanks for dinner. Don't come out.

224
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:47,810
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by<br>the Forgotten Love Team at Viki

225
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,220
Flowers bloom in summer. The floriography is "Danger". Please nurse this healthily and well.

226
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,820
Danger?

227
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,780
What is this?

228
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,480
Oh.

229
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,560
Go inside, I'll go to the police and be back.

230
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,710
The police?

231
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,960
I looked it up and it's a plant that can be really poisonous.

232
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,950
I think someone put it here deliberately to threaten you.

233
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,770
Recently, did something else like this happen?

234
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,480
Tell me the truth.

235
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,780
Hae Gang.

236
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,050
You—

237
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,920
Are you really going to be like this?

238
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,640
Go inside.

239
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,300
Let's go together to the police.

240
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,040
Go inside.

241
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,780
Didn't you hear me? I told you to go inside.

242
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,610
Go inside quickly.

243
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:50,050
So, Shin Il Sang's son is threatening Do Hae Gang?

244
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,500
Yes. His residency is in Sillim-dong.

245
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,820
It seems as if he is working part-time at the gas station on purpose.

246
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,820
Use this punk.

247
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,300
Pardon me?

248
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,150
Even if he was hiding his face, it was probably caught on CCTV.

249
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,250
If you look, it is probably taken in other places besides the gas station.

250
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:12,060
Even if we confirm that he was loitering in the proximity of Do Hae Gang,

251
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,150
if something happens to Do Hae Gang, he'll be a prime suspect.

252
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,850
The next trial and even the trial after that,

253
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,030
a way to prevent Attorney Baek Seok from coming to the courthouse comes across my mind.

254
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,670
Let's use Shin Il Sang's son.

255
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,780
Come and put some toner and lotion on.

256
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,570
Well, here.

257
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,970
Hurry up and put it on, your face will dry out.

258
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:07,140
Okay, I'll put it on for you.

259
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,800
Live how you wish to.

260
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,160
However you want to, do whatever you decide to do.

261
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:28,080
Whatever you choose, or whatever you do from now on, I'll be on your side, and I'll protect you.

262
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,220
So please, if it's difficult, say that's difficult.

263
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,110
If you're scared, then say that you're scared.

264
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,210
And if something happens, I'm saying for you to tell me that something happened.

265
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,300
That hurts.

266
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,800
Oh.

267
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,420
Let me at least do that much in your life.

268
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,080
Even if I can't be your husband, I'll at least do that much.

269
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,090
Just that much, let me into your life just that much. Hmm?

270
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,560
Okay?

271
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,770
Hurry up and put it on.

272
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,210
But are you really going to sleep on the sofa?

273
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:22,080
Yeah, I'm going to sleep on the sofa, so you can't curse me out.

274
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,360
But I don't have a blanket.

275
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,660
I can just cover myself with a coat.

276
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,750
I'll just sleep holding your hand, like a dummy.

277
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,070
For real, you better only hold my hand.

278
00:26:53,300 --> 00:27:01,240
♫ My heart is closed and I'm living like a fool ♫

279
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,190
Why aren't you sleeping? Hurry up and sleep.<br>♫ My heart is closed and I'm living like a fool ♫

280
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,420
♫ Memories of when I loved you ♫

281
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,880
I did wrong.<br>♫ Memories of when I loved you ♫

282
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,950
♫ Are locked deep within the corners of my heart ♫

283
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:22,810
♫ Countless days have passed us by ♫

284
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,560
I did more wrong.<br>♫ Countless days have passed us by ♫

285
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,260
I'm sorry. <br>♫ Countless days have passed us by ♫

286
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,400
I lived only that way.<br> ♫ Just like that day ♫

287
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,390
Come here.<br> ♫ Just like that day ♫

288
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:49,880
♫ Even if we are far apart ♫

289
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,550
♫ Even if everything changes ♫

290
00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:02,040
♫ My heart will withstand time ♫

291
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,340
♫ My heart will withstand time ♫

292
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,930
♫ And it will stay right here  ♫

293
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:41,700
Why don't I see any sight of Dokgo Yong Gi all morning?

294
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,920
"Uh-huh, oof, oof." She keeps sighing,

295
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,630
"Why alcohol, alcohol are you my enemy?"

296
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,300
"My mouth! This mouth behaved in a giddy way!"

297
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:58,420
She keeps saying that. And she gets up and lies back down. She closes her eyes and opens them.

298
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:03,540
Mom must be sick, Professor. She says she isn't hungry.

299
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:16,100
- There isn't any fever.<br>- I said I'm not sick, why do you keep doing that?

300
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,030
Hurry up and go out and eat.

301
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:25,730
It is not a cold. looking at your sinking down, you might come down with a body ache.

302
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:31,000
I said it isn't the body ache. It isn't that, okay?

303
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,480
I said that I'm really not sick.

304
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,170
There isn't any benefit from ignoring your sickness.

305
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,050
This won't do, what good is it not to use a perfectly good doctor.

306
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:43,950
If we ask Professor Min to take a look, he'll be able to know right away where you're sick.

307
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,110
Just wait, I'll go call him.

308
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,650
Oh, no!

309
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:53,800
Wh-wh-wh-why call him? Wh-wh-who are you going to call now?

310
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,960
What's wrong with you? Did something happen with you and Professor Min?

311
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,000
Wh-wh-what happened? Nothing happened!

312
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,090
I'm coming in.

313
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,170
If you're in a condition where you can't even eat, then you can cancel what you said to me.

314
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,080
Wh-wh-wh-what did I say?

315
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,840
I-I-I don't have any memory, I must have blacked out right then.

316
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,830
Did you? I well understand.

317
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:32,300
I fully understand that your drunkenness caused you to cross the line, so come out and eat breakfast.

318
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,200
What? Drunkenness, I crossed the line?

319
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,660
Wait, h-h-how did I cross the line?

320
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,830
"You're fascinating, Professor."

321
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:50,000
"You're amazing, right now." If you weren't sincere, then you've crossed the line with me.

322
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,890
What?

323
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,210
"If only I weren't a mother, I would have gone ker-thump for you."

324
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,530
If you're going to spit out words so sweetly that you aren't going to remember,

325
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:05,110
then you're definitely crossing the line, Dokgo Yong Gi.

326
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:10,270
This is why I dislike alcohol. And I dislike people who can't control their alcohol, even more.

327
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:14,060
People who depend on alcohol, people who run away from things with alcohol, I dislike them all.

328
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,210
So in the end, I dislike Dokgo Yong Gi.

329
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,830
So there isn't any need to cowardly hide from me to avoid me, Dokgo Yong Gi.

330
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,110
Heaven, heaven, my gracious heaven!

331
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,430
 Woo Deum Ji Dumplins

332
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,780
I am a victim of Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals Pudoxin's side effects...

333
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,750
What is it now?

334
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,090
Hey, kid, what is that?

335
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,630
I don't know. It was in Seul Ri's room.

336
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:56,170
I am a victim of Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals Pudoxin's side effects.

337
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,660
Your noona, where is your noona?

338
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,940
In the bathroom.

339
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,850
Give that here.

340
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,520
 Hello, I am Kang Seol Ri, majoring in pharmacy. 4 years ago, I started participating in the clinical trials believing no side effect...

341
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,510
What is this?

342
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,890
To support Oppa with his lawsuit.

343
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,750
If we bring the public opinion, the prosecutors will consider it once more time.

344
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:32,440
So you're going to stand in front of Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals hold this?

345
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,340
Yes.

346
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,260
No way. We can't do this to each other.

347
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,430
We already did too much what we couldn't do to each other.

348
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:42,770
If you hurt others this way, you'll get hurt, too.

349
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,760
This is not an attack, but a self-injury.

350
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,450
I've already thought it through before doing it, so don't worry.

351
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:53,900
My background will help to attract the media's interests.

352
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,210
I won't do it for long.

353
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,430
As soon as I get their attention, I'll stop picketing.

354
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,980
I can keep attacking by doing the interviews.

355
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:11,500
If I stand in front of the company holding this picket sign, will they get hurt like I was, Dad?

356
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,500
Then do it together with me.

357
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,890
You can't do it by yourself, kid.

358
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,560
It has to be a one person protest.

359
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,440
That way I'll be legally protected.

360
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:29,720
If by chance they try to force me off the property, they will be breaking the law.

361
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,510
I don't know if it will turn out like I planned, but I do have a plan.

362
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,280
A plan? What plan?

363
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,210
I saw the allocation of stock.

364
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,460
How could you not give me even one share?

365
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,100
Did you pick me off of the streets?

366
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,800
Am I a stepchild?

367
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,150
You give half of it to Do Hae Gang who doesn't share a drop of blood with you.

368
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,860
How could you do this to me? How?

369
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,160
10.5% is how much money?

370
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,080
So what are you going to give me?

371
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,420
I want to get it in advance.

372
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,610
Give me something ahead of time.

373
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:10,640
Did you leave something with him? What do you keep asking him to hand over?

374
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,710
Without any manners, it seems you don't know your place or your ancestry.

375
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,910
My ancestry?

376
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:19,550
Am I really part of this family's ancestry?

377
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,790
Am I getting treated like this even though I am?

378
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,530
I gave you over 7%, too.

379
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:32,050
If you include your husband's and your children's, more went to you than to Hae Gang.

380
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,550
If Stepmother and Jin Eon combine theirs, it's over 27%, Dad.

381
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:40,670
Why didn't you include the money you took from me without my knowing?

382
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:46,760
Even if I didn't give it to you, I assumed you were taking care of your inheritance on your own.

383
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:52,350
You didn't raise a child, you raised a thief. A thief.

384
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:57,460
They say that the wife follows the husband's lead. How dare you two try to take your father's money?

385
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,670
I don't think we're the only thieves.

386
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,520
Dad also stole from his friend to accumulate his wealth, didn't he?

387
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,310
What?

388
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:13,300
Ssanghwasan. That Ssanghwasan that Do Hae Gang's father developed, you stole it, too, Dad.

389
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,730
Stole? Who says he stole it?

390
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,080
He said he entrusted it to him. He left it to him before he died.

391
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,590
To make sure Ssanghwasan was a success in his place.

392
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,670
Why are you laughing?

393
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:36,020
Because it's the funniest thing I've heard in a long time.

394
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:41,040
You're saying he left a will, aren't you? A will that only father-in-law knows of.

395
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,030
Then you didn't steal from your friend, you protected it.

396
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,060
So you brought up Ssanghwasan according to your friend's wishes.

397
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:55,240
Wow, when did you prepare such a moving story, Father-in-law?

398
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:01,710
Then you shouldn't have registered for a patent transfer the day after your friend died.

399
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,170
That's why I said I took it from him.

400
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,710
Because it's true that I got greedy after hearing my friend's will.

401
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,680
What do you know?

402
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,580
Don't write a novel using a mere sheet of paper. Were you in that place?

403
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,180
I was there. I was.

404
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,880
How dare you? I'm still living.

405
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,880
I didn't die and I'm still alive like this.

406
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,450
Only the dead would know the truth, right, Father-in-law?

407
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:43,360
You believe what you want to. Given the same information,

408
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,100
you believe what you want to. People do.

409
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,070
And also, truth belongs to the living.

410
00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:01,680
Going forward, too, it belongs to those who have to live. Since nobody knows the truth of that day except me,

411
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,260
don't carelessly flap your lips as if you know.

412
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,340
Got it?

413
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,630
These are your father's initial examination charts that I received from the attending physician.

414
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:19,370
Why suddenly this old information, what in the world is it?

415
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:27,270
A stab wound? A 4 cm wound on the back of the left calf.

416
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:30,320
If it was a stab wound...

417
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,360
Does it mean that he was stabbed by a knife?

418
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,780
There's no way to say specifically that it was a knife.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

419
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,570
Since they call it a stab wound whenever someone has been pierced by anything sharp.

420
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:45,450
Seeing that your father couldn't remember where he was stabbed, it doesn't seem to be a knife.

421
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,650
Because I didn't do the initial examination of him and he came to me after his surgery,

422
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,360
I only took a look at it after he got stitched up.

423
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,450
A stab wound doesn't appear in an x-ray.

424
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:02,060
How much must they have struggled to keep from dying?

425
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,070
He was very badly bruised and bleeding.

426
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:11,850
There was a ton of blood on one of his legs. Not on the dead person but the living one.

427
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:12,700
Pardon me?

428
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:17,070
Before deciding that you should live, at least you should live.

429
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:21,670
They probably said, "You die, I can't die."

430
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:29,310
So my father had said he couldn't remember how he was stabbed.

431
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,800
Because he was injured badly in several places.

432
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,350
Or maybe he got stabbed with the knife that was used to cut the rope.

433
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:42,720
He got stabbed and with that knife, he cut the rope.

434
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,270
Thank you for my meal. I will enjoy it.

435
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,460
In prison, I wanted to eat this so badly.

436
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,470
Please have a french fry.

437
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,730
The plan will go into motion very soon.

438
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:14,420
Rumors will be spread to make the stock prices go down and an attempt will be made to buy up all of Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceutical's stocks.

439
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:20,300
So you want me to buy up all the stocks one step ahead? Is that what you're asking?

440
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,100
Yes.

441
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:26,180
But why are you trusting me with that much money?

442
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,980
It isn't you,

443
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,330
but I trust your brilliant criminal records.

444
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:38,350
Tae Jun stock price manipulation case, OPC stock price manipulation case, and Park End stock price manipulation case.

445
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:43,760
Those are the ones you got caught because you failed. There must be a lot of others you were successful in doing without getting caught.

446
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,110
So should I make you take over Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals?

447
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,530
I will worry about taking it over,

448
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:54,490
so you just have to get Cheon Nyeon stocks instead of me.

449
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,380
Hey, what will I get out of it?

450
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,040
I entrusted you with all that money, use your skills and take what you need.

451
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,000
Because it isn't the money but the stocks that I need.

452
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,950
You keep the money that you earn.

453
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,100
Is this for real?

454
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,650
- Yes.<br>- Okay, deal.

455
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,550
Just a moment.

456
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,820
What? Disappeared?

457
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:31,550
I have a copy, so the trial isn't a problem, but the fact that I have it means that you or Yong Gi gave it to me.

458
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,550
What can I do? You've been found out.

459
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,710
There isn't any word? Any kind of hint that you get?

460
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,120
He didn't tell you to get off this lawsuit?

461
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,720
He said it wasn't suicide, but that it was murder.

462
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,510
He told me to protect him.

463
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:52,500
That's why he confessed to killing him.

464
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,430
You're in danger. Min Tae Seok isn't one to sit still and just take it.

465
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:00,110
At the very least, I'm safe until this lawsuit is finished.

466
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:04,520
The problem is you, Seok. I'm not the one in danger, you are.

467
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,570
He's going to do whatever it takes to stop you. He won't let you stand in that courthouse.

468
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,870
I'll be careful that doesn't happen.

469
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:15,060
I'll really be careful this time. I'm sorry.

470
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:22,640
Be careful, Seok. If you get hurt again because of me, then— Then, I'll really—

471
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,810
I won't get hurt. I won't ever get hurt.

472
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,740
No matter what, I'll keep standing in that courthouse.

473
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,050
And then, I'll make sure to win against Attorney Do Hae Gang.

474
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:41,300
I will make sure I put a dent in your 100 percent win record.

475
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,310
I'm hanging up.

476
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,810
Research Journal

477
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,760
Attorney, he's here to install the backup camera.

478
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,790
Ah, yes.

479
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:11,880
What location is good—

480
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,800
I think it would be better not to install a camera, Office Manager.

481
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,340
Excuse me? Wh-why?

482
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:23,400
Then we'll be watching you 24 hours just to catch a thief. We can't do that.

483
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,820
I'm sorry, please just go back.

484
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,340
Then, should we put it outside?

485
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,200
Then do that.

486
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,840
Ah, yes.

487
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,790
Let's go.

488
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:02,990
Do you know our stock price went up ten times more last year because of a new drug Brother-in-law developed in America?

489
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:08,580
Well... Since the stock price keeps ups and downs around ₩700 thousand per share,

490
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,010
10.5% is... My goodness!

491
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,340
You've become rich overnight, Vice Chairman.

492
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,680
Secretary Shin, please prepare some tea.

493
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,800
Yes.

494
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,700
Let's go inside.

495
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:31,810
Please have a seat.

496
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,790
Don't you think the price is absurdly high for the body of hunting dog?

497
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,900
There must be a reason for the absurdly high price, because the money doesn't lie.

498
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,580
Did Brother-in-law not say anything?

499
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,720
He said he had something to say regarding my father and Chairman.

500
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,990
He said to give him two or three days,

501
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:08,410
and that he'd tell me everything without hiding anything, after he confirmed it.

502
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:17,920
As expected, Brother-in-law wouldn't hide everything, deceive everyone, and stab others in the back when given the chance. Different from us?

503
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,480
He's a good person, unlike us.

504
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,950
You should become a good person, unlike me, Attorney Do.

505
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:32,280
If you swallowed my money, ₩5 billion, you should work for me. Isn't it basic manners and business ethics?

506
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:39,800
If you keep playing dumbfounded games against me, keep in mind I'll also play dumbfounded games against you.

507
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,500
You'd better not act thoughtlessly. Just win the lawsuit.

508
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:49,970
If you take care of me through this Pudoxin situation, I'll quietly bury it.

509
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,360
Ah-ha. In two or three days, Brother-in-law will shake up this game.

510
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,290
We'll have to set up your opponent again.

511
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:08,290
Your opponent and your side will change—so will your anger, too,

512
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:12,270
therefore, hastily making me a target of your enemy.

513
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:17,110
So let Chairman Choi strut.

514
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:23,010
Because if Chairman Choi and I become a team, clearing out the likes of you won't take any work.

515
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,480
I've already gotten the experience, too.

516
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:05,490
What are those pictures you have in your hand? It looks like they were taken by CCTV cameras.

517
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,540
They're nothing much.

518
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,650
Really? Go on in.

519
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:30,210
Vice Chairman, R&D President Choi Jin Eon is here.

520
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,710
Please send him in.

521
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,430
Yes.

522
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,800
She said to go on in.

523
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,900
How do I look, Secretary Shin?

524
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,390
Excuse me?

525
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:00,800
Do I look dark? Do I look weighty?

526
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,500
Would you make me laugh?

527
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,160
Excuse me?

528
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,540
Get back to work.

529
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,170
Yes.

530
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,710
You left your watch, did you know?

531
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:26,670
Ah, really? I'll go to get it.

532
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,130
Did you leave it on purpose?

533
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,860
Yeah.

534
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:36,580
I was going to leave socks, but with socks,

535
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,460
I didn't think you'd say, did you know you left socks? So I left my watch.

536
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,500
I'm kidding.

537
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,890
I didn't even know I left my watch behind.

538
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:47,640
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

539
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,090
Just leave it.

540
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:51,850
Why? It's a watch you like.

541
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,100
You can have it.

542
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,250
Thanks,

543
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,790
for giving me something so big I can't even wear it.

544
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:03,340
Why can't you wear it? Wear it on your ankle. Your ankle.

545
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,140
Anyway...

546
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,800
Ah, it's automatic, so you have to feed it every day.

547
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,380
Make sure to feed it well in my place.

548
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,500
I'm going to let it starve.

549
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:19,710
You can let it starve. All it will do is die.

550
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:24,510
Anyhow, your time and my time stopped again.

551
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,090
Why did you come here?

552
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:33,040
Oh, this. These are pictures from the CCTV.

553
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,250
These were taken in front of your house.

554
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:41,060
And these were taken in and around the office parking garage.

555
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:51,600
He's still a kid. We're looking into it, so don't be too scared.

556
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,680
But his clothes,

557
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,900
that day in the parking garage, it looks like the kid who was passing out advertisements.

558
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:11,520
Oh, I'll get going then.

559
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:24,680
Who are you? Who are you that...

560
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:05,810
Family information<br>Son: Shin Kyeong Woo (18 yrs), Preparing GED test, Working part time at Sang Ahm Gas station.

561
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,310
How much should I fill up?

562
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:28,400
- Full.<br>- Yes.

563
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,730
Oh, it's cold!

564
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,920
If you have anything to throw out, please give it to me.

565
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,820
To throw out?

566
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:46,870
Nothing in the car, but in here and here. Would you get it out and throw it away for me?

567
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:54,960
When you're so angry you're going to go crazy, how do you vent?

568
00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:03,700
When you hate someone like crazy, what do I have to do in those cases?

569
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,170
82,000 won.

570
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,070
Kid, don't you have gloves? Work wearing some.

571
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:27,730
Thank you, go safely.

572
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,460
Where is the car wash?

573
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,020
If you go over that way, there's one.

574
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,420
I see.

575
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,290
Goodbye.

576
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:54,190
Young man, catch this.

577
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:01,520
I won't eat this.

578
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,750
I said I wasn't going to eat, seriously!

579
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,570
I'm asking you to open it, kid.

580
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,580
Aren't you going to open it for me? My throat's blocked.

581
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,290
Thanks.

582
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:31,670
On the way of thanking you for helping me, can you hold this, too?

583
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,460
What are you doing now?

584
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:36,050
Are you pick a quarrel with me?

585
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:39,590
I am in the process of trial and error with you.

586
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:45,740
I want to get closer to you, but I don't know how and what to do,

587
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:50,070
so I face up to you recklessly with no particular plan in mind.

588
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,940
What?

589
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,440
I'll be back when I need more gasoline.

590
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,550
Work hard in this cold.

591
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,880
Yes!

592
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:37,000
I am a victim of Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceutical's Pudoxin's side effects.

593
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,130
 Hello, I am Kang Seol Ri, majoring in pharmacy. 4 years ago, I started participating in the clinical trials believing no side effect...

594
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,120
I am a victim of Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceutical's Pudoxin's side effects.

595
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:59,330
You were urgently looking for me?

596
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:04,610
Kang Seol Ri is striking about Pudoxin side effects in front of company right now.

597
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,400
What did you say?

598
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,770
Do you know the reason Kang Seol Ri is doing this is totally because of you?

599
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:11,070
If you feel responsible, get rid of her quickly. Quickly!

600
00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:13,630
What are you doing prior to trials?

601
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,420
If she gets attention from the media, what are you going to do?

602
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:22,530
Drag her right now! Make sure to take necessary action so she won't come again tomorrow, not twice! Surely!

603
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:27,650
Yes. I'll certainly take action.

604
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:39,400
Security team, all of you! Dispatch right now!

605
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,050
Kang Seol Ri.

606
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:48,100
Baek Seok?

607
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,810
Call Baek Seok over here?

608
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:42,860
You are like this. You are pressing with power, threatening, and frightening.

609
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,210
But what can you do?

610
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:48,660
This is the picture I wanted.

611
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,990
Vice Chairman, come out of there.

612
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,150
Hurry, Vice Chairman.

613
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,510
I'm YMEJ reporter Kim Seon Young.

614
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,990
You're Vice Chairman Do Hae Gang of Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals, aren't you?

615
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,280
I'm not doing any interviews.

616
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:21,780
According to Kang Seol Ri, the clinical testing results for Pudoxin were falsified. Is that true?

617
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,160
I said that I wasn't doing any interviews.

618
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,090
- Security Team Leader.<br>- Yes, Vice Chairman.

619
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,070
Delete all the pictures of me from all of these cameras.

620
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,530
I understand.

621
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:33,900
You're prohibited from taking pictures on this side!

622
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,550
Is Pudoxin really...

623
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,410
 Pudoxin clinical trial...

624
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,030
This kid.

625
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:11,920
Where are you going, Attorney?

626
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,930
Attorney?

627
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:47,020
I'm YM Media reporter Kim Si Jin. Would you do an interview with me?

628
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,740
Next Thursday is the second trial.

629
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,420
If you come to the courthouse then, I'll give you an interview.

630
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,340
Next Thursday, what time is the trial?

631
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,480
Thursday afternoon at 4:00 in courtroom 25.

632
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,540
If you come, you'll probably get an exclusive.

633
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,030
Where are you?

634
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,010
I'm nearby.

635
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,850
Nearby where?

636
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:28,990
At the gas station.

637
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:30,590
Are you getting gasoline?

638
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,910
Yeah, but why?

639
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:37,070
 The manager who worked at Bukhan Mountain athe time of the accident has been identified.

640
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:40,270
Name: Kim Ki Seong, Age: 58

641
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,560
Occupation: Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals' chauffeur.

642
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:47,440
I'll put the file on him, on your desk. Come and check it.

643
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,800
What was the name, Hyun Woo?

644
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,220
Name: Kim Ki Seong, Age: 58

645
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:58,670
Occupation: Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals chauffeur

646
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,960
Why aren't you saying anything?

647
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,310
Hey, Choi Jin Eon

648
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,680
Hey, Choi Jin Eon.

649
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:12,600
Send me a picture.

650
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,150
Picture?

651
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:17,210
Okay, I'll send it right away.

652
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:27,160
It won't be.

653
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,360
No, it can't be.

654
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:49,130
Hyun Woo

655
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,580
I'm going to kill you.

656
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:05,780
Yeah, Seok.

657
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:10,230
Right now, to the parking garage?

658
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:14,130
Okay, I'll be right down.

659
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,420
Oh, Seok.

660
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,450
Seok!

661
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:13,470
Seok!

662
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,250
Seok,

663
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,630
Seok.

664
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,680
Wake up.

665
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:29,830
Seok,

666
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,690
Seok. Seok!

667
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:44,440
Wake up. Seok!
