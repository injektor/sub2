<i>Episode 36</i>

00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:20,460
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by<br>the Forgotten Love Team at Viki</i>

3
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,160
Why aren't you asking why I came here?

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,840
Because it appears you aren't here to see me.

5
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,550
Then, whom do you think I came here to meet?

6
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,120
I don't care, so there's no need to tell me.

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,170
It doesn't matter whomever I meet?

8
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,940
As long as it isn't me.

9
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,940
I sent Mido's CEO to you.

10
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,330
I even went to see him at the prison the day he was released.

11
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:08,040
And I sent the fax to Jin Eon.

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,590
Because I thought he should know those awful things that you did.

13
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,130
The counteracting strategy against the lawsuit of the patient infringement of Mi Do Pharmaceuticals,

14
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,990
do you remember now?

15
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,330
That horrible document that you created.

16
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,620
You did unnecessary work again.

17
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,010
He already knows about it.

18
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,410
He had already known about it.

19
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:40,520
I think we'll have to wait and see if it was unnecessary work or not.

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,870
I turned it over to Shin Il Sang, you see.

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,660
-What?<br>-This time I'll become the thorn in your side.

22
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:56,350
I'll become a useless stone that rolls around in those expensive shoes.

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,820
I let everything go.

24
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,320
I let Sunbae go, I let myself go, completely.

25
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,060
Since I have nothing to guard, it's freeing and nice.

26
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,940
Like you said, the two of us aren't finished yet.

27
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,860
I'm not trying to see the end where I get Sunbae.

28
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,550
The end of you and me, whether your wrongdoing or my wrongdoing is bigger.

29
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,900
That's the end that I want to see.

30
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,630
Do Hae Gang, based on how much wrong we did,

31
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,240
let's receive our punishment, okay?

32
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,650
Knock, knock.

33
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,560
I saw you leaving for the day, did you come back?

34
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,280
Yeah, I had a guest.

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,490
-Your guest?<br>-Just left now.

36
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,310
-Please give it to me<br>-No, no, no.

37
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,690
Today accept from me first.

38
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,600
Why? What is it, Brother-in-law?

39
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,500
My father. What is my father

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,410
hiding from me, Brother-in-law?

41
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,840
That climbing accident where two went and only one returned,

42
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,320
is what my father saying all there is?

43
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,150
Brother-in-law,

44
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,830
Only Father-in-law knows the truth.

45
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,280
If he killed his friend,

46
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,190
or if he watched his friend die.

47
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,190
Only Father-in-law knows the truth, Brother-in-law.

48
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,320
However, there is a certain truth that I know.

49
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,010
It's that Father-in-law stole Ssanghwasan that his friend had developed.

50
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,340
The very next day after his friend died.

51
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,530
Whether he really killed Vice Chairman Do Hae Gang's father in the mountain without anyone knowing or not,

52
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:42,420
he did steal and start Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals with Ssanghwasan that Attorney Do's father developed with blood and sweat.

53
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,860
That's how our company started.

54
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,540
Although it is terribly painful, we have to know that way, Brother-in-law.

55
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,930
<i>Did you know about the falsified reports? Did you know but keep your ears and mouth shut?</i>

56
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,390
That's right.

57
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,870
I knew, but kept my ears and mouth shut.

58
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,910
For the company's sake. Because it was for your father's company.

59
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,240
<i>From the opening day of the new year, President Min's subordinates,</i>

60
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,890
<i>cut them out one by one.</i>

61
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:37,790
<i>So, you want to become a hunting dog at Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals, again?</i>

62
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,910
<i>The sin that becomes a part of daily life.</i>

63
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,000
<i>The sin, that you choose and commit on purpose,</i>

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,380
<i>is the heaviest.</i>

65
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,510
Who is it?

66
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,870
Come out. Come out I said.

67
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:48,660
I'll go up against you if you want, so come out. Come out I said!

68
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,780
<i>Even knowing everything,</i>

69
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,340
<i>you were still thinking of starting over with me?</i>

70
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:34,200
<i>There is nothing I can't do for you.</i>

71
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,890
<i>Whether you permit me to or not,</i>

72
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,340
<i>there is only your decision left.</i>

73
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,020
<i>How is that possible?</i>

74
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,260
What is this, without any notice?

75
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,960
I needed a drinking buddy.

76
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,470
Really? There's a drinker here, so have a seat.

77
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,860
Is your forehead okay?

78
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,890
You weren't worried about me, but you came because you were worried about him, didn't you?

79
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,370
-Sorry<br>-You're not sorry.

80
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,490
Just hand over the beer. I was in the middle of thinking if I needed to go buy some when it's so cold out.

81
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,990
Here.

82
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,100
Since we don't talk about work, there's nothing to talk about, right?

83
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,300
If there's nothing to say, then let's just drink beer. Here, cheers.

84
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,210
Why don't you ask me what I did today?

85
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,690
What did you do today?

86
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,000
I went to get some air at Imjingang Station.

87
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,620
Yeah?

88
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,840
If you get frustrated, go there, too. It helps clear your eyes and head.

89
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,410
I was getting frustrated myself, that's good. I'll make sure to go tomorrow.

90
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,670
Don't just drink, eat something, too.

91
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,360
I'm fine.

92
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,030
If you eat that, I'll return the Pancillate Monodiplan to you.

93
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,230
What did you just say?

94
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:14,330
I said if you deliciously eat a piece of pufferfish I gave you, I'll return the medicine that Cheon Nyeon took from you.

95
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,300
Why?

96
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,430
Are you trying to kill me with the pufferfish poison?

97
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,240
It's said that the Tetrodotoxin from one pufferfish can kill more than 30 people.

98
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,820
Do you know one of the pharmaceuticals in Japan is developing the pain medicine from this pufferfish poison?

99
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,520
If you use the poison well, you can turn it to the medicine.

100
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:44,300
Have some. It'll make the pain, you are suffering right now, disappear.

101
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,060
Don't beat around the bush. Just get to your point.

102
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,020
What do you want from me?

103
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:05,600
I have to know what game this is, to decide if I'm in or out.

104
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,730
Please put Do Hae Gang and Chairman Choi Man Ho in jail.

105
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,050
Someone, that is holding my flaw, asked me to ruin Do Hae Gang.

106
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,430
When I thought about it, if I held hands with you,

107
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,630
I realized I could get Chairman Choi Man Ho as well at the same time.

108
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,030
Do Hae Gang is just a hunting dog.

109
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:34,750
It was Do Hae Gang who grabbed Mi Do Pharmaceuticals but the person who swallowed it was Chairman Choi Man Ho.

110
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:41,640
On the outside, it looks like Do Hae Gang did, but isn't Chairman the one who orchestrated it from behind?

111
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,480
Is there a prosecutor you know? I'll go to the prosecutor tomorrow.

112
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,750
It's useless you send the anonymous letters even 100 times.

113
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:55,380
I can introduce you to a prosecutor anytime. Just start by getting evidence that Choi Man Ho was behind it.

114
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,020
From the Mi Do Pharmaceuticals researchers who took money from Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals,

115
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:03,200
or from the patient examiners, you try to make any witness.

116
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,510
You also listen to the story of the researcher side, who committed suicide by jumping from the building.

117
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:11,380
Weren't those employees that you spent decades with, like family?

118
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:17,590
I'm sure they run out of the money they got. And if they have a conscience, give them a chance to use that conscience.

119
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,100
I will support you more than enough.

120
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,150
Put Do Hae Gang and Choi Man Ho in jail?

121
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,390
I'll get Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals and you'll get your medicine back.

122
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,290
And someone else will get revenge on Do Hae Gang.

123
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,600
And another someone else will self-destruct because of Do Hae Gang and Choi Man Ho.

124
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,960
<i>Cha Do Murder!</i> It means to borrow someone else's sword and kill the enemy. It comes from <i>The Art of War</i>.

125
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,400
Thanks to you, it looks like I'll be wiping my nose without lifting a finger.

126
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:05,700
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by<br>the Forgotten Love Team at Viki</i>

127
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,470
<i>Today. Just today.</i>

128
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,830
<i>Because it's Christmas.</i>

129
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,520
<i>I don't like it.</i>

130
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,540
<i>Because Christmas comes every year.</i>

131
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,540
<i>Because they exist until I die.</i>

132
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,340
<i>I don't like being like this only today.</i>

133
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,500
You lost again. How can you lose every day?

134
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,000
Hey, if you lose the lawsuit.

135
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,150
I won't lose. I won't ever lose.

136
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,130
Even if I lose to drinking, I'll never lose the lawsuit.

137
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,810
Why? Because I'm your hope.

138
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,040
Right?

139
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,180
Yeah, you're my hope. Baek Seok is my hope.

140
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:54,150
My feet are comfortable, my eyes are comfortable, and my heart is comfortable.

141
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:57,450
It seems your heart is very uncomfortable today.

142
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,720
I'm really comfortable right now.

143
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,310
You're really not comfortable right now.

144
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,600
Why do you think?

145
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,800
It's because you're not doing your punishment.

146
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,020
Stop dragging it out, and hurry up and do it. Quickly.

147
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,400
What's my punishment? Go out like this in the cold?

148
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,990
Well, I'll let it go with a song.

149
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,660
Sing me a song. Here, mic.

150
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:36,310

00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,280

196
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,530
Why is it so quiet? Did everyone go somewhere?

197
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,070
To go sledding.

198
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,980
Huh? By themselves?

199
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,540
There's a tiny one that opened nearby.

200
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:20,500
To make a little of money from kids, they put a few of red plastic basins as sleds and sell the snacks.

201
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,320
It's break, should we take the kids somewhere nearby?

202
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,510
Even if we can't take them on oversea trips like others, if we let them free in the hot springs, they will have fun playing all day long.

203
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:35,380
I'll schedule something and take them, you just concentrate on the trial. I can't sleep.

204
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,860
I am disgusted and losing my temper.

205
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,700
It's the <1% that's ruining this world.

206
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,200
They don't have any conscience nor common sense.

207
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,200
They have just a full of greed.

208
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,800
Even though they had 10, they wanted to have 11.

209
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,000
How did they do such a crazy thing? Heavens!

210
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,940
There's no end to a person's greed.

211
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:04,640
Hey kid, by you acknowledging it like that, they, with the endless greed, don't know how the people are scary.

212
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,600
And also, how can you say they are human beings? They're animals!

213
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:15,560
No, the animals who hear that would get upset. Animals only take what they need for their existence.

214
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:22,460
They don't make storage bins or sheds to store the carcass up to rot.

215
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:27,720
Wow, our father is really angry. I get it, I'll make sure to win.

216
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,860
I have to win, Father. I promised that I would win.

217
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,740
With whom?

218
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:40,360
Someone. To someone who wants me to win more than anyone.

219
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Are you going to have the first trial, today?

220
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,960
Yeah.

221
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,420
How are you going to win? Do you have a way to win?

222
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,560
Lawsuits involving drug side effects are hard to win even in the U.S. How are you going to prove the side effects?

223
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,410
Even though there are the supporting research papers, those are only a few.

224
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,590
If I go with the legal principle way, I'll lose 100%.

225
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:08,590
We have to fight using unequivocal witnesses or evidence.

226
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:12,050
Unequivocal witnesses or evidence?

227
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,860
<i>What are you going to do if Dokgo Yong Gi's memory returns?</i>

228
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:28,270
<i>Fabricating Pudoxin's clinical test results, Kim Sun Yong's death, and even the video you made! That wench knows everything! She knows about everything!</i>

229
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,210
<i>The last person Do Hae Gang met before she died was that wench, Dokgo Yong Gi!</i>

230
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,400
<i>I'm coming in!</i>

231
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,920
Oh, come in, Oppa!

232
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,540
What did the doctor say about the tests?

233
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:53,750
"Our bone is composed of cortical bone (compact bone) at the outer surface and cancellous bone (trabecular or spongy bone) at the inner layer, Patient."

234
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:03,400
"<i> In your situation</i>... Hmm... the cortical bone has dramatically gotten thin compared to the regular people."

235
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:10,670
"Even if the bone fracture happens at any time,... Hmm, hmm... <i> we won't consider it's a strange case at all."</i>

236
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,600
It's the first time I realized the word of <i>the regular people</i> is so important.

237
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,500
I have been striving to become a special one for 29 years.

238
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
My striving is useless now.

239
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,220
What about medicine?

240
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,320
For now, I just got a prescription for the oral calcium.

241
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,280
Saying they'll prescribe the proper medicine once the cause is discovered.

242
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,970
Although, I already know the cause.

243
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,540
Seol Ri, get treated and be careful,

244
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,710
and confidently take each day by day.

245
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,280
So you don't fall physically or mentally,

246
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,020
I'll always hold onto your hand tightly.

247
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,500
And with your other hand, you'll hold Do Hae Gang's hand?

248
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,160
What?

249
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:27,550
Between Do Hae Gang and me, if you have to let go of one hand, whose hand will you let go?

250
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:38,270
Think carefully starting today, if you'll let go of my hand or of Do Hae Gang's hand.

251
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,840
Seol Ri,

252
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:47,840
If the three of us were standing at the edge of a cliff,

253
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,350
think about whose hand you would let go of to have fall off the cliff.

254
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:59,970
What nonsense? I wouldn't bring you to a cliff in the first place. I'd take you to the prairie.

255
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:06,110
Do well today. Don't be pushed down or shoved by Do Hae Gang.

256
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,330
You must get a head start from the beginning. Understand?

257
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,470
What? Jin Eon knew about it?

258
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,470
Yeah, he asked so I told him.

259
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,230
Why is it so quiet then? Is a bomb about to explode or what?

260
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:32,220
He isn't going to start moving after just my words. He'll probably start by trying to confirm it.

261
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,420
How will he confirm something from over thirty years ago?

262
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,200
I don't know about Do Hae Gang's father's death,

263
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,100
but about Ssanghwasan, if you just check its patent registration through the internet,

264
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,380
you'll be able to know right away that Father-in-law stole it.

265
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,450
He'll probably go crazy. It'll probably make him jump up and down going crazy.

266
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,640
With Brother-in-law's personality, he'll probably want to die.

267
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,490
Or to kill him.

268
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:04,680
What a life his is! This is not about a suffering life with Do Hae Gang.

269
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,860
A life with full of ups and owns! A life that went until gone! How come his tragedy doesn't end?

270
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,160
That is because he has a good father.

271
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,640
The price he was born with holding several 100 billion won worth of the gold flatware!

272
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:21,600
You can be happy with a few of tens thousand won but you have a lot of tragedy with several 10 or 100 billion won.

273
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,910
How will Jin Eon act now, Honey?

274
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:31,630
He'll either destruct himself alone or destruct with Father-in-law together.

275
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,840
Well, it's probably either one of those.

276
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,700
<i> Master Register Issued Patent</i>

277
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,510
<i>Owner of Registration: Dokgo Ji Hoon</i>

278
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,310
<i>Registered May 10, 1981</i>

279
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:49,250
<i>Transferred to Choi Man Ho on May 16, 1981</i>

280
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,770
<i>It means he stole Ssanghwasan that his friend had developed.</i>

281
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:57,410
<i>The very next day after his friend died.</i>

282
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,690
<i>Based on a witness statement of the latter climber falling as the rope breaking down, the police is investigating the exact cause...</i>

283
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:22,670
Gosh, this world, we can buy the tickets just sitting here.

284
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:27,000
That's right. We can even select our seats.

285
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,080
It's worth living long to see, no matter what.

286
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,560
Let's see.

287
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,850
Oh, how about <i>Himalayas</i>. Hwang Jung Min appears in it.

288
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,510
Let's watch <i> Inside Men</i>. Lee Byung Hun and Jo Seung Woo appear.

289
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,840
I like Hwang Jung Min better.

290
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,770
What is it about?

291
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,880
<i>What is this? To find his colleague's corpse, who died in an accident during climbing,</i>

292
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,090
<i>they start a new life of journey risking their own life...</i>

293
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,800
That's enough. I don't like it because it reminds me of your close childhood friend.

294
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,160
How does the subject leap to that way?

295
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,960
I want to finally see a movie with you after thirty, forty years.

296
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,500
That's what I mean, we are finally watching a movie after thirty, forty years,

297
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,060
I don't want to watch it thinking of Hae Gang's father.

298
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:17,060
You say that now, but while watching the movie, I'm sure you'll think of your friend who died in the mountains.

299
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,720
What is that? To go ruin your mood at a theater.

300
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,260
I didn't think about that.

301
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,860
Until you mentioned it,

302
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,120
I didn't think about it.

303
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,560
Watch that movie with me, Father.

304
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,580
And watch a movie that Mom wants to see today.

305
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,000
What? You're going to watch a movie with your dad? You?

306
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,940
I'll check the schedule and buy the tickets.

307
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,200
Oh, okay.

308
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,780
Then, I'll be back.

309
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,000
I'll be back.

310
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,640
Okay, drive carefully.

311
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:53,040
That's why I told you to use a driver, it worries me.

312
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,200
I'll be careful. I'll call you later, so come out around the time of my getting off work.

313
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,560
Go on a date with your son.

314
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,740
Today? I can't today, the advertiseme... oh.

315
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,200
I have plans.

316
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,860
Really? Then let's go another day.

317
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,880
Okay. Hey, Son. Keep your word.

318
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,220
If you stand me up, you're dead.

319
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,300
Okay, I'll be back. Bye.

320
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,220
The other tires were fine, so i just changed the left front.

Your car key.

322
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,280
-Thank you.<br>-Take care.

323
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,400
Don't put one on my car.

324
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,760
You should greet me.

325
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,400
How can you hold your head upright after seeing a superior?

326
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,840
Of course, I am and it's better we keep business and private matters strictly apart.

327
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Why are you looking agai...

328
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,240
I'll go in first.

329
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:52,520
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by<br>the Forgotten Love Team at Viki</i>

330
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,200
Is something the matter?

331
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,200
What's wrong? What is it?

332
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,480
Something bad happened, didn't it?

333
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,340
What is it that... tell me, hurry.

334
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,260
Should we go live abroad?

335
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,160
What did you say?

336
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,060
Far away. As far away as possible, just the two of us.

337
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:33,200
Galapagos, yeah, let's go live there.

338
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,720
There are many more turtles and iguanas there than people.

339
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,380
We can stay in island and then buy a yacht and go out on the sea sometimes and eat and sleep,

340
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,240
dolphins and sea turtles will pass by in front of us.

341
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,620
Do you want to go?

342
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,180
What's wrong?

343
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,780
What is it? Huh?

344
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,780
I'll make you happy.

345
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,860
Happy every single day, happy every moment.

346
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,580
Let's go, Hae Gang. Let's leave.

347
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,000
Let's first go to work, go up and work.

348
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Let's talk after work whatever it's about.

349
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,440
Let's go upstairs.

350
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:25,200
♫ <i> Even though you love me and love me more </i> ♫

351
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:33,200

352

354
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,780
Which courtroom is it at 3:00?

355
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,500
Oh, courtroom 15.

356
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,100
Are you planning to come?

357
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,100
It'll make you uneasy if you watch, will you be alright?

358
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,620
Why? Because of the other side's attorney?

359
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,800
If nothing else, I want to hear what she has to say,

360
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,000
I want to hear clearly what she has to say, that's why I want to go.

361
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,240
What is she going to flap her lips about with the opened mouth?

362
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,200
Okay, you're going to be a witness anyway, so come watch.

363
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,320
But don't forget that what you see isn't all there is.

364
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,780
I'm going to do whatever it takes

365
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,460
to get the journal and memos from her and give them to you.

366
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,900
If you only had the memos that he left, you'll be able to win this case.

367
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,920
I have the memos and the journal.

368
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,400
What?

369
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,380
I have a copy of the journal and the originals of the memos.

370
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,620
Wait, how did those...?

371
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,260
That's what I mean, how would I have those?

372
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,420
You can't ever say anything about those memos, Yong Gi. Nobody can know about those.

373
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,440
Oh, I understand.

374
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,680
Ong Gi is lonely fighting by herself as a lawyer Do Hae Gang right now.

375
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,770
<i>For your sake. To set things right.</i>

376
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,530
I can't, so come cheer her on.

377
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,970
Why aren't you opening it, I'm freezing to death.

378
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:33,890
Isn't anyone there? Open up, quickly! Hurry!

379
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,850
Oh my, you came?

380
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:00,000
I was in the middle of making handcut noodles, so my appearance is a bit...

381
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,760
First, come sit, over here.

382
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,370
Let's sit together, as I have something to say to you.

383
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,840
Then please go to the kitchen.

384
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:19,220
I have to feed our Kyu Seok at 12:00 so I don't have a moment to sit.

385
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,170
It's his day off so I have to take care of three meals. Really.

386
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,900
Wh-what? Kyu Seok?

387
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,970
Who are you calling your Kyu Seok? Who are you calling Kyu Seok?

388
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:33,550
Are you out of your mind? Can't you really distinguish between heaven and earth?

389
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,700
By any chance, do you have an anger disorder?

390
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,630
Oh my gosh, why are you so angry?

391
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:46,480
I see, I'll call him Doctor. Then will that make you feel a little better?

392
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,710
Wh-wh-wh-what?

393
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:50,910
I'll just go finish what I was doing. Breathe deeply.

394
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,770
Doctor.

395
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,570
Can't we do that date thing again?

396
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,920
Woo Joo, are you being angry with me right now?

397
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,810
Why? What is making you angry?

398
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:31,830
Doctor is not looking at me and only looking at books,

399
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,300
so it makes me feel mad.

400
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,320
In any case, I can't just look at your face all day long.

401
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,300
Do you like books that much?

402
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,070
That's true. I like books.

403
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,800
Do you like them more than me?

404
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,130
About ten of them.

405
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:58,910
There are about ten books that I like more than you.

406
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,880
But out of people, I like you the best.

407
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,070
Are you disappointed in me?

408
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,200
If you're that disappointed and angry,

409
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,060
then find ten books that you like more than me.

410
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,690
Then our hearts will become alike in what we like.

411
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,920
Would you go to the bookstore with me?

412
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,390
Let's go. To buy ten books that you like more than me.

413
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,010
So, you don't have any thoughts of ending or breaking up?

414
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,500
No.

415
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,720
But, would you like some handcut noodles before you go?

416
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,620
If you would like to eat, I'll have to make some more dough, you see.

417
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,920
You're a child's mother.

418
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,580
Ah. We'll just eat then.

419
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,910
You're a single mother, you are. Know your place, your place.

420
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,490
Is that all?

421
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,790
Your daughter is an incurable disease patient.

422
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:57,930
A patient who can't be cured even if she's treated her whole life.

423
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:03,020
How could you bring such a child to our brother-in-law... Does that make sense to you?

424
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:07,190
Your daughter's illness, you should know it's genetic.

425
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:13,320
I don't know if you gave her the illness or her father did, but don't bring it into our house.

426
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:22,550
Whether it makes sense or not, I'll show you by living it out, Sister-in-law.

427
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:26,220
Wh-wh-what? Sister-in-law?

428
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,750
How do you get off...

429
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,150
Say it again. Say it again.

430
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,580
Excuse me?

431
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,770
-Sister-in-law!<br>-Ahh!

432
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:38,070
I'll live nicely, Sister-in-law.

433
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:46,280
As nicely as you and Brother-in-law worry about it, more nicely and more happily, we'll live.

434
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,610
Sister-in-law, I know I can do it.

435
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,650
As you say,

436
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:57,730
I'm a child's mother, a single mother, and my child is sick.

437
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,820
But if our Kyu Seok likes me,

438
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,570
how can I refuse him in my situation?

439
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,820
I'll have to make an effort and grab hold of it.

440
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:10,830
I will really do well, Sister-in-law.

441
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,580
Sister-in-law!

442
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,340
B-b-brother-in-law.

443
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,360
Make the dough again.

444
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,230
Make the dough again so the three of us can eat handcut noodles!

445
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:29,940
What are you doing? Make the dough again, Sister-in-law.

446
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,420
You can't step one foot outside until you make us new handcut noodles to eat.

447
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,910
Wh-wh-what did you say?

448
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:42,410
Here's the flour and water. And plastic gloves.

449
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:48,380
Put the flour and the water and make the dough nice and chewy!

450
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,200
Sister-in-law!

451
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,000
What is this? That person, why is she doing that in my kitchen?

452
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,130
That's what I mean.

453
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:40,140
She must really be afraid of her younger brother-in-law.

454
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,410
Restructuring?

455
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:57,610
Are you preparing restructuring without my knowledge?

456
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,490
Chairman ordered it.

457
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:08,620
He and Vice Chairman, excluding the company representative, only two made a decision that would stir a whole group?

458
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,800
Chairman decided it on his own. I only received the orders.

459
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,560
He tries to alienate you and me to each other.

460
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:21,790
He is really cunning. He meant to not make you and me the same side.

461
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,940
In any case,

462
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,790
it looks like you're going to hear the weeping sound as soon as you're seated. Will you be okay?

463
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:35,540
From the beginning of new year, if restructuring is heard, besides the employee will resist, it'll affect the stock price.

464
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,350
Let's hold a funeral (restructuring) when the weather is warm, Vice Chairman Do.

465
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,100
No,

466
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,150
The restructuring isn't of the employees, it's of the management.

467
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,390
What did you say?

468
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,500
Who is getting cut?

469
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,640
When you go to funerals, you don't only hear mourning.

470
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,230
Only the bereaved are sad,

471
00:48:54,230 --> 00:49:00,190
the visitors are laughing and noisy all night. And they relieve stress.

472
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:06,460
I'm only going to go after the fat pigs that took tons of money for years without doing anything.

473
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,850
So the employees will welcome it.

474
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:11,460
Fat pigs?

475
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,440
Here is the fat pigs list.

476
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,790
<i>The Subjects of Managements for Restructuring at Cheon Nyeon Pharmaceuticals </i>

477
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:24,110
<i>List of the subjects of management for restructuring</i>

478
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:26,850
<i>Kim Hwak Soo, Strategic Deputy Chief Director.</i>

479
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:32,330
During past 3 years, he paid out ₩ 8 billion and 80 million as a rebate fee to Jae Yee Hospital.

480
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:36,490
He received ₩ 4 billion back out of that money. Do you know about it?

481
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,760
What is it?

482
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,730
It seems you knew about it.

483
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,910
Did you share it together? Oh.

484
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:49,440
You should have used some discretion.

485
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,950
There is an information from the prosecutor's office that the scandal-ridden rebate is under investigation.

486
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:58,580
Cut Strategic Deputy Chief Director Kim Hwak Soo, the tail, quickly.

487
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,470
Pointlessly being connected with him, don't get blown away harshly together.

488
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,950
Then, after taking time to look over it, let's turn it up.

489
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:12,320
You'd better know I absolutely can't compromise the person who has already been caught of involving in the scandal.

490
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,830
I have a trial, so.

00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,800
Ah, I saw Dad.

00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,750
What?

549
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:06,880
<i>In a picture. Your father-in-law showed me a picture they took together.</i>

550
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,940
<i>But he's uglier than I thought.</i>

551
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:13,450
<i>But, he did look like a good person.</i>

552
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:19,750
You don't know dad's face either, do you? Ask your father-in-law to show you the picture.

553
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,590
I will.

554
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:25,280
<i>He said that Dad had cut the rope.</i>

555
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,860
What? It wasn't broken by itself?

556
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:35,380
It looked like the two of them were going to die together, so I guess Dad cut it first.

557
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,710
<i>Isn't our dad quite amazing?</i>

558
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,810
Our Dokgo Ji Hoon was really a man's man, hmm?

559
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:47,170
Dokgo Ji Hoon?

560
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:51,090
Our dad's name was Dokgo Ji Hoon?

561
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:55,560
Hey, you didn't even know that this whole time?

562
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,730
<i>I suppose, you probably didn't have any opportunity to.</i>

563
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:08,150
This is the first time hearing it, but why does it sound familiar?

564
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:10,810
Dokgo Ji Hoon isn't even that common.

565
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:12,940
It must be because he's our dad.

566
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:17,280
Your heart must have connected with him before your ears did.

567
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,520
No,

568
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,390

569
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,710
<i>The two of them are definitely working together.</i>

- I'll be back.<br>- Please be back.

575
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:36,900
At the defendant's company, the sales record for Pudoxin, the treatment for gastritis

576
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:42,240
is presently in first place, taking 45% of shares in the market.

577
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:47,160
That's not all. In the first year of sales, in 2010, it reached ₩10 billion in sales.

578
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:52,340
Just last year, it earned ₩ 95 billion from the domestic sales.

579
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:55,820
It is in the process of being sold to the Chinese market.

580
00:57:55,820 --> 00:58:00,230
It has been taken by many people already and there will be more people in the future,

581
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:04,260
who will take this problematic drug without any warning

582
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,150
or caution.

583
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,550
Ah, yes, I understand.

584
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,820
I asked the court to please look at Exhibit P-1,

585
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,720
Exhibit P-2, and Exhibit P-3.

586
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,140
As you can see, these are Moon Tae Joon's X-rays.

587
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,780
Exhibit P-2 is that in May of 2014,

588
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,380
while he was getting off a bus,

589
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:58,070
falling down suddenly, and being diagnosed that he had fractures, the picture of X-ray he got at that time.

590
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:01,240
Now, the photo from Exhibit 3 and

591
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,130
the health report he received in July of 2010,

592
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,930
I ask the court to please have a look at them alongside.

593
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:10,380
Before takng Pudoxin, Mr. Moon Tae Joon's bone density

594
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,070
showed no problems whatsoever.<br> <i>Bone density: Normal</i>

595
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:18,140
Other than having gastritis, he was in good health.

596
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:23,700
<i>The PII component that's used in Pudoxin,</i>

597
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,900
<i>if taken long-term, it loses acidity and prevents the absorption of calcium</i>

598
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,970
<i>and raises the thyroid hormone,</i>

599
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:33,610
<i>and due to osteoclast, the bone density level declines,</i>

600
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:36,420
<i>and the chances of having bone fracture is elevated.</i>

601
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,370
<i>According to a doctor from Johns Hopkins-</i>

602
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:41,890

603
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:43,770
<i>compared to those who aren't-</i>

604
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:47,120
<i>Weren't things over between you and Vice Chairman Do Hae Gang?</i>

605
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:52,820
Brother-in-law, who are you rooting for?

606
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,570
The plaintiff's weight was 102kg.

607
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,630
He's last recorded weight was 61kg.

608
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:21,200
Rapid weight loss very well can be the cause of bone fracture.

609
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,800
But why did the plaintiff's attorney leave this fact out,

610
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:29,480
and trying to blame a national pharmaceutical company with side-effects from a drug that can't even be proven,

611
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,660
I don't understand why he's looking for reasons

612
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:36,520
to pin the blame for the bone fractures.

613
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,840
And that's not all. The plaintiff was not taking only Pudoxin.

614
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:44,480
But also, he always took Colloid Gelcaps and the similar medicines.

615
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,590
If the deceased's multiple fracture,

616
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:50,560
If this is the side effects of the medication as the plaintiff's attorney claims,

617
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:54,820
He should bring up the issue of the other medicines' side effects in the same way, as well.

618
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,910
Please take a look at Exhibit Ds, Judges.

619
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:02,320
The plaintiff's father, Moon Kyeong Tae

620
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:08,120
had suffered from Rheumatoid Arthritis and died from complication of the heart failure.

621
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:12,320
Also, the plaintiff's second older brother is presently

622
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,860
diagnosed with Reumatoid Arthritis and taking the medications.

623
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:20,500
This rheumatoid arthritis is that the excessive inflammatory mediators produced in the body

624
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,870
affects the metabolism in the bone. So due to pain, an abstacle of body movement and

625
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:30,080
the reduced activity seriously affect on reducing the bone density.

626
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,400
Moreover, according to the research reports, 60% of the cause of the rheumatoid arthritis developing,

627
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,290
is from a genetic factor.

628
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:41,380
Therefore, the cause of Moon Tae Joon's multiple fracture is not from Pudoxin.

629
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:46,620
It's a common sense and a logical and rational thought if we look at the family genetics for the cause of it.
