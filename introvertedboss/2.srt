00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

3
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,720
<font color=#FFFF00>I apologize.</font>

00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,190
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

7
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,690
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm sorry!

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,320
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have mustered up my courage earlier.</font>

11
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I hesitated for too long and lost my chance.</font>

12
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is she now?</font>

13
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did she quit all of a sudden?</font>

14
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,020
<font color=#FFFF00>- My goodness.
- What about Mr. Smith?</font>

15
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,320
<font color=#FFFF00>You reek of alcohol.</font>

16
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here? Did you get fired already?</font>

17
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,720
<font color=#FFFF00>I did see this coming.</font>

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Mr. Smith come here or not?</font>

19
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,420
<font color=#FFFF00>He just left. Didn't you see him?</font>

20
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Ro Woon!</font>

21
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you Mr. Smith?</font>

22
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,350
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Chae Ro Woon.</font>

23
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,520
<font color=#FFFF00>These flowers are for me, right?</font>

24
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Well, it's...</font>

25
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,620
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm... I'm your...</font>

26
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Mr. Smith?</font>

27
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,590
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who?
- Mr. Smith.</font>

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,420
<font color=#FFFF00>The person who sent me this bouquet.</font>

29
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,150
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who is it?
- Well, the thing is...</font>

30
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,920
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually, I...</font>

31
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,520
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you can't tell me even if I ask. I know that.</font>

32
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,020
<font color=#FFFF00>However, I must find out today.</font>

33
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,490
<font color=#FFFF00>What kind of person is he? Tell me.</font>

34
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is he?</font>

35
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Move the bouquet.</font>

36
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,090
<font color=#FFFF00>What is he like?</font>

37
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,790
<font color=#FFFF00>I said, what is he like?</font>

38
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Won't you tell me?</font>

39
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,220
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't go until you tell me.</font>

40
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,020
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

41
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop!</font>

42
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,750
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to meet him!</font>

43
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,890
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because today's the last day.</font>

44
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,020
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to meet him since today's the final show.</font>

45
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take me to Mr. Smith. Please?</font>

46
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Please?</font>

47
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,360
<font color=#FFFF00>If you can't take me to him,</font>

48
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,590
<font color=#FFFF00>at least give him this message.</font>

49
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell him that I thank him so much for everything.</font>

50
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to Mr. Smith, I was able to go through hard times.</font>

51
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Got it?</font>

52
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Please forward my message.</font>

53
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,720
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get going then.</font>

54
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I ask you one thing?</font>

55
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,490
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you know I didn't leave?</font>

56
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead.</font>

57
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you suddenly leaving the stage?</font>

58
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,220
<font color=#FFFF00>That's a secret...</font>

59
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,890
<font color=#FFFF00>even for Mr. Smith.</font>

60
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you keep calling him Mr. Smith?</font>

61
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,420
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

62
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,890
<font color=#FFFF00>- We weren't eavesdropping.
- Let's go.</font>

63
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,520
<font color=#FFFF00>That's the alias Daddy-long-legs used.</font>

64
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,950
<font color=#FFFF00>John Smith.</font>

65
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,350
<font color=#FFFF00>My older sister...</font>

66
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,390
<font color=#FFFF00>committed suicide three years ago.</font>

67
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,120
<font color=#FFFF00>My sister used to always send me...</font>

68
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,720
<font color=#FFFF00>bouquets whenever I performed.</font>

69
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Although...</font>

70
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,650
<font color=#FFFF00>she was no longer in this world,</font>

71
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,850
<font color=#FFFF00>I kept getting flowers.</font>

72
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,320
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt like she was still alive.</font>

73
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Smith...</font>

74
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,750
<font color=#FFFF00>must be my sister's friend...</font>

75
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,520
<font color=#FFFF00>or her past lover.</font>

76
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,820
<font color=#FFFF00>Or perhaps...</font>

77
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you still there?</font>

78
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really want to know who he is?</font>

79
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't tell me.</font>

80
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,650
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually, I want to know,</font>

81
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,150
<font color=#FFFF00>but I also don't.</font>

82
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,050
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to remain curious and let it make my heart flutter.</font>

83
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,590
<font color=#FFFF00>I can imagine all I want.</font>

84
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if my sister isn't around, I'll act like she is.</font>

85
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,820
<font color=#FFFF00>I never told this anyone.</font>

86
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,650
<font color=#FFFF00>How did I end up telling it in a smelly washroom?</font>

87
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,720
<font color=#FFFF00>And the men's washroom at that.</font>

88
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,690
<font color=#FFFF00>On top of that, I told someone that's super quiet.</font>

89
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,050
<font color=#FFFF00>"Are you all right?"</font>

90
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,120
<font color=#FFFF00>"It must have been tough."</font>

91
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,890
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't even know how to console someone like that.</font>

92
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,850
<font color=#FFFF00>My sister was just like you.</font>

93
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,990
<font color=#FFFF00>She had her mouth shut like a clam.</font>

94
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir,</font>

95
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,620
<font color=#FFFF00>is there something you want to say to me?</font>

96
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,120
<font color=#FFFF00>She should have said so if she was suffering.</font>

97
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,190
<font color=#FFFF00>She was hurting so much,</font>

98
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,690
<font color=#FFFF00>yet I didn't hear a peep from her.</font>

99
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,690
<font color=#FFFF00>In the last three years,</font>

100
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,520
<font color=#FFFF00>that was the hardest part of all.</font>

101
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Not knowing...</font>

102
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,460
<font color=#FFFF00>why my sister died.</font>

103
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,120
<font color=#FFFF00>I was right beside her.</font>

104
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,890
<font color=#FFFF00>We even shared a room.</font>

105
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't she tell me?</font>

106
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,020
<font color=#FFFF00>I wish she had just said...</font>

107
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,250
<font color=#FFFF00>something.</font>

108
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,550
<font color=#FFFF00>I must tell her...</font>

109
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,990
<font color=#FFFF00>so that the tragedy doesn't repeat itself.</font>

110
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,490
<font color=#FFFF00>- Put pressure on it.
- Okay.</font>

111
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,790
<font color=#FFFF00>All done.</font>

112
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

113
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me, where is patient Kim Gyo Ri?</font>

114
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Over here.</font>

115
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Eun?</font>

116
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I hearing things now?</font>

117
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Kim.</font>

118
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,690
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me, Eun Hwan Gi.</font>

119
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Just listen as you are.</font>

120
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually,</font>

121
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,620
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

122
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,290
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a small problem.</font>

123
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

124
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,090
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a disorder that prevents me from interacting...</font>

125
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,290
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean,</font>

126
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,690
<font color=#FFFF00>I have extreme difficulty interacting with people.</font>

127
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,390
<font color=#FFFF00>If people find out, I might get in trouble.</font>

128
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,820
<font color=#FFFF00>Please keep it to yourself.</font>

129
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

130
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,650
<font color=#FFFF00>What I'm saying is...</font>

131
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,920
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm...</font>

132
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,120
<font color=#FFFF00>really sorry...</font>

133
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,290
<font color=#FFFF00>for giving you a hard time.</font>

134
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,090
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll give you paid leave, so take a rest.</font>

135
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure you get treated.</font>

136
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,590
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll of course pay the medical fees.</font>

137
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, if you'd like,</font>

138
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,490
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll introduce you to a psychotherapist as well.</font>

139
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,750
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't guarantee her competence, though.</font>

140
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,090
<font color=#FFFF00>She...</font>

141
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,790
<font color=#FFFF00>failed to fix me.</font>

142
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,490
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm...</font>

143
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,690
<font color=#FFFF00>so sorry...</font>

144
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,250
<font color=#FFFF00>for giving you a hard time.</font>

145
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,090
<font color=#FFFF00>- The bike has started.
- What are you talking about?</font>

146
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,520
<font color=#FFFF00>I got rid of my constipation.</font>

147
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,150
<font color=#FFFF00>What I mean is...</font>

148
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Eun.</font>

149
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Relax. Breathe.</font>

150
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,320
<font color=#FFFF00>There you go. Start talking again.</font>

151
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,850
<font color=#FFFF00>I finally...</font>

152
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,190
<font color=#FFFF00>I finally told her.</font>

236
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,530
<font color=#FFFF00>We've met before.</font>

237
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,160
<font color=#FFFF00>Well technically, I didn't see your face,</font>

238
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,000
<font color=#FFFF00>so I guess I can't say that we've properly met.</font>

239
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,400
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, I saw a lot of you apart from your face.</font>

255

<font color=#FFFF00>Do you mean Ms. Chae?</font>

256

00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,700
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's nothing.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make him...</font>

299
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,860
<font color=#FFFF00>fall all the way down to the bottom.</font>

300
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,330
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll show you.</font>

301
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,430
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello, Sir.
- Where is Hwan Gi?</font>

302
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Please calm down. Let me explain...</font>

303
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,860
<font color=#FFFF00>He must be shuddering in fear in that penthouse of this.</font>

304
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,630
<font color=#FFFF00>You lead the way.</font>

305
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,400
<font color=#FFFF00>It's my fault. I should've sorted out the situation sooner.</font>

306
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,260
<font color=#FFFF00>But the word didn't leak out because of...</font>

307
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's that secretary?</font>

308
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,660
<font color=#FFFF00>I was just about to try contacting her.</font>

309
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Go bring her right now!</font>

310
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,830
<font color=#FFFF00>That blabbing mouth of hers.</font>

311
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,600
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll cut it all up...</font>

312
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,360
<font color=#FFFF00>and thinly slice her tongue,</font>

313
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,700
<font color=#FFFF00>and store it in a jar with brine.</font>

314
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, what should I do?</font>

315
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,600
<font color=#FFFF00>The former CEO looks like a scary man.</font>

316
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,460
<font color=#FFFF00>I bet he can fire me without even blinking an eye.</font>

317
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,900
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so dead.</font>

318
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did he go?</font>

319
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Please let me handle it. You should just head home now, Sir.</font>

320
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,030
<font color=#FFFF00>"Eun Hwan Gi is apparently Congressman Eun Bok Dong's son."</font>

321
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Reporters are excited about their newly-found prey.</font>

322
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,830
<font color=#FFFF00>You should avoid running into them at all costs.</font>

323
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't worry.</font>

324
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,600
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a plan that can turn this crisis into an opportunity.</font>

325
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,430
<font color=#FFFF00>That project you told me about the other day?</font>

326
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. The only challenge I'd have is persuading Hwan Gi.</font>

327
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me handle him.</font>

328
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir... Sir.</font>

329
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be surprised. Just listen.</font>

330
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,000
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not me. I didn't do it. Please believe me.</font>

331
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,360
<font color=#FFFF00>Please lower your voice.</font>

332
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,630
<font color=#FFFF00>I swear I've never told any of my family or friends about you.</font>

333
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,560
<font color=#FFFF00>I've let my guard down just once. I told just one person.</font>

334
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,060
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no idea that would explode like this.</font>

335
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it really her, then?</font>

336
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,360
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please forgive me, Sir.
- Lower your voice, please.</font>

337
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,730
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll tell you everything.</font>

338
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,200
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll tell you with whom I chatted to.</font>

339
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,860
<font color=#FFFF00>Please let me live.</font>

340
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,500
<font color=#FFFF00>- It was...
- Shut it if you want to live.</font>

341
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Kim, you didn't do anything wrong.</font>

342
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,300
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't disclose anything to anyone.</font>

343
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon me?</font>

344
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,530
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't say anything to anybody. Do you understand?</font>

345
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,200
<font color=#FFFF00>That means... So you're saying...</font>

346
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,800
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter what anyone does to persuade you, keep playing innocent.</font>

347
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Only then, you can get out of this.</font>

348
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

349
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,400
<font color=#FFFF00>So you're worried about me.</font>

350
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Kim.</font>

351
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,560
<font color=#FFFF00>What took you so long?</font>

352
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,800
<font color=#FFFF00>I was really worried about you.</font>

353
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,160
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm saying it because I feel so bad that you have to go through this.</font>

354
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,860
<font color=#FFFF00>I wish you reached out to me sooner.</font>

355
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,160
<font color=#FFFF00>It would've been great if you hadn't signed...</font>

356
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,430
<font color=#FFFF00>the confidentiality agreement when you joined the company.</font>

357
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,660
<font color=#FFFF00>If you leave like this, you'll be known as a whistle-blower...</font>

358
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,830
<font color=#FFFF00>and won't be able to get another job.</font>

359
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,230
<font color=#FFFF00>I... I never said...</font>

360
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,660
<font color=#FFFF00>anything to anyone.</font>

361
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:00,430
<font color=#FFFF00>I already know everything. You can be open with me.</font>

362
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,860
<font color=#FFFF00>That man who came to see you at the hospital. Who is he?</font>

363
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,200
<font color=#FFFF00>It was Mr. Eun.</font>

364
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,760
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Eun visited me at the hospital.</font>

365
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,060
<font color=#FFFF00>- You mean Hwan Gi?
- Yes.</font>

366
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,030
<font color=#FFFF00>You find it hard to believe, right? I was so surprised, too.</font>

367
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,000
<font color=#FFFF00>He even brought me flowers. Why would I do such a thing to him?</font>

368
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,960
<font color=#FFFF00>I really didn't do it.</font>

369
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Please believe me.</font>

370

<font color=#FFFF00>I said right now.</font>

391
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Right now.</font>

392

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,040
<font color=#FFFF00>The person responsible should apologize himself.</font>

446
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Otherwise, it's not sincere.</font>

447
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,830
<font color=#FFFF00>To be an heir of the owner...</font>

448
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,430
<font color=#FFFF00>allows you never to be sorry.</font>

449
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,330
<font color=#FFFF00>It's always the weak that have to be sorry.</font>

450
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to the mess a higher-up made,</font>

451
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,540
<font color=#FFFF00>look at how many staff have to pick up afterwards.</font>

452
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:41,900
<font color=#FFFF00>These days, it's a trend for the CEO to be apologetic...</font>

453
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,870
<font color=#FFFF00>even when a small problem arises.</font>

454
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,630
<font color=#FFFF00>He's old-fashioned.</font>

455
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,930
<font color=#FFFF00>He doesn't know what trend is.</font>

456
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,230
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

457
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,630
<font color=#FFFF00>He'll show up if he's human.</font>

458
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

459
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,870
<font color=#FFFF00>- He's not human.
- He's a zombie.</font>

460
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Regardless... Regardless of my intention,</font>

461
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I ended up...</font>

462
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,000
<font color=#FFFF00>hurting someone.</font>

463
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,570
<font color=#FFFF00>I admit it is something I cannot deny...</font>

464
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,400
<font color=#FFFF00>I can do it. I have to.</font>

465
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I can do it.</font>

466
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you come down here?</font>

467
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,240
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll apologize to everyone myself.</font>

468
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,370
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

469
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Come with me.</font>

470
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,670
<font color=#FFFF00>I said I'll take care of it.</font>

471
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,710
<font color=#FFFF00>You can just hide behind me.</font>

472
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,710
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you cover for me a lot. So this time, I'll do it myself.</font>

473
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,770
<font color=#FFFF00>In that condition?</font>

474
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,540
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you thinking?</font>

475
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,470
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll admit my fault honestly.</font>

476
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,940
<font color=#FFFF00>It might bring what happened three years ago to light.</font>

477
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you be honest about that, too?</font>

478
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that what you're scared of?</font>

479
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you ever been in my office before?</font>

480
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Compared to your penthouse,</font>

481
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,510
<font color=#FFFF00>it looks like a doghouse.</font>

482
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,540
<font color=#FFFF00>- Woo Il.
- But I don't care.</font>

483
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,210
<font color=#FFFF00>People tell me...</font>

484
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,710
<font color=#FFFF00>that I struggle to benefit from my rich friend...</font>

485
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,170
<font color=#FFFF00>and that I shouldn't work too hard...</font>

486
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,410
<font color=#FFFF00>because the money will never be mine.</font>

487
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,410
<font color=#FFFF00>The money will go to the ghost CEO.</font>

488
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,040
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter what they say,</font>

489
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,010
<font color=#FFFF00>I've always tried to...</font>

490
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,940
<font color=#FFFF00>make things easier for you...</font>

491
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,270
<font color=#FFFF00>and cover up your weaknesses.</font>

492
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Just like you covered up my secret.</font>

493
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. What happened three years ago...</font>

494
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,870
<font color=#FFFF00>will remain hidden.</font>

495
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,740
<font color=#FFFF00>So please let me talk to the people.</font>

496
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,440
<font color=#FFFF00>This is not like you.</font>

497
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,470
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you really Hwan Gi?
- I have to do it for it to end.</font>

498
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing will end. I'll make sure nothing ends.</font>

499
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Just trust me.</font>

500
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,140
<font color=#FFFF00>- This time, I...
- Can you...</font>

501
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,640
<font color=#FFFF00>really stand before all those people?</font>

502
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you really express your opinions correctly in front of everyone?</font>

503
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,940
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're confident that you won't make a fool of yourself, do it.</font>

504
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

505
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Hwan Gi, I'm sorry for being harsh.</font>

506
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,810
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm getting impatient because the reporters are waiting.</font>

507
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,410
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll keep it short.</font>

508
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you step down from your position for the time being?</font>

509
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,840
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just a formality, you know.</font>

510
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,640
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I should. I was going to.</font>

511
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Instead,</font>

512
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,810
<font color=#FFFF00>take charge of a new project.</font>

513
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Your father will tell you the details.</font>

514
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,870
<font color=#FFFF00>He's waiting for you.</font>

515
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,540
<font color=#FFFF00>You two decided on what I should do?</font>

516
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,070
<font color=#FFFF00>He must have calmed down by now.</font>

517
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,010
<font color=#FFFF00>I had a hard time calming him down.</font>

518
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,640
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to go now.</font>

519
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:23,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you really stand before all those people?</font>

520
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,610
<font color=#FFFF00>We're sorry for making you wait.</font>

521
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,010
<font color=#FFFF00>We have someone here who can clear up all the misunderstanding.</font>

522
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:50,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Please sit there.</font>

523
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:05,710
<font color=#FFFF00>See?</font>

524
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,010
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm...</font>

525
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Eun Hwan Gi's secretary.</font>

526
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,340
<font color=#FFFF00>The article is...</font>

527
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,910
<font color=#FFFF00>completely false.</font>

528
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,210
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

529
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,110
<font color=#FFFF00>I was hospitalized...</font>

530
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,140
<font color=#FFFF00>because of my chronic disease.</font>

531
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:45,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Eun even visited me at the hospital with flowers...</font>

532
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,440
<font color=#FFFF00>and cheered me up.</font>

533
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:52,710
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm very perplexed...</font>

534
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:58,140
<font color=#FFFF00>that false things about me have been published against my will.</font>

535
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Eun and my colleagues,</font>

536
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:06,910
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry for the trouble I caused the company.</font>

537
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:12,070
<font color=#FFFF00>- I have a question.
- I have a question.</font>

538
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:15,340
<font color=#FFFF00>You seem to be in a bad condition. Did you come here voluntarily?</font>

539
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,170
<font color=#FFFF00>As you just said,</font>

540
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,840
<font color=#FFFF00>was there no cruel treatment?</font>

541
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you met Mr. Eun?</font>

542
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you put under coercion?</font>

543
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Please explain.</font>

544
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:31,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on.</font>

545
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,840
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the CEO of Brain, Kang Woo Il.</font>

546
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:43,810
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll answer your questions, considering my employee's condition.</font>

547
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Mr. Eun?</font>

548
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:55,440
<font color=#FFFF00>He couldn't adjust his plans abroad,</font>

549
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,470
<font color=#FFFF00>so he's still outside of Korea.</font>

550
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,470
<font color=#FFFF00>That's all a lie.</font>

551
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,470
<font color=#FFFF00>You're stuck in your room every day.</font>

552
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you call yourself a man?</font>

553
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:30,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you do any better?</font>

554
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,710
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you said you're quite good when you play against a wall.</font>

555
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Golf and tennis.</font>

556
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:41,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Real sports let you mingle with other people.</font>

557
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you make a fool of yourself whenever people look at you?</font>

558
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you always get so timid in front of people?</font>

559
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

560
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does Mr. Eun never show up in front of people?</font>

561
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,770
<font color=#FFFF00>We just divided our work efficiently.</font>

562
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Eun takes care of the internal matters of the company,</font>

563
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,710
<font color=#FFFF00>and I undertake all the external businesses.</font>

564
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Three years ago, Mr. Eun's secretary jumped from the office rooftop.</font>

565
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,440
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is that...
- That's not related to this at all.</font>

566
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:26,940
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a rumor that Mr. Eun is impossible to communicate with.</font>

567
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,840
<font color=#FFFF00>That's exaggerated.</font>

568
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:33,510
<font color=#FFFF00>But I humbly admit that there was not enough communication.</font>

569
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:37,340
<font color=#FFFF00>To prevent any further misunderstandings,</font>

570
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,040
<font color=#FFFF00>we've come up with an improvement plan.</font>

571
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Eun...</font>

572
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,070
<font color=#FFFF00>will be resigning...</font>

573
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,410
<font color=#FFFF00>from his position.</font>

574
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:00,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this.</font>

575
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,510
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

576
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,670
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't win that position because you deserved it.</font>

577
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,770
<font color=#FFFF00>We're starting a venture in the company.</font>

578
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:24,710
<font color=#FFFF00>And you'll take charge of the team.</font>

579
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,940
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sorry?
- Break out of the egg.</font>

580
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Be reborn.</font>

581
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,310
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't.</font>

582
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,340
<font color=#FFFF00>This is your last chance.</font>

583
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:43,340
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't pull yourself together, I'll give the company to Woo Il.</font>

584
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,910
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not interested in taking over the company.</font>

585
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:48,910
<font color=#FFFF00>What? How dare you say that?</font>

586
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,040
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

587
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:54,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

588
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:58,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd rather start something alone.</font>

589
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Alone? What nonsense!</font>

590
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,370
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't do anything alone from now on.</font>

591
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:06,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Come in.</font>

592
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay seated.</font>

593
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:22,170
<font color=#FFFF00>You should learn to mingle with people.</font>

594
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,970
<font color=#FFFF00>An in-house venture doesn't have the customary corporate structure.</font>

595
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:35,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Neither does it have rigid hierarchy...</font>

596
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,270
<font color=#FFFF00>nor unnecessary formalities that can hinder the organization's growth.</font>

597
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,970
<font color=#FFFF00>In that new horizontal structure, Mr. Eun Hwan Gi will become...</font>

598
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,810
<font color=#FFFF00>a leader with communicative leadership who can have...</font>

599
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,940
<font color=#FFFF00>flourishing relationships with our employees.</font>

600
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,710
<font color=#FFFF00>In-house venture? What is going on?</font>

601
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,210
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh, that's so clever.</font>

602
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,470
<font color=#FFFF00>They'll avoid the blame...</font>

603
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:05,140
<font color=#FFFF00>and pretend that he's giving up his CEO position when he's actually not.</font>

604
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,370
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

605
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:07,970
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a question.</font>

606
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,770
<font color=#FFFF00>This decision will shock many people considering that Mr. Eun...</font>

607
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,870
<font color=#FFFF00>is the heir of the company.</font>

608
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Has the founder of the company, Congressman Eun, agreed to it?</font>

609
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

610
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Many second-generation conglomerates have been involved in scandals.</font>

611
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though the article is false,</font>

612
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,640
<font color=#FFFF00>he is deeply distressed because it may have hurt some people.</font>

613
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,070
<font color=#FFFF00>He asked us to fundamentally revamp our corporate system.</font>

614
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:32,640
<font color=#FFFF00>I promise that we will change.</font>

615
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,010
<font color=#FFFF00>I sincerely apologize...</font>

616
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,410
<font color=#FFFF00>for causing you concern.</font>

617
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kang never disappoints me.</font>

618
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,010
<font color=#FFFF00>He's so good at everything,</font>

619
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,240
<font color=#FFFF00>but his crisis management skills are truly outstanding.</font>

620
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,940
<font color=#FFFF00>From planning to execution, he gets everything done like a thunderbolt.</font>

621
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:04,340
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this.</font>

622
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,270
<font color=#FFFF00>What about Eun Hwan Gi?</font>

623
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:08,670
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't even show up here.</font>

624
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you do that?</font>

625
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Look who's talking. Why are you doing this to me?</font>

626
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Mr. Kang make you lie?</font>

627
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,840
<font color=#FFFF00>It's true that Mr. Eun visited me at the hospital...</font>

628
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,540
<font color=#FFFF00>with flowers.</font>

629
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,840
<font color=#FFFF00>That psychopath didn't even step out of his office when you were...</font>

630
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,170
<font color=#FFFF00>almost dying right in front of his door.</font>

631
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,940
<font color=#FFFF00>The article came out regardless of my intent.</font>

632
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep your lips sealed unless you want both of us to be doomed.</font>

633
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,670
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't know each other.</font>

634
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,970
<font color=#FFFF00>We've never even seen or talked to each other.</font>

635
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,340
<font color=#FFFF00>You got money from them, didn't you?</font>

636
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,310
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you...</font>

637
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,070
<font color=#FFFF00>How much did they give you?</font>

638
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:19,440
<font color=#FFFF00>It must've been quite a bit.</font>

639
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,940
<font color=#FFFF00>That must be why you gave up on your conscience...</font>

640
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I sold my conscience.</font>

641
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,540
<font color=#FFFF00>What was I supposed to do?</font>

642
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of some missionary of justice,</font>

643
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,840
<font color=#FFFF00>I lost my job. My conscience was the only thing I could sell!</font>

644
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,170
<font color=#FFFF00>You can get another job.</font>

645
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:36,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean, this isn't the only company...</font>

646
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:39,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Who'd want to hire a whistle-blower?</font>

647
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

648
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I just wanted to help you.</font>

649
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,570
<font color=#FFFF00>You couldn't even raise your head up...</font>

650
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:51,970
<font color=#FFFF00>or look at him when you were talking to him.</font>

651
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:54,670
<font color=#FFFF00>But in return for putting up with all of that,</font>

652
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,670
<font color=#FFFF00>I was able to buy food for my family and pay the utility bills.</font>

653
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,170
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have told you anything.</font>

654
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hye.</font>

655
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,170
<font color=#FFFF00>You must've been this distressed, too.</font>

656
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,540
<font color=#FFFF00>You were in so much pain,</font>

657
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,470
<font color=#FFFF00>yet you couldn't even let out a squeal.</font>

658
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:58,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Lie face down.</font>

659
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,170
<font color=#FFFF00>I said, face down. Lie face down completely.</font>

660
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:13,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Lie on your stomach.</font>

661
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:27,070
<font color=#FFFF00>The scrubbing towel feels so rough on my skin.</font>

662
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,570
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks like he pulled out a new one for me, so I should be thankful.</font>

663
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,310
<font color=#FFFF00>There must be a reason why it hurts so much.</font>

664
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:36,610
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a specialist. He must know the most ideal scrubbing intensity...</font>

665
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,410
<font color=#FFFF00>for removing dead skin.</font>

666
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,670
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh, look at how much he's sweating.</font>

667
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:44,010
<font color=#FFFF00>He's trying to do his very best to fulfill his given task.</font>

668
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,910
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be letting him down if I complain and ask him to be gentle.</font>

669
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,170
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel as if my skin is on fire.</font>

670
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,910
<font color=#FFFF00>He might actually be trying...</font>

671
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:55,140
<font color=#FFFF00>to relieve his own stress by scrubbing me as hard as he can.</font>

672
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:58,370
<font color=#FFFF00>What kinds of things has he been through in life? He's so aggressive.</font>

673
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Is one of his family members ill?</font>

674
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he desperate for the hospital fee?</font>

675
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure that he's trying so hard to forget pain.</font>

676
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,440
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just lying down.</font>

677
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,210
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't... I cannot complain.</font>

679
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,470
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. You should've told me if it hurt that much.</font>

680
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:20,240
<font color=#FFFF00>- You've been enduring it all?
- Sorry?</font>

681
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Lie down on your back again.</font>

682
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:23,810
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to scrub the parts I missed.</font>

683
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:26,110
<font color=#FFFF00>You little...</font>

684
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:30,940
<font color=#FFFF00>They completely got me this time.</font>

685
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:33,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Kang Woo Il was the dark horse.</font>

686
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,170
<font color=#FFFF00>He was prepared for every single possible scenario.</font>

687
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,270
<font color=#FFFF00>I bet everyone in the company was expecting a scandal like that.</font>

688
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Exactly.</font>

689
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,040
<font color=#FFFF00>They probably started working on the plans three years ago.</font>

690
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,240
<font color=#FFFF00>People are calling it the most ideal crisis management strategy...</font>

691
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,240
<font color=#FFFF00>and highly praising Brain's competency.</font>

692
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,270
<font color=#FFFF00>We ended up benefiting them.</font>

693
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Eun Hwan Gi's dad, Congressman Eun Bok Dong.</font>

694
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,810
<font color=#FFFF00>He founded Brain with nothing,</font>

695
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,040
<font color=#FFFF00>and he's now aiming to get elected as the mayor of Seoul.</font>

696
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:02,270
<font color=#FFFF00>It won't be easy to take them down.</font>

697
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take all of them down,</font>

698
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:08,810
<font color=#FFFF00>including that psychopath's dad who put a silver spoon in his mouth.</font>

699
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:12,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget being a mayor. He'll be too humiliated to even leave the house.</font>

700
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:14,440
<font color=#FFFF00>You should leave that company.</font>

701
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:15,840
<font color=#FFFF00>You've done enough.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

703
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:20,110
<font color=#FFFF00>They completely destroyed my family.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You might end up in danger...</font>

705
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:27,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what infuriates me the most?</font>

706
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,640
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the fact that the psychopath did not show up.</font>

707
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,570
<font color=#FFFF00>He put Kang Woo Il on the frontline and made him apologize.</font>

708
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:42,940
<font color=#FFFF00>He hid behind him and didn't even lift a finger.</font>

713
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,540

715
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,040
<font color=#FFFF00>He does pique my curiosity.</font>

716
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Then go ahead and apply.</font>

717
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:15,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'm crazy?</font>

718
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall I apply?</font>

719
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,040
<font color=#FFFF00>- You?
- You?</font>

720
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,770
<font color=#FFFF00>It'll be such an easy job.</font>

721
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:24,610
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll just have to make sure not to get on his nerves...</font>

722
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,670
<font color=#FFFF00>and flatter him as much as possible.</font>

723
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to be unemployed for the rest of your life or what?</font>

724
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,240
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm telling you. It's all for a show.</font>

725
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:34,970
<font color=#FFFF00>The project itself will be cancelled in no time.</font>

726
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:38,310
<font color=#FFFF00>No way. I mean, he's the founder's son.</font>

727
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:43,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Kang Woo Il is obviously doing it to demote Eun Hwan Gi.</font>

728
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:46,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Being cutthroat about it will look bad,</font>

729
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:48,940
<font color=#FFFF00>so he's trying to be a little polite.</font>

730
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:51,970
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you're right.</font>

731
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,970

00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:16,770
<font color=#FFFF00>You keep getting distracted as you have too much time on your hands.</font>

738
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:18,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get some work done, okay?</font>

739
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. You know what to do, right? Everything here.</font>

740
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,270
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you!</font>

741
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:31,240
<font color=#FFFF00>If you misplace any of them, you'll receive a death sentence.</font>

742
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Send them to the photoshoot locations via express courier,</font>

743
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:37,240
<font color=#FFFF00>but make sure all the handmade decorations don't get damaged.</font>

744
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:40,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Handle them gently as you'd treat babies.</font>

745
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,970
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to be very careful.</font>

746
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, you must be punctual and meet all the deadlines.</font>

747
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:46,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Those in fashion are known for their impatience.</font>

748
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:49,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay!</font>

749
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Because I'm fond of you,</font>

750
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:56,670
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm giving you a chance to be the boss.</font>

751
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,370
<font color=#FFFF00>A chance to be the boss?</font>

752
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:00,370
<font color=#FFFF00>When you work at a PR agency,</font>

753
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:04,370
<font color=#FFFF00>you have to put up with the media and clients without losing a smile.</font>

754
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:08,110
<font color=#FFFF00>The only people we can boss around are those express couriers.</font>

755
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:11,270
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

756
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

757
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep them on a tight leash, okay?</font>

758
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes! Of course.</font>

759
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:31,940
<font color=#FFFF00>All right, let's do this.</font>

760
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, I saw you on the rooftop.</font>

761
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you not the guy?</font>

762
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:47,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I mistaken?</font>

763
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going?</font>

764
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,170
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the guy.</font>

765
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you trying to run away?</font>

766
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:01,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Why can't you look at me in the eye?</font>

767
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:03,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you...</font>

768
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,070
<font color=#FFFF00>a newbie?</font>

769
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,570
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be a newbie express courier.</font>

770
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not picking on you, so don't be scared. Everyone starts somewhere.</font>

771
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,010
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm new, too.</font>

772
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:25,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Here's another weird guy.</font>

773
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:29,570
<font color=#FFFF00>He walks around with his head down and can't even make eye contact.</font>

774
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:37,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, my eye...</font>

775
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:39,370
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

776
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:41,610
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened to your eye?</font>

777
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:46,340
<font color=#FFFF00>I like that you're looking at me in the eye now.</font>

778
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:52,340
<font color=#FFFF00>What scares you? Do you think I'll shoot laser beams out of my eyes?</font>

779
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,770
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a photo shoot taking place in Ilsan Lake Park.</font>

780
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:58,710
<font color=#FFFF00>You just have to get there in one hour.</font>

781
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:03,270
<font color=#FFFF00>You have plenty of time, so please ride your motorcycle safely.</font>

782
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,940
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pardon?
- We'll see each other often.</font>

783
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:11,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait...</font>

784
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's not run into each other again on the rooftop, though.</font>

785
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,240
<font color=#FFFF00>I believe in you!</font>

786
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:01,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do I have to do this? It's her fault for jumping to conclusions.</font>

787
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:04,340
<font color=#FFFF00>I never said that I work for an express courier service.</font>

788
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:16,710
<font color=#FFFF00>If these things disappear into thin air,</font>

789
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:20,770
<font color=#FFFF00>the photoshoot will be affected, and she'll get in trouble.</font>

790
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,610
<font color=#FFFF00>It may be enough reason to fire her.</font>

791
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:39,410
<font color=#FFFF00>I do feel bad, but I have to straighten things out.</font>

792
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:43,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I shouldn't go. Get off the car now.</font>

793
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:12,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon? The courier didn't arrive yet?</font>

794
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,370
<font color=#FFFF00>That's strange. We sent them via courier before we left the office.</font>

795
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:18,910
<font color=#FFFF00>- You sent them out, right?
- Yes. I sent them.</font>

796
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:20,640
<font color=#FFFF00>We're ready to roll.</font>

797
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:22,470
<font color=#FFFF00>- Call the courier guy.
- Okay.</font>

798
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:28,670
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have his phone number.</font>

799
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:30,240
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- Who was it?</font>

800
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Which company?</font>

801
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:35,710
<font color=#FFFF00>He's new. He came to our office to promote the company.</font>

802
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... He's not bad looking and...</font>

803
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why you forgot to ask him for his business card?</font>

804
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,940
<font color=#FFFF00>I got his business card on the rooftop...</font>

805
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:47,470
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't really say I got it. I found the one he dropped, but I...</font>

806
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:48,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Call the courier companies and locate the order.</font>

807
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:51,240
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hurry up!
- Okay.</font>

808
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:54,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. I just...</font>

809
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:58,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I would've already called the police.</font>

810
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,870
<font color=#FFFF00>It actually turned out for the best. I mean, this is what I wanted.</font>

811
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:36,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be late anyway.</font>

812
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,140
<font color=#FFFF00>The photoshoot will have to be rescheduled, and they'll complain.</font>

813
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:43,210
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's none of my business since I'm no longer the CEO of Brain.</font>

814
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:46,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I should turn my car around.</font>

815
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,270
<font color=#FFFF00>- What is going on?
- Gosh.</font>

816
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:15,710
<font color=#FFFF00>What should we do? What a disaster!</font>

817
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,910
<font color=#FFFF00>No one has received the order. Are you sure he's a courier guy?</font>

818
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, he is. I'm certain.</font>

819
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:23,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Why else do you think he took them?</font>

820
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:25,270
<font color=#FFFF00>It's obviously because they're very expensive designer stuff.</font>

821
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:27,770
<font color=#FFFF00>We have no time to waste like this. Call the police now.</font>

822
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:29,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Just a moment.</font>

823
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:33,380
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's wait just a bit more.
- He obviously stole them.</font>

824
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:37,010
<font color=#FFFF00>- He'll never do such a thing.
- You've never even seen him before.</font>

825
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:39,310
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you don't know his name or his phone number.</font>

826
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:40,810
<font color=#FFFF00>That's true, but...</font>

827
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:43,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you two a team? Is that it?</font>

828
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:48,840
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you two splitting them?
- Pardon me?</font>

829
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:51,540
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gosh, no way.
- This is why.</font>

830
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:55,070
<font color=#FFFF00>This is precisely why you have to be careful when hiring new employees.</font>

831
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:00,740
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. It's all my fault. I actually...</font>

832
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:06,040
<font color=#FFFF00>asked Ro Woon to take care of arranging the courier delivery.</font>

833
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:08,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? What were you doing? Tell me.</font>

834
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,610
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't even do that much.</font>

835
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:17,010
<font color=#FFFF00>There're so many people here. Don't get so worked up. Go easy on me.</font>

836
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:21,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you talk politely to me since there are so many people here?</font>

837
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:25,440
<font color=#FFFF00>We did go to the same school, but I can't go easy on you all the time.</font>

838
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:27,610
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you understand, Ms. Dang?
- Yes.</font>

839
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,140
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Ms. Park.</font>

840
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:34,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you still not figure out what's going on?</font>

841
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:46,710
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. I'm...</font>

842
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:51,470
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm... I'm sorry.</font>

843
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:55,110
<font color=#FFFF00>It's always the weak that have to be sorry.</font>

844
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:05,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I beg you.</font>

845
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:10,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I implore you,</font>

846
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:17,610
<font color=#FFFF00>so please trust him.</font>

847
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you really going to be this bull-headed?</font>

848
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:22,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I promise you that I'll find them.</font>

849
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:24,880
<font color=#FFFF00>So please don't call the police yet.</font>

850
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:27,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give me some time. Just a little bit of time.</font>

851
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Please wait just a little bit.</font>

852
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:32,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, get yourself back...</font>

853
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,170
<font color=#FFFF00>What is going on?</font>

854
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:46,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Even Mr. Kang is here now.</font>

855
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,910
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sorry, Mr. Kang.</font>

856
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:52,940
<font color=#FFFF00>The thing that I've been worried about finally happened.</font>

857
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:22,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Where on earth is he?</font>

858
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:25,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he get into an accident?</font>

859
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:28,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is he?</font>

860
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:05,380
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is he now?</font>

861
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:07,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did he go?</font>

862
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:17,570
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew it!</font>

863
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:19,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at that.</font>

864
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,070
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew he would come.</font>

865
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:23,540
<font color=#FFFF00>He even gave up his motorbike...</font>

866
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,440
<font color=#FFFF00>and ran all the way here.</font>

867
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:28,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Here!</font>

868
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,340
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been waiting for you!</font>

869
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:44,440
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have come here.</font>

870
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:48,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for coming!</font>

871
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:52,810
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have gone near her in the first place.</font>

872
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:04,410
<font color=#FFFF00>There we go.</font>

873
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:06,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you so much for all of your support.</font>

874
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:12,240
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have hovered around her.</font>

875
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,910
<font color=#FFFF00>I had faith in you!</font>

876
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:20,380
<font color=#FFFF00>What if she finds out who I am?</font>

877
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:30,940
<font color=#FFFF00>If I told her then...</font>

878
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:35,070
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew you'd come!</font>

879
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:39,570
<font color=#FFFF00>No, before that...</font>

880
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there something you want to say to me?</font>

881
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:49,880
<font color=#FFFF00>If only I had told her...</font>

882
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:35,410
<font color=#FFFF00>If only I had said anything to her...</font>

883
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:50,840
<font color=#FFFF00>If I tell her now,</font>

884
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:53,240
<font color=#FFFF00>will I be able to make things right?</font>

885
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Move!</font>

886
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:57,410
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

887
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:00,110
<font color=#FFFF00>- Move!
- I can't hear you.</font>

888
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:03,940
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't hear you.</font>

889
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:05,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Or is it...</font>

890
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:08,270
<font color=#FFFF00>too late now?</font>

01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:01,740
<font color=#FFFF00>(MY SHY BOSS)</font>

893
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,240
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a new beginning and a new challenge.</font>

894
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:04,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you hear?</font>

895
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,440
<font color=#FFFF00>The penthouse will be opened.</font>

896
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,140
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's unbelievable.
- Why here, of all places?</font>

897
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,940
<font color=#FFFF00>She might get hurt if my cover gets blown.</font>

898
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,940
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you eat?
- Yes.</font>

899
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:14,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry.</font>

900
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,970
<font color=#FFFF00>This is only the beginning of my revenge.</font>

901
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,470
<font color=#FFFF00>I've picked out members for the venture.</font>

902
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:23,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget it. I have a few on my mind.</font>

903
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:24,710
<font color=#FFFF00>There's one more.</font>

904
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:27,010
<font color=#FFFF00>- Trust me.
- Have you two already become close?</font>

905
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,140
<font color=#FFFF00>She's cheerful and energetic just like I used to be.</font>

906
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:31,310
<font color=#FFFF00>I like her.</font>

907
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:32,540
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll soon find out...</font>

908
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:35,210
<font color=#FFFF00>who he really is.</font>

909
01:14:35,310 --> 01:14:37,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Meet the leader of Silent Monster,</font>

910
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Eun Hwan Gi.</font>
