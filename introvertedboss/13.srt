00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Please... don't do this.</font>

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,680
<font color=#FFFF00>It was a mistake.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Kang Woo Il...</font>

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,340

<font color=#FFFF00>Stay back!</font>

12
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,350

I can never leave him!</font>

15

<font color=#FFFF00>So if you're truly sorry...</font>

16
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,780

and disappear.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Please.</font>

18
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,530
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't look so good.</font>

19
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,850
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, but let's see
the exhibition another time.</font>

20
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, that's okay!
You should go to the hospital.</font>

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh! CEO Kang! Eun Yi Soo
went to the hospital with Boss.</font>

22
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,530

23
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,520
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. Eun Yi Soo
invited me to your wedding.</font>

24
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to bring a gift,
but I don't know...</font>

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he embarrassed?</font>

29
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,550
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll have to look at your art by myself.</font>

30
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh. I guess Hwan Ki
only came here to see me.</font>

31
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, I'm sure he
didn't come just for that.</font>

32
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,150
<font color=#FFFF00>From now on, you'll feel ignored and sad
because of me. Use my art for comfort.</font>

33
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,400
<font color=#FFFF00>The art will help you calm down.</font>

35
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,720

about Secretary Chae's family...</font>

36
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,890
<font color=#FFFF00>you didn't mean Chae Ro Woon, did you?</font>

37
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,790
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right.</font>

38
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,590
<font color=#FFFF00>She's Secretary Chae's younger sister.</font>

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all right?</font>

41
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you know...</font>

42
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Chae Ro Woon made Woo Il fall for her?</font>

43
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you think I pretended
I didn't know anything?</font>

44
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,590
<font color=#FFFF00>I was so scared that Woo Il
would end up like this!</font>

45
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,450
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I needed to pretend
like I didn't know anything.</font>

46
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,830
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't want the same thing
to happen again.</font>

47
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,270
<font color=#FFFF00>But she's her younger sister.</font>

48
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,310
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this ill-fated relationship?</font>

49
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,650
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think there's a chance
she did it intentionally?</font>

50
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she plan to steal
Woo Il away from me?</font>

51
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,930
<font color=#FFFF00>She doesn't know anything yet.</font>

52
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,560
<font color=#FFFF00>And he was only interested
in her for a short while.</font>

53
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,510
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

54
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you know about it too?</font>

55
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,100
<font color=#FFFF00>If you knew, how could you...</font>

56
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is Chae Ro Woon to you? Who is she?</font>

57
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is she that you're
cornering me like this? Tell me!</font>

58
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you actually love her?</font>

59
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you stupid?</font>

60
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,440
<font color=#FFFF00>You two will never work out.</font>

61
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,950
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks like you're about
to expose everything for her</font>

62
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,060
<font color=#FFFF00>but your relationship will end
as soon as you do so!</font>

63
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,000
<font color=#FFFF00>So let go of her.</font>

64
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,380
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, but please make the sacrifice.</font>

65

<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

66
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,740

67
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,940

but I was dumped for his sister.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

70
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,560

be pushed aside so early.</font>

71
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't contact you first.</font>

72
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not going to talk to you
until you talk to me first!</font>

88
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,110
<font color=#FFFF00>You even found a mysticism artist
who is difficult to contact</font>

89
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,280
<font color=#FFFF00>and the client approved.</font>

90
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. It was good up until that point.</font>

91
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,980
<font color=#FFFF00>But the problems arose after that.</font>

92
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Here. Have some coffee
and tell me about it.</font>

98
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, your samples are pretty out there</font>

99
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,860
<font color=#FFFF00>so I'm worried they won't
appeal to our consumers.</font>

100
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Um, don't worry.</font>

103
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,030
<font color=#FFFF00>to graft my art as well?</font>

pretty designs! Pretty designs!</font>

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,590

111
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,370
<font color=#FFFF00>If you tell us what you want
in more detail</font>

112
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,850
<font color=#FFFF00>it'll be easier for us
to do what you ask.</font>

113
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,430
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm telling you... I want pretty designs!</font>

114
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, so pretty in what way?</font>

115
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my, listen to him. Oh my.</font>

116
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,380
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand both sides.
But it's still driving me crazy.</font>

117
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,730
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like I can take sides.</font>

118
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, drink both.</font>

119
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,600
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pardon?
- I'll make another one for myself.</font>

120
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, really? Thank you.</font>

121
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,960
<font color=#FFFF00>They're both so good
despite what's going on.</font>

122
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,200
<font color=#FFFF00>What did I tell you?
I told you it won't be easy!</font>

123
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Geez.</font>

124
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,270
<font color=#FFFF00>And where's the general
who came up with this great idea?</font>

125
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,870
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm right here.</font>

126
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Geez. Hello, there.</font>

127
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,610
<font color=#FFFF00>But I still think Se Jong is better
at interacting with your clients.</font>

128
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:44,010
<font color=#FFFF00>But I have the habit of saying
whatever is on my mind</font>

129
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,270
<font color=#FFFF00>so both sides are unhappy with me.</font>

130
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,370
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I'll be going to the
meetings alone from now on.</font>

131
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,800
<font color=#FFFF00>At this rate,
what if our project founders?</font>

132
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, we can't let that happen.</font>

133
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,140
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll meet both clients
and see what I can do.</font>

134
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Really? Thank you so much!</font>

135
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,470
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

136
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,040
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like you to finish what you started.</font>

137
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,820
<font color=#FFFF00>But still, she lacks experience...</font>

138
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,340
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a valuable experience for you.</font>

139
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I understand, Boss.
No, Mr. Hwan Ki.</font>

140
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,840
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?
Nothing has changed since last time!</font>

141
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,720
<font color=#FFFF00>The worth of our products will decrease</font>

142
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,410
<font color=#FFFF00>and the aesthetic sense will fall too!</font>

143
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at this.</font>

144
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,190
<font color=#FFFF00>If it were you, would you buy this?</font>

145
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:51,260
<font color=#FFFF00>If your boyfriend bought it for you,
would you wear it?</font>

146
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,470
<font color=#FFFF00>I know it's a little unique...</font>

147
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,140
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this? It's empty.</font>

148
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me get you another one.</font>

149
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, in comparison to
when that male employee was here</font>

150
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,820
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like we have an understanding.</font>

151
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, really? What a relief...</font>

152
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh! Oh my gosh!</font>

153
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my! Why is it raining
all of a sudden? I forgot my umbrella!</font>

154
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,160
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go and buy you an umbrella!</font>

155
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, what brings you here?</font>

156
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,240
<font color=#FFFF00>It's late, and I heard
it was going to rain.</font>

157
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,360
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is this?</font>

158
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,140
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh, this is...
- We don't have titles at our company.</font>

159
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,990
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a driver right now.</font>

160
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,630
<font color=#FFFF00>- Huh?
- Let's go.</font>

161
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my! You didn't have to...</font>

162
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,500
<font color=#FFFF00>No, this is for Gyo Ri.</font>

163
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,820
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pardon? Me?
- Not me?</font>

164
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take this.</font>

165
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,810
<font color=#FFFF00>You're only giving me an umbrella?</font>

166
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall I call you a taxi?</font>

167
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,990
<font color=#FFFF00>No, my company is close by...</font>

168
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, please return safely.</font>

169
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,360
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please get in.
- Wait, but...</font>

170
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Get in.</font>

171
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,760
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this? What is this situation?</font>

172
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,660
<font color=#FFFF00>But can we really do this?</font>

173
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe we should have
taken care of our client first.</font>

174
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you leave because
you finished your meeting?</font>

175
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, that's true...</font>

176
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,190
<font color=#FFFF00>but I don't deserve this treatment.</font>

177
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,000
<font color=#FFFF00>You were there as a representative
of Silent Monster.</font>

178
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,350
<font color=#FFFF00>You did what a CEO does,
so you should be treated like one.</font>

179
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, there's no way...</font>

180
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,440
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really uncomfortable right now.</font>

181
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,950
<font color=#FFFF00>If you can pull over so I can sit
in the front passenger seat...</font>

182
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:37,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, then... I'd be uncomfortable.</font>

183
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I see.</font>

184
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,840
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder why I ever thought you
were scary and difficult to approach.</font>

185
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,940
<font color=#FFFF00>I realized you had a cute side
when I got to know you.</font>

186
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,870
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I was just being sensitive.</font>

187
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,110
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because you feel more emotions
than the average person.</font>

188
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Me?</font>

189
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,870
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why you feel more anxious,
and you're sad more often than others.</font>

190
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,440
<font color=#FFFF00>It must be difficult for you</font>

191
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,980
<font color=#FFFF00>but feeling emotions
that others cannot feel</font>

192
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,890
<font color=#FFFF00>is a great advantage.</font>

193
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,550
<font color=#FFFF00>No one has ever said that to me before.</font>

194
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone just asks me why I'm so weak.</font>

195
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,770
<font color=#FFFF00>The ability to feel the emotions
others cannot sense in someone else</font>

196
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,550
<font color=#FFFF00>is something only you can understand.</font>

197
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,060
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you, Boss, no, Mr. Hwan Ki,
would know more about that.</font>

198
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:48,730
<font color=#FFFF00>But for how much longer
will you call me by that long name?</font>

199
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon? Oh.</font>

200
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,330
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll call you by a
shorter name from now on.</font>

201
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Hwan Ki.</font>

202
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,330
<font color=#FFFF00>- Make it short.
- Yes.</font>

203
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Hwan Ki.</font>

204
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,980
<font color=#FFFF00>You want it to be prettier?</font>

205
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,160
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're only looking at the business
aspect, there's nothing in it for me.</font>

206
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Just like what I said last time</font>

207
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't the aim of this collaboration
to graft my art onto these pieces?</font>

208
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:26,580
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. Your art and your designs are
already valuable in an artistic sense.</font>

209
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,330
<font color=#FFFF00>But, ma'am...</font>

210
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my... Oh my!</font>

211
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,190
<font color=#FFFF00>If this is how it's going to be,
I'm going to cut our budget!</font>

212
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,780
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I'm saying!</font>

213
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Our company's aim
is to sell our products.</font>

214
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,700
<font color=#FFFF00>But, General Manager...</font>

215
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,280
<font color=#FFFF00>unique designs are the
popular trend these days.</font>

216
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone has the desire to wear
something that no one else has.</font>

217
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Wouldn't you also want to give your
girlfriend a pretty, yet unique gift?</font>

218
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,030
<font color=#FFFF00>- A little bit.
- A little bit?</font>

219
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Gyo Ri! Gyo Ri! You convinced both sides?</font>

220
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,540
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you do that?</font>

221
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I didn't say much.
I just listened for the most part.</font>

222
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,050
<font color=#FFFF00>You told me it wasn't easy.</font>

223
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,550
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm impressed, Gyo Ri.
- No, it wasn't me.</font>

224
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,590
<font color=#FFFF00>It was all thanks to Hwan Ki.</font>

225
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going this time?</font>

226
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,610
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you gave Gyo Ri a ride yesterday.</font>

227
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you planning to
spend time with tonight?</font>

228
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,910
<font color=#FFFF00>It feels like
I have a cheating boyfriend.</font>

229
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,700
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I told you to go home.</font>

230
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you meeting Yeon Jung, by any chance?</font>

231
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,240
<font color=#FFFF00>It must be true!</font>

232
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Smile.</font>

233
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,920
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

234
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you taking pictures
all of a sudden?</font>

235
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,290
<font color=#FFFF00>It turned out so nicely.</font>

236
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,960
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm sending it to Ro Woon to brag.
- Hey, stop joking around!</font>

237
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not joking. I'm just pretending I am.</font>

238
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:03,270
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried that if I keep clinging
to you, I'll drag you down with me.</font>

239
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,500
<font color=#FFFF00>If it gets too difficult,
just come to me, Hwan Ki.</font>

240
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeon Jung.</font>

241
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,560
<font color=#FFFF00>- I...
- Why do we keep getting mixed up?</font>

242
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm pretty upset about it, to be honest.</font>

243
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,750
<font color=#FFFF00>But I'm starting to think
that this must be our fate.</font>

244
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,420
<font color=#FFFF00>For letting me hear your thoughts...</font>

245
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,240
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm thankful to you.</font>

246
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,050
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the one who's thankful.</font>

247
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:38,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for listening to my thoughts
that I can't reveal to anyone else.</font>

248
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:43,630
<font color=#FFFF00>If we were only left with scars after
we broke off our childish relationship</font>

249
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,930
<font color=#FFFF00>it would have been hard to share our
deep thoughts after meeting again, right?</font>

250
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,140
<font color=#FFFF00>That's true.</font>

251
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,370
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's continue being friends...
- No, I'm saying...</font>

252
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:00,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's not draw any lines if we don't
know what will happen in the future.</font>

253
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,200
<font color=#FFFF00>If I don't think it'll work,
I'll leave on my own.</font>

254
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,700
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm old enough to do that much.</font>

255
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,580
<font color=#FFFF00>The same goes for Ro Woon.</font>

256
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,800
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know how much time
you have left together</font>

257
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,200
<font color=#FFFF00>so be with her while you still can.</font>

258
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,300
<font color=#FFFF00>You can still do that for her.</font>

259
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,140
<font color=#FFFF00><i>[YEON JUNG]</i></font>

260
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,220
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I had a date today with Hwan Ki.
It looks like I won today!</i></font>

261
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, Yeon Jung...</font>

262
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she my enemy or is she on my side?</font>

263
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,510
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't figure it out.</font>

264
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:18,770
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The day when snow becomes happiness...</i></font>

265
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:27,030
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The day when snow becomes sadness...</i></font>

266
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,960
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The snow is falling like...</i></font>

267
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:40,140
<font color=#FFFF00><i>like flowers, as it
congratulates us on our love...</i></font>

268
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:02,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Your actions always told me
you were just a fool...</font>

269
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,290
<font color=#FFFF00>This was unexpected.</font>

270
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,840
<font color=#FFFF00>You haven't left yet?</font>

271
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Never mind. You are a fool.</font>

272
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,680
<font color=#FFFF00>After drinking wine with a pretty
and cool woman like Yeon Jung</font>

273
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,290
<font color=#FFFF00>you crawled back in here so quietly.</font>

274
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you playing guitar
all of a sudden? Can you play?</font>

275
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah... a little bit.</font>

276
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,330
<font color=#FFFF00>What about you?</font>

277
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Hand it over.</font>

278
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow.</font>

279
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:07,210
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The chubby, baby pig...</i></font>

280
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:13,150
<font color=#FFFF00><i>He begs for milk, oink, oink, oink...</i></font>

281
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:21,370
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The mother pig comes...</i></font>

282
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,840
<font color=#FFFF00><i>- The baby pig asks for milk...</i>
- What... What is this song?</font>

283
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon? Why? Don't you like it?</font>

284
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,730
<font color=#FFFF00>- I sang it just for you.
- Are you telling me to be the baby pig?</font>

285
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

286
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,360
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, give it to me.</font>

287
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,970
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not the baby pig.</font>

288
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,790
<font color=#FFFF00>I was kidding.</font>

289
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:44,850
<font color=#FFFF00>- Geez, look how chubby they are.
- They're not.</font>

290
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,170
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay, it's my turn.
- Yes.</font>

291
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,410
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not very good either.</font>

292
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:02,630
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I want my warm lips...</i></font>

293
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:08,420
<font color=#FFFF00><i>to touch your soft lips...</i></font>

294
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,020
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I wish for my love...</i></font>

295
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,600
<font color=#FFFF00><i>to reach your heart...</i></font>

296
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:26,210
<font color=#FFFF00><i>If you still haven't realized...</i></font>

297
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:31,550
<font color=#FFFF00><i>my feelings for you...</i></font>

298
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:38,060
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I'll love you more than anyone...</i></font>

299
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,920
<font color=#FFFF00><i>in this world.</i></font>

300
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:48,650
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I'll love you forever...</i></font>

301
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:54,760
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I'll love you just as I love you now...</i></font>

302
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:01,310
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I'll love you more than anyone else...</i></font>

303
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,360
<font color=#FFFF00><i>in this world.</i></font>

304
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh no! You weren't
supposed to see that, CEO Kang!</font>

305
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, well, the truth is...</font>

306
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,770
<font color=#FFFF00>I prepared this song
to sing at your wedding.</font>

307
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Huh? You're leaving again?</font>

308
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't he being too much these days?</font>

309
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:11,720
<font color=#FFFF00>He used to be such an
antisocial and reclusive man.</font>

310
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,000
<font color=#FFFF00>This is strange.</font>

311
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Three years ago...</font>

312
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,750
<font color=#FFFF00>if I had chosen Ji Hye instead of Yi Soo</font>

313
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,520
<font color=#FFFF00>you never would have talked to me again.</font>

314
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,030
<font color=#FFFF00>You were one of my reasons
for not choosing Ji Hye</font>

315
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,360
<font color=#FFFF00>but now, you're protecting
Chae Ro Woon instead of me?</font>

316
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,330
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not telling you to take
all of the responsibility.</font>

317
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,200
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you, we're in this together.</font>

318
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,860
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter what happens...</font>

319
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,420
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be right beside you.</font>

320
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,530
<font color=#FFFF00>As long as you decide
to expose the truth.</font>

321
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,410
<font color=#FFFF00>How much...</font>

322
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,060
<font color=#FFFF00>does Yi Soo know?</font>

323
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything.</font>

324
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Yi Soo...</font>

325
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,820
<font color=#FFFF00>is also hiding something from you.</font>

326
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,450
<font color=#FFFF00>- What is that?
- Let Yi Soo tell you.</font>

327
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:52,420
<font color=#FFFF00>I was the one who covered everything up,
but walk out of those doors yourself.</font>

328
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,760
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you and Yi Soo need to do that.</font>

329
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,410
<font color=#FFFF00>You want me to do it myself?</font>

330
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyhow, I won't tell you
to stay with Yi Soo anymore.</font>

331
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,530
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have asked you to do that.</font>

332
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:11,000
<font color=#FFFF00>I was wrong to think that that was
the best way to protect you and Yi Soo.</font>

333
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,590
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry.</font>

334
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:20,270
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why you don't need
to feel guilty about Yi Soo.</font>

335
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,700
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't deserve Yi Soo.</font>

336
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,790
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what she's hiding</font>

337
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,700
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm sure it's not
as bad as my secret.</font>

338
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,580
<font color=#FFFF00>She knew I betrayed her...</font>

339
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,900
<font color=#FFFF00>and she knew you took the fall for
my faults, but pretended not to know.</font>

340
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,410
<font color=#FFFF00>She just smiled when she was with me.</font>

341
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,680
<font color=#FFFF00>That sounds like Yi Soo.</font>

342
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,570
<font color=#FFFF00>You've suffered for long enough.</font>

343
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's end it here. Okay?</font>

344
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh! This is annoying!</font>

345
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh. When did you get here?</font>

346
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,930
<font color=#FFFF00>My pencils...</font>

347
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:07,010
<font color=#FFFF00>- How did you...
- Wait.</font>

348
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,950
<font color=#FFFF00>I needed to calm down too.</font>

349
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,660
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I tried to copy you.</font>

350
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,010
<font color=#FFFF00>But this is just pissing me off.</font>

351
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Just use a sharpener. Give it to me.</font>

352
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,920
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, wait.</font>

353
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Please teach me how to do it.</font>

354
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:29,450
<font color=#FFFF00>It keeps... doing this.</font>

355
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:35,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, find the correct angle
between the knife and pencil.</font>

356
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,740
<font color=#FFFF00>And push it out smoothly.</font>

357
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Like this?</font>

358
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,070
<font color=#FFFF00>No, no, not like that.
Hold it near the tip</font>

359
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:47,920
<font color=#FFFF00>loosen up your body,
and sharpen it with smooth motions.</font>

360
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,800
<font color=#FFFF00>- Like this.
- I'll loosen up and try it again.</font>

361
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,550
<font color=#FFFF00>- Like this...
- No.</font>

362
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

363
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:08,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Like this. Smoothly.</font>

364
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,100
<font color=#FFFF00>But when did you... get so close?</font>

365
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,180
<font color=#FFFF00>This won't work.</font>

366
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:40,680
<font color=#FFFF00>If we want to draw a line
between us and slow down...</font>

367
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,080
<font color=#FFFF00>- I can only think of one way.
- And what's that?</font>

368
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,770
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll see.</font>

369
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes! Nice!</font>

370
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,610
<font color=#FFFF00>I put it down! Three!
I have eight points!</font>

371
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,020
<font color=#FFFF00>- One go!
- One go?</font>

372
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,150
<font color=#FFFF00>One go!</font>

373
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,980
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't kiss him,
so do it for me instead.</font>

374
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh yeah!</font>

375
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,640
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you, a gambler? Seriously.</font>

376
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,930
<font color=#FFFF00>- Just give it now.
- The score isn't final yet.</font>

377
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,670
<font color=#FFFF00>We need more.</font>

378
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, not good.</font>

379
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh no, I feel so sorry. How pitiful.</font>

380
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Here it is!</font>

381
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Hooray, I'm loving this.</font>

382
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,780
<font color=#FFFF00>I won! I won.</font>

383
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,330
<font color=#FFFF00>As you promised, make my wish come true.</font>

384
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:04,210
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you. It can't
involve taking off clothes.</font>

385
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,370
<font color=#FFFF00>No touching, either.</font>

386
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,760
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't allow any unreasonable wishes.</font>

387
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Do that thing for me.</font>

388
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:19,880
<font color=#FFFF00>What you do alone, early in the morning.</font>

389
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,570
<font color=#FFFF00>What I do alone... early in the morning?</font>

390
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,530
<font color=#FFFF00>- I saw it all.
- You saw it?</font>

391
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

392
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,140
<font color=#FFFF00>It's on!</font>

393
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Start!</font>

394
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,150

<font color=#FFFF00>Come on. What is that?</font>

397
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Do it with more passion.</font>

398
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Do it like you mean it.
You were good last time.</font>

399
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Match? match?</font>

400
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,630
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm tired.</font>

401
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,150
<font color=#FFFF00>My stomach hurts.</font>

403
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,350
<font color=#FFFF00>One second, please.</font>

404
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Woo Il.</font>

405
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,520
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm getting my makeup done.</font>

406
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you come by to
get your hair done, Mr. Groom?</font>

407
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,940
<font color=#FFFF00>You're here?</font>

408
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Yi Soo...</font>

409
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you come with me?</font>

410
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:42,770
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where are we going?
- Well, where should we go?</font>

411
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there any place you've wanted to go?</font>

412
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,290
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

413
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Or something you've wanted to buy?</font>

414
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,650
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to buy you a present.</font>

415
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually, there is one thing I want.</font>

416
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,410
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's just too expensive.</font>

417
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,210
<font color=#FFFF00>That's no problem.</font>

418
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful.</font>

419
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,900
<font color=#FFFF00>- There are no refunds.
- Tell me what it is.</font>

420
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Time with Kang Woo Il.</font>

421
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,850
<font color=#FFFF00>It's usually expensive,
but it's even more expensive to me.</font>

422
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:24,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you stay with me
until the wedding ceremony?</font>

423
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,700
<font color=#FFFF00>That's all I want.</font>

424
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:39,530
<font color=#FFFF00>This means you kidnapped
the bride on her wedding day.</font>

425
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,640
<font color=#FFFF00>But the kidnapper is the groom.</font>

426
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, it's interesting.</font>

427
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, I just remembered
where I want to go.</font>

428
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:52,020
<font color=#FFFF00>- How about an amusement park?
- An amusement park?</font>

429
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,820
<font color=#FFFF00>The playground in my neighborhood?</font>

430
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,220
<font color=#FFFF00>How is this an amusement park?</font>

431
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,510
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to protect your
fractured rib for a month.</font>

432
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,420
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be cold, too.</font>

433
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,020
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a free pass, so keep it on.</font>

434
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,850
<font color=#FFFF00>If you lose it,
you don't get to ride anything.</font>

435
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,460
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the Viking.</font>

436
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,860
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to sit
in the middle or at the end?</font>

437
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,760
<font color=#FFFF00>- I will sit in the middle.
- Middle? Got it.</font>

438
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,180
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome to Woo Il World.</font>

439
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,720
<font color=#FFFF00>The Viking is about to start.</font>

440
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,710
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to think this is the Viking.</font>

441
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:43,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's sit at the end.
All the way at the end!</font>

442
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:48,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, it's too high. Too high.</font>

443
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,880
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a roller coaster.
Can you ride it?</font>

444
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,140
<font color=#FFFF00>You might not be able to.</font>

445
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,240
<font color=#FFFF00>It's fun, but we have no safety bar.</font>

446
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Five, four, three!</font>

447
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Gorilla.</font>

448
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Orangutan? Monkey?</font>

449
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,660
<font color=#FFFF00>- No way.
- Yes, you can do it.</font>

450
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Show me some animals.</font>

451
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,400
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me a piggyback ride.</font>

452
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Grab those.</font>

453
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,420
<font color=#FFFF00>- What for?
- You're too heavy.</font>

454
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,470
<font color=#FFFF00>- This is a carousel.
- This is?</font>

455
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:40,590
<font color=#FFFF00>You grab the bar and
ride back and forth like this.</font>

456
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,660
<font color=#FFFF00>- Feels like a carousel, right?
- No, not at all.</font>

457
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,230
<font color=#FFFF00>If you close you eyes
and do it, you will feel it.</font>

458
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Watch me.</font>

459
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,890
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this now?</font>

460
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:46,420
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the highlight of our date.
Sitting atop a palace.</font>

461
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:05,660
<font color=#FFFF00>This makes me feel like
we're back to being kids.</font>

462
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,940
<font color=#FFFF00>I miss it.</font>

463
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,750
<font color=#FFFF00>I also wish I could
go back to those days.</font>

464
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,890
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why...</font>

465
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:29,680
<font color=#FFFF00>I think we need to draw the line here</font>

466
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,050
<font color=#FFFF00>before anything else happens.</font>

467
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go back.</font>

468
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,030
<font color=#FFFF00>It's almost time for our wedding.</font>

469
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Yi Soo, be careful.</font>

470
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:08,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop pretending you're okay.</font>

471
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:15,120
<font color=#FFFF00>You can stop putting up with...</font>

472
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,360
<font color=#FFFF00>such a coward like me now.</font>

473
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,620
<font color=#FFFF00>You knew what happened...</font>

474
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,970
<font color=#FFFF00>What was going through
your mind all this time?</font>

475
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:34,110
<font color=#FFFF00>It wasn't your fault.</font>

476
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,990
<font color=#FFFF00>I've made a huge mistake
that I can't reverse.</font>

477
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:43,050
<font color=#FFFF00>It affected both you and her.</font>

478
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,520
<font color=#FFFF00>That's true...</font>

479
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:51,300
<font color=#FFFF00>but like you said, if that's
spilled milk and can't be reversed...</font>

480
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,050
<font color=#FFFF00>wouldn't it be better
if we just buried it?</font>

481
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:58,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I told myself the same thing
for the last three years.</font>

482
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,740
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to stop.</font>

483
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:07,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Go home.</font>

484
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,760
<font color=#FFFF00>I will tell your parents everything.</font>

485
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:15,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do that. Don't tell them.</font>

486
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:19,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't say anything...</font>

487
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:23,220
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you.</font>

488
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,770
<font color=#FFFF00>How do I look?</font>

489
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:08,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Your sister's wedding is tonight.</font>

490
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:11,000
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't need to go. Don't go.</font>

491
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:15,180
<font color=#FFFF00>But I even practiced a song for them.</font>

492
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,740
<font color=#FFFF00>It'll be a family gathering.</font>

493
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,050
<font color=#FFFF00>What was that?</font>

494
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:33,330
<font color=#FFFF00>He's telling me to stay out
of his family gathering?</font>

495
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:40,430
<font color=#FFFF00>I even got a wedding present for them.</font>

496
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is this here?</font>

497
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is this here?</font>

498
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,860
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you drawing?</font>

499
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:40,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, it's what this guy
is looking at all the time.</font>

500
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:42,290
<font color=#FFFF00>This guy?</font>

501
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:46,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have a boyfriend now?</font>

502
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:50,460
<font color=#FFFF00>What? No!</font>

503
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:54,630
<font color=#FFFF00>He's just a co-worker.</font>

504
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it CEO Kang?</font>

505
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,090
<font color=#FFFF00>A wedding is a major life event.</font>

506
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,090
<font color=#FFFF00>They just want us to have
a meal together and be done?</font>

507
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,340
<font color=#FFFF00>I just can't accept this.</font>

508
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,070
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the trend to keep
it simple these days.</font>

509
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:30,170
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure it's because of your election.</font>

510
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,090
<font color=#FFFF00>You're all about empty
formalities and vanity like me.</font>

511
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:42,160
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you alone?
Where is Yi Soo?</font>

512
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,780
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, but she won't be coming.</font>

513
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:55,170
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew it. Even you thought a
wedding shouldn't be like this, right?</font>

514
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Yi Soo was trying to be considerate
because you don't have any family.</font>

515
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:00,820
<font color=#FFFF00>But this is a once-in-a-lifetime event.</font>

516
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,290
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not it.</font>

517
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:10,380
<font color=#FFFF00>I... just can't marry Yi Soo.</font>

518
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,660
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you just say?</font>

519
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:20,040
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been deceiving you
with dirty lies up until now.</font>

520
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,590
<font color=#FFFF00>As for the secretary who jumped from
our office building three years ago...</font>

521
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,770
<font color=#FFFF00>the truth is...</font>

522
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:33,050
<font color=#FFFF00>she killed herself because of me.</font>

523
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:37,400
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- What are you talking about?</font>

524
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,820
<font color=#FFFF00>Then it wasn't because of Hwan Ki?</font>

525
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:45,860
<font color=#FFFF00>He took the blame instead of me.</font>

526
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,930
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth did you do to her?</font>

527
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:54,010
<font color=#FFFF00>I... had feelings for her.</font>

528
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:57,840
<font color=#FFFF00>I betrayed Yi Soo and chose her.</font>

529
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:03,080
<font color=#FFFF00>In the end, I betrayed her too.</font>

530
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness...</font>

531
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,060
<font color=#FFFF00>You...</font>

532
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:20,080
<font color=#FFFF00>I will give up everything
you've ever given me and leave.</font>

533
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:28,940
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you?</font>

534
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,870
<font color=#FFFF00>To me, you were...</font>

535
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:39,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for being my family.</font>

536
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:45,380
<font color=#FFFF00>I tried to become someone like you.</font>

537
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:53,470
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't deserve to
become your real family.</font>

538
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,030
<font color=#FFFF00>He gave us such shocking news
and is just leaving now?</font>

539
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:21,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, you're going to
just let him go like that?</font>

540
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:26,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Beat him up or something.
Do what you usually do, Honey.</font>

541
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,920
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey!</font>

542
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my gosh. Seriously.
What's going to happen to Yi Soo?</font>

543
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:03,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Chae Ro Woon.</font>

544
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,010
<font color=#FFFF00>This drawing...</font>

545
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,660
<font color=#FFFF00>My late sister drew this, right?</font>

546
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:29,850
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the late Chae Ji Hye's sister.</font>

547
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:36,600
<font color=#FFFF00>I know that.</font>

548
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually, I was going to come see you...</font>

549
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:43,520
<font color=#FFFF00>What were you two to each other, exactly?</font>

550
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:48,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you love my sister?</font>

551
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:58,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why? Why did she...</font>

552
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:05,960
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth did you do to my sister?</font>

553
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:18,780
<font color=#FFFF00>I have the same necklace.</font>

554
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, do you?</font>

555
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,630
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a special necklace to me.</font>

556
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:30,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go now.</font>

557
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,630
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to see Hwan Ki too...</font>

558
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:47,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you give this necklace to my sister?</font>

559
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:50,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

560
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,830
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no idea...</font>

561
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:03,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I very deeply regret hurting her.</font>

562
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:10,980
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you break up with her?</font>

563
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:16,130
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you break up with her?</font>

564
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:24,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you do it in a
nasty and hurtful way?</font>

565
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,300
<font color=#FFFF00>She was the one I wanted to be with.</font>

566
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:39,310
<font color=#FFFF00>She killed herself because
she thought I dumped her.</font>

567
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:05,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that what happened?</font>

568
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,920
<font color=#FFFF00>You destroyed my family...</font>

569
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:15,220
<font color=#FFFF00>in order to save yours?</font>

570
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:22,040
<font color=#FFFF00>I begged him to do that.</font>

571
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:29,930
<font color=#FFFF00>I told your parents everything.</font>

572
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,570
<font color=#FFFF00>I also told Yi Soo everything earlier.</font>

573
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:37,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you tell her alone?</font>

574
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,480
<font color=#FFFF00>I asked you to do it with me.</font>

575
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,060
<font color=#FFFF00>You've carried everything
on your back alone this whole time.</font>

576
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,420
<font color=#FFFF00>I should do it myself from now on.</font>

577
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,690
<font color=#FFFF00>That's the right thing to do.</font>

578
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:53,740
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where is Yi Soo?
- I dropped her off at the house first.</font>

579
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,560
<font color=#FFFF00>- She might be home...
- Is she alone now?</font>

580
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:03,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Boss.</font>

581
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:21,650
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, but I have to go to her.</font>

582
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Please answer, Yi Soo. Please.</font>

583
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:15,000
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Your call is being redirected...</i></font>

584
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,450
<font color=#FFFF00><i>After you're connected,
you will be charged for the call...</i></font>

585
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,000
<font color=#FFFF00>How?</font>

586
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:55,950
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you? How?</font>

587
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:07,530
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you? How?</font>

588
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:17,320
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you?</font>

589
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:18,860
<font color=#FFFF00><i>[YEON JUNG]</i></font>

590
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:27,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you so uncomfortable?
Is this your first time here?</font>

591
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Come this way.</font>

592
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Sit there.</font>

593
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:39,050
<font color=#FFFF00>You probably didn't eat yet,
so let's eat first.</font>

594
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:56,130
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, but I'm actually
not in the mood for this.</font>

595
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:59,930
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard from Hwan Ki.</font>

596
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:04,430
<font color=#FFFF00>He sent me here.
He asked me to check up on you.</font>

597
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:14,130
<font color=#FFFF00>How did I end up falling for him?</font>

598
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,210
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I want to say, too.</font>

599
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:20,420
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm his so-called "first love."</font>

600
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,430
<font color=#FFFF00>But he's asking his ex-girlfriend
to care for his current girlfriend.</font>

601
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:26,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't he being too harsh on me?</font>

602
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:32,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Good. Just laugh about it.</font>

603
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,180
<font color=#FFFF00>If you want to cry,
just sweat it out instead, okay?</font>

604
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:40,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's eat first though.</font>

605
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:53,020
<font color=#FFFF00>If my sister had seen me,
she'd have been so frustrated.</font>

606
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:57,900
<font color=#FFFF00>I was naive enough
to fall for him briefly.</font>

607
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:03,830
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought the necklace he gave
my sister was a present for me.</font>

608
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,800
<font color=#FFFF00>So I cherished it.</font>

609
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,620
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I'm such a moron.</font>

610
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,660
<font color=#FFFF00>If your sister had seen you</font>

611
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:16,240
<font color=#FFFF00>she'd have said "Good job,"
or, "I'm proud of you, Sis."</font>

612
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,060
<font color=#FFFF00>The truth would have stayed buried
if it hadn't been for you.</font>

613
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Boss was the one who revealed the truth.</font>

614
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:28,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Boss was probably the one
who convinced CEO Kang.</font>

615
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:31,100
<font color=#FFFF00>But you don't resent Hwan Ki, eh?</font>

616
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,460
<font color=#FFFF00>He chose to protect
his sister three years ago.</font>

617
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,720
<font color=#FFFF00>And this time he walked away
from you to go to his sister instead.</font>

618
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Why wouldn't I? I hate him for that.</font>

619
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:49,520
<font color=#FFFF00>But I have a feeling
that he had a good reason.</font>

620
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:53,530
<font color=#FFFF00>In fact, that's what scares me.</font>

621
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:59,510
<font color=#FFFF00>This might not be the end of it.</font>

622
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:05,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if I let myself inside the door,
there will be another door to stop me.</font>

623
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:08,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Honestly, Hwan Ki is like that.</font>

624
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,760
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how hard you try,
you're never really close to him.</font>

625
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,050
<font color=#FFFF00>When you think you've figured him out,
he keeps turning into somebody else.</font>

626
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:21,110
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not easy to love such a person.</font>

627
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:29,360
<font color=#FFFF00>Right about now, you should
try to attack me again</font>

628
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,910
<font color=#FFFF00>saying I should let you take him.</font>

629
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:34,930
<font color=#FFFF00>You know me so well.</font>

630
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:38,500
<font color=#FFFF00>To a tiny little kiddo,
he's a very difficult man.</font>

631
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:11,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, Yeon Jung.</font>

632
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:53,700
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're going to throw it away,
can you give it to me?</font>

633
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:22,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I see the list of visitors?</font>

634
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,710
<font color=#FFFF00>You're CEO Eun, aren't you?</font>

635
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:25,800
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I help you?</font>

636
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:30,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Yi Soo come here, by any chance?</font>

637
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:33,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, she just went upstairs.</font>

638
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,380
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually, that necklace...</font>

639
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,860
<font color=#FFFF00>should've been given to me.</font>

640
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:56,020
<font color=#FFFF00>You look like you know what happened.</font>

641
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you feeling better now?</font>

642
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:17,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Your late sister still
took Kang Woo Il away...</font>

643
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,280
<font color=#FFFF00>even after her death.</font>

644
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:25,190
<font color=#FFFF00>I know that you're a victim, too.</font>

645
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:33,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Chae Ji Hye...</font>

646
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,510
<font color=#FFFF00>I killed her.</font>

647
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't blame Kang Woo Il.</font>

648
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:43,810
<font color=#FFFF00>He's innocent.</font>

649
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,610
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

650
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying...</font>

651
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:57,190
<font color=#FFFF00>that my sister... didn't kill herself?</font>

652
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:00,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay back.</font>

653
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:09,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I just wanted to take back what was mine.</font>

654
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:29,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be scared.</font>

655
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:33,440
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't hurt anyone.</font>

656
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Because there is only...</font>

657
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,430
<font color=#FFFF00>one person I want to hurt.</font>

658
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:52,940
<font color=#FFFF00>No!</font>

659
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:56,530
<font color=#FFFF00>- No, you can't!
- You're putting yourself in danger!</font>

660
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,280
<font color=#FFFF00>- Don't do this!
- Let go of me!</font>

661
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,900
<font color=#FFFF00>I killed your sister!</font>

662
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,640
<font color=#FFFF00>So I will kill myself,
just like how she did!</font>

663
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go of me!</font>
