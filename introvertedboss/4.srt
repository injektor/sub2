<font color="yellow">She left without her shoes.</font>

2
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,601
<font color="yellow">She wasn't even wearing any shoes...</font>

3
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,000
<font color="yellow">when she was...</font>

4
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,790
<font color="yellow">going...</font>

5
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,900
<font color="yellow">so far away.</font>

<font color="yellow">(Episode 4: I Won't Meet Anyone)</font>

7
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:13,000
<font color="yellow">(Episode 4: I Won't Meet Anyone)</font>

8
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:18,612
<font color="yellow">It's still dark outside because the sun isn't up yet.</font>

9
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,352
<font color="yellow">Where does he wander at this early hour?</font>

10
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:25,378
<font color="yellow">He rarely leaves the penthouse,</font>

11
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:29,578
<font color="yellow">but it looks like he goes somewhere every morning.</font>

12
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:34,348
<font color="yellow">I think he's obsessive about repeating his morning routine.</font>

13
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:36,378
<font color="yellow">He takes a shower,</font>

14
00:03:37,118 --> 00:03:38,248
<font color="yellow">cleans,</font>

15
00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:42,178
<font color="yellow">sharpens his pencils,</font>

16
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,078
<font color="yellow">puts on some music,</font>

17
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:50,248
<font color="yellow">and dances.</font>

18
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:51,918
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

19
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:53,548
<font color="yellow">He dances?</font>

20
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:42,578
<font color="yellow">What was that? Was that a hallucination?</font>

21
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,348
<font color="yellow">Am I still half asleep?</font>

22
00:04:56,748 --> 00:04:58,318
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

23
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:07,148
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

24
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:15,518
<font color="yellow">There's no way he was dancing.</font>

25
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:19,678
<font color="yellow">That cold psychopath never even says hi back.</font>

26
00:05:22,818 --> 00:05:24,018
<font color="yellow">Did she see it?</font>

27
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:27,818
<font color="yellow">Let's have lunch.</font>

28
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:31,248
<font color="yellow">What will we be having today? Will it be pork cutlets?</font>

29
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,318
<font color="yellow">- Hurry. - Let's go.</font>

30
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:33,878
<font color="yellow">It's yukgaejang today.</font>

31
00:05:34,218 --> 00:05:36,948
<font color="yellow">- It's yukgaejang every day. - I had it yesterday.</font>

32
00:05:37,948 --> 00:05:39,318
<font color="yellow">Should we eat out?</font>

33
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:44,818
<font color="yellow">He never eats with his employees.</font>

34
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:50,418
<font color="yellow">It seems like he does eat by himself.</font>

35
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:54,418
<font color="yellow">Whatever he eats, the kitchen is always cleaned up.</font>

36
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:56,218
<font color="yellow">There's no smell, either.</font>

37
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:59,918
<font color="yellow">There must be some traces left.</font>

38
00:06:02,748 --> 00:06:03,818
<font color="yellow">I found it.</font>

39
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:17,518
<font color="yellow">Does it smell like kimchi?</font>

40
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:19,848
<font color="yellow">- Good work today. - Good work, everyone.</font>

41
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:21,678
<font color="yellow">- See you tomorrow. - See you.</font>

42
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:25,918
<font color="yellow">It's so cold these days.</font>

43
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:27,778
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

44
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:34,378
<font color="yellow">After everyone leaves,</font>

45
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:36,948
<font color="yellow">what does he do here all alone?</font>

46
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:40,148
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow morning, he'll sneak out again...</font>

47
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:42,478
<font color="yellow">like a cockroach.</font>

48
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:57,878
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

49
00:07:21,948 --> 00:07:23,118
<font color="yellow">He exercises?</font>

50
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:34,248
<font color="yellow">He's surprisingly good.</font>

51
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:38,378
<font color="yellow">I thought he was a loner who never gets out.</font>

52
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:42,078
<font color="yellow">Nice.</font>

53
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:48,848
<font color="yellow">What a surprise!</font>

54
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:50,118
<font color="yellow">You're very good.</font>

55
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:51,818
<font color="yellow">It's so unexpected.</font>

56
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:53,548
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

57
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:54,948
<font color="yellow">I'm here to work out.</font>

58
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:56,978
<font color="yellow">Are you a member here, too?</font>

59
00:07:57,548 --> 00:07:59,218
<font color="yellow">It's so nice to see you here.</font>

60
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:04,078
<font color="yellow">Are you leaving?</font>

61
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:08,548
<font color="yellow">I actually want to learn how to play squash. Can you teach me?</font>

62
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:11,518
<font color="yellow">Why are you ignoring me?</font>

63
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:14,018
<font color="yellow">I'm just happy to run into you.</font>

64
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:18,418
<font color="yellow">Isn't it about time we became closer?</font>

65
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,178
<font color="yellow">Let's work out together...</font>

66
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:22,978
<font color="yellow">and drink something cold together later.</font>

67
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:28,518
<font color="yellow">I work out alone.</font>

68
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,478
<font color="yellow">Of course you do.</font>

69
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:48,978
<font color="yellow">Is it about Ms. Chae again?</font>

70
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:53,888
<font color="yellow">If she makes you that uncomfortable, she'll have to go.</font>

71
00:08:54,448 --> 00:08:56,548
<font color="yellow">- I'll take her then. - What?</font>

72
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:58,548
<font color="yellow">I want to teach her a lot.</font>

73
00:08:58,648 --> 00:09:00,718
<font color="yellow">- I'll keep her near me and... - You can't do that.</font>

74
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:04,578
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

75
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,548
<font color="yellow">I'd like to...</font>

76
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,418
<font color="yellow">kick her out of the company for good.</font>

77
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,478
<font color="yellow">- If she stays here, she'll... - What?</font>

78
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:16,218
<font color="yellow">She'll get on my nerves.</font>

79
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:19,078
<font color="yellow">You can't fire someone because of that.</font>

80
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:21,318
<font color="yellow">You know we can't fire people that easily.</font>

81
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:25,078
<font color="yellow">The ministry is keeping an eye on us after the power abuse issue.</font>

82
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:29,848
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Hwan Gi.</font>

83
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:34,218
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she's been sticking around you because of me.</font>

84
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:36,018
<font color="yellow">I told her to do that.</font>

85
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:39,518
<font color="yellow">It was an assignment regarding the PI project.</font>

86
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:42,078
<font color="yellow">I told her to analyze what kind of person you are.</font>

87
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:47,018
<font color="yellow">She's observing whatever you do with affection.</font>

88
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:51,248
<font color="yellow">Stop being so cold and treat her nicely.</font>

89
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:52,888
<font color="yellow">With affection?</font>

90
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:00,448
<font color="yellow">Why is this so funny to me?</font>

91
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:02,548
<font color="yellow">She's giving you such a hard time.</font>

92
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:04,918
<font color="yellow">Eun Hwan Gi has met his perfect match.</font>

93
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:08,548
<font color="yellow">It all starts from hating each other.</font>

94
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:11,748
<font color="yellow">Give it some time, and tell me if it's still too hard for you.</font>

95
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,888
<font color="yellow">I'll be more than happy to take her.</font>

96
00:10:15,618 --> 00:10:17,978
<font color="yellow">No. She can stay with me.</font>

97
00:10:21,948 --> 00:10:24,478
<font color="yellow">What I mean is...</font>

98
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:28,348
<font color="yellow">What you mean is...</font>

99
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:36,178
<font color="yellow">We have no choice. Just let her stay.</font>

100
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:06,778
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang.</font>

101
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:08,578
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

102
00:11:08,678 --> 00:11:11,748
<font color="yellow">I've been waiting for you. Let's go.</font>

103
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:34,778
<font color="yellow">They're together again.</font>

104
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:37,478
<font color="yellow">Where are they going together?</font>

105
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,448
<font color="yellow">I've finished my assignment.</font>

106
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,048
<font color="yellow">You have?</font>

107
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:45,478
<font color="yellow">Where's your report paper?</font>

108
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:48,178
<font color="yellow">I didn't have much to write about.</font>

109
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:50,378
<font color="yellow">Mr. Eun can be...</font>

110
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,218
<font color="yellow">defined with one word.</font>

111
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:55,948
<font color="yellow">I'm all ears.</font>

112
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,318
<font color="yellow">A cockroach.</font>

113
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,518
<font color="yellow">A cockroach?</font>

114
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:03,518
<font color="yellow">Late at night, when everyone's asleep and no one is watching,</font>

115
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:06,678
<font color="yellow">he becomes active.</font>

116
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,178
<font color="yellow">He's always dressed in back, too.</font>

117
00:12:09,718 --> 00:12:11,318
<font color="yellow">He's just like a cockroach.</font>

118
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:16,118
<font color="yellow">He never gives any instructions,</font>

119
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:18,318
<font color="yellow">or hold any meetings.</font>

120
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:21,748
<font color="yellow">He only spends the hard earned money his employees make.</font>

121
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,748
<font color="yellow">Silent Monster is like an empty shell.</font>

122
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:32,318
<font color="yellow">It's all just a show to pretend the abusive boss has changed.</font>

123
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:34,348
<font color="yellow">That's harsh.</font>

124
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:38,878
<font color="yellow">All his employees are anxious.</font>

125
00:12:39,818 --> 00:12:43,218
<font color="yellow">They wonder if it's really okay to be doing nothing.</font>

126
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:46,478
<font color="yellow">At least, you're working hard.</font>

127
00:12:46,878 --> 00:12:48,978
<font color="yellow">I don't do much.</font>

128
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:53,118
<font color="yellow">I just follow you around, have good food,</font>

129
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:54,678
<font color="yellow">and meet people.</font>

130
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:57,748
<font color="yellow">Do you think we meet people just to have fun?</font>

131
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,048
<font color="yellow">Giving presentations is a big part of PR agencies' jobs.</font>

132
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:04,978
<font color="yellow">It's, in essence, meeting people and persuading them...</font>

133
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:06,618
<font color="yellow">to get on our side.</font>

134
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:10,478
<font color="yellow">I believe knowing a good person is a lot more important than...</font>

135
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:13,548
<font color="yellow">reading a book both for your work and for your life.</font>

136
00:13:15,218 --> 00:13:19,378
<font color="yellow">Today, an executive of a major food company will be here.</font>

137
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,378
<font color="yellow">For the 30th anniversary project of Yong Ramyeon,</font>

138
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:23,248
<font color="yellow">there will be a bidding soon.</font>

139
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:25,118
<font color="yellow">Do you understand what I mean?</font>

140
00:13:26,678 --> 00:13:29,478
<font color="yellow">Are we bribing him?</font>

141
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:33,148
<font color="yellow">We're just asking him to let us enter the competition.</font>

142
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:35,978
<font color="yellow">You'll soon figure it out,</font>

143
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:38,448
<font color="yellow">but they're not corrupt people.</font>

144
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:45,378
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang, you're already here.</font>

145
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:47,518
<font color="yellow">Hello, Managing Director Jin.</font>

146
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:49,178
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

147
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:52,548
<font color="yellow">Who is this beauty? Is she your girlfriend?</font>

148
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:55,418
<font color="yellow">She's an employee I think very highly of.</font>

149
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:56,818
<font color="yellow">She's my secret weapon.</font>

150
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:01,218
<font color="yellow">I'm Chae Ro Woon.</font>

151
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:02,748
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you.</font>

152
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:04,678
<font color="yellow">Please take a seat.</font>

153
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:07,118
<font color="yellow">Sure. Let's sit down.</font>

154
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:10,578
<font color="yellow">He was supposed to pass the ball to his team,</font>

155
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:13,278
<font color="yellow">but he ended up scoring an own goal.</font>

156
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:14,348
<font color="yellow">That's so funny.</font>

<font color="yellow">If he hates it so much...</font>

313
00:23:41,978 --> 00:23:43,148
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr. Jin.</font>

314
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:46,248
<font color="yellow">About the meeting tomorrow...</font>

315
00:23:46,648 --> 00:23:49,478
<font color="yellow">What do you think about going early in the morning?</font>

316
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,578
<font color="yellow">Boss, you're here.</font>

317
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:09,478
<font color="yellow">Managing Director Jin is a member here as well.</font>

318
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:14,118
<font color="yellow">It looks like Silent Monster...</font>

319
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:17,018
<font color="yellow">is fated to work with Yong Ramyeon. Don't you think?</font>

320
00:24:17,018 --> 00:24:18,748
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're...</font>

321
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:26,548
<font color="yellow">I always wondered who came here earlier than me.</font>

322
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:27,778
<font color="yellow">It was you.</font>

323
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:30,618
<font color="yellow">Let me introduce you.</font>

324
00:24:31,148 --> 00:24:32,948
<font color="yellow">This is Managing Director Jin of Yong Ramyeon.</font>

325
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:36,778
<font color="yellow">This is Silent Monster's boss, Eun Hwan Gi.</font>

326
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,418
<font color="yellow">Say hello.</font>

327
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:42,948
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

328
00:24:43,578 --> 00:24:45,518
<font color="yellow">You should greet each other.</font>

329
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:46,518
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

330
00:24:46,948 --> 00:24:49,718
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang told me about you.</font>

331
00:24:58,778 --> 00:25:00,948
<font color="yellow">It's nice and cool. Drink up.</font>

332
00:25:01,318 --> 00:25:03,578
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you. Right.</font>

333
00:25:04,078 --> 00:25:05,948
<font color="yellow">I heard you're pretty good at squash.</font>

334
00:25:05,948 --> 00:25:08,278
<font color="yellow">No, not really. I'm not good.</font>

335
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:10,848
<font color="yellow">He's seriously so good.</font>

336
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,348
<font color="yellow">He's a pro.</font>

337
00:25:12,518 --> 00:25:13,818
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

338
00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:16,578
<font color="yellow">Let's play a game.</font>

339
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:20,648
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I like to exercise alone.</font>

340
00:25:20,748 --> 00:25:24,118
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why? There's no fun in playing against a wall by yourself.</font>

341
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:26,778
<font color="yellow">She's saying you're good. Teach me.</font>

342
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:28,648
<font color="yellow">When someone's looking at me...</font>

343
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:30,778
<font color="yellow">I always make mistakes.</font>

344
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:33,548
<font color="yellow">Mistakes? That's totally fine.</font>

345
00:25:33,648 --> 00:25:35,178
<font color="yellow">Mistakes are what makes us human.</font>

346
00:25:35,178 --> 00:25:37,418
<font color="yellow">All right. Come on. Let's play a game, okay?</font>

347
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:41,048
<font color="yellow">I'll take this.</font>

348
00:25:44,518 --> 00:25:45,718
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

349
00:25:46,418 --> 00:25:48,078
<font color="yellow">Here. Take this.</font>

350
00:25:48,418 --> 00:25:49,848
<font color="yellow">I clearly said I don't want to do this.</font>

351
00:25:50,778 --> 00:25:54,018
<font color="yellow">I'll be a referee.</font>

352
00:25:56,548 --> 00:25:57,678
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

353
00:25:59,248 --> 00:26:01,348
<font color="yellow">Allow me to serve since I'm older than you.</font>

354
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,578
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Why aren't you playing?</font>

355
00:26:08,978 --> 00:26:11,018
<font color="yellow">It's 1 to 0!</font>

356
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:13,648
<font color="yellow">Yes. Right.</font>

357
00:26:14,478 --> 00:26:15,678
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

358
00:26:24,678 --> 00:26:26,678
<font color="yellow">It's 2 to 0!</font>

359
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,078
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now? Do you think I'm a joke?</font>

360
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:30,778
<font color="yellow">You don't even want to deal with me?</font>

361
00:26:31,348 --> 00:26:33,818
<font color="yellow">I think my staff was a bit overly driven...</font>

362
00:26:33,948 --> 00:26:36,348
<font color="yellow">to get Yong Ramyeon's 30th anniversary project.</font>

363
00:26:37,348 --> 00:26:39,048
<font color="yellow">This is not how I get things done.</font>

364
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:44,148
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

365
00:26:45,518 --> 00:26:48,978
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at the bidding with our proposal.</font>

366
00:26:49,078 --> 00:26:50,378
<font color="yellow">Just a second.</font>

367
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,818
<font color="yellow">I see that you're good at making a fool out of people.</font>

368
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:57,578
<font color="yellow">Tell me. Did I ask you to dance around in underwear for me?</font>

369
00:26:57,678 --> 00:27:00,048
<font color="yellow">Or did I ask you for money?</font>

370
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:02,848
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to play a game of squash with you.</font>

371
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:07,048
<font color="yellow">Definitely. My boss must've misunderstood something.</font>

372
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:10,318
<font color="yellow">Did you misunderstand my intentions, Ms. Chae?</font>

373
00:27:10,548 --> 00:27:13,448
<font color="yellow">You asked me to come here at this early hour.</font>

374
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:15,618
<font color="yellow">And why did you show up with your boss?</font>

375
00:27:15,678 --> 00:27:19,378
<font color="yellow">- Do you have a hidden agenda? - Not at all.</font>

376
00:27:19,378 --> 00:27:22,218
<font color="yellow">Then you hold this racquet...</font>

377
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:23,948
<font color="yellow">and tell this guy to leave!</font>

378
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:26,948
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

379
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:28,618
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

380
00:27:30,218 --> 00:27:32,078
<font color="yellow">I've always wanted to learn how to play squash.</font>

381
00:27:32,078 --> 00:27:33,278
<font color="yellow">Will you teach me?</font>

382
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:34,648
<font color="yellow">I'm a fast learner.</font>

383
00:27:35,478 --> 00:27:36,878
<font color="yellow">Please give it to me. Thank you.</font>

384
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:38,818
<font color="yellow">- Like this? - All right. Yes.</font>

385
00:27:38,818 --> 00:27:41,548
<font color="yellow">Don't move your whole upper body when you swing the racquet.</font>

386
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:42,848
<font color="yellow">Hold it like this...</font>

387
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:46,148
<font color="yellow">- and do this. That's it. - Like this?</font>

388
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:50,618
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's play a game.</font>

389
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:53,218
<font color="yellow">What? You're still here?</font>

390
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:54,778
<font color="yellow">Ro Woon, get out. I'll do it.</font>

391
00:27:54,978 --> 00:27:56,578
<font color="yellow">Swing the racquet like this.</font>

392
00:27:57,348 --> 00:28:00,748
<font color="yellow">You're so stiff. Relax your shoulders, okay? Good.</font>

393
00:28:01,118 --> 00:28:02,348
<font color="yellow">All right, give it a try.</font>

394
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,151
<font color="yellow">You're so tense.</font>

395
00:28:04,176 --> 00:28:05,778
<font color="yellow">You'll get hurt like this.</font>

396
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:07,918
<font color="yellow">All right. Relax your body first.</font>

397
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,948
<font color="yellow">My gosh, why is your upper body so mushy?</font>

398
00:28:11,948 --> 00:28:13,518
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't exercise your upper body.</font>

399
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:15,948
<font color="yellow">I mean, I saw how flexible your legs are.</font>

400
00:28:16,454 --> 00:28:19,054
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, your body is so mushy... - Please, Mr. Jin...</font>

401
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:45,036
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

402
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:47,566
<font color="yellow">I make mistakes when someone is looking at me.</font>

403
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:53,236
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

404
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:11,166
<font color="yellow">My gosh. I'm so sorry. This might help relieve the pain...</font>

405
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:17,206
<font color="yellow">I sincerely apologize. Are you...</font>

406
00:29:19,306 --> 00:29:20,466
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sue him.</font>

407
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:23,206
<font color="yellow">He obviously did it intentionally to hurt me.</font>

408
00:29:23,606 --> 00:29:25,006
<font color="yellow">I absolutely won't settle.</font>

409
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:28,936
<font color="yellow">Things just got a little intense while you were exercising.</font>

410
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:30,836
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

411
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:33,206
<font color="yellow">Take a look at my CT and MRI scans when they're out.</font>

412
00:29:33,536 --> 00:29:35,206
<font color="yellow">It was definitely more than "a little intense".</font>

413
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:38,236
<font color="yellow">Please don't get so worked up.</font>

414
00:29:39,336 --> 00:29:41,506
<font color="yellow">While collecting statements about the incident,</font>

415
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:45,406
<font color="yellow">the fact that you were hitting on our employee will be revealed.</font>

416
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:48,506
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

417
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:53,836
<font color="yellow">My apologies. I got a little worked up there.</font>

418
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:55,536
<font color="yellow">She's an employee I think very highly of.</font>

419
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:58,066
<font color="yellow">I take it that you don't want to work with me.</font>

420
00:29:58,636 --> 00:30:00,136
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

421
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:07,466
<font color="yellow">This is for your hospital expenses.</font>

422
00:30:15,366 --> 00:30:17,206
<font color="yellow">Please forgive him, and don't turn it into a big deal...</font>

423
00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:19,006
<font color="yellow">for my sake.</font>

424
00:30:35,906 --> 00:30:37,106
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

425
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:39,236
<font color="yellow">Does he not want us to participate in the bidding?</font>

426
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:42,366
<font color="yellow">I managed to get his permission for the presentation.</font>

427
00:30:44,566 --> 00:30:46,506
<font color="yellow">You didn't even do anything wrong,</font>

428
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:48,936
<font color="yellow">but you had to apologize to him.</font>

429
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,236
<font color="yellow">This is nothing.</font>

430
00:30:51,736 --> 00:30:52,866
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

431
00:31:03,836 --> 00:31:05,066
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

432
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:09,406
<font color="yellow">Hey, how can you say that when I did all that work to sort it out?</font>

433
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:13,866
<font color="yellow">I don't want to work with someone like that.</font>

434
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:16,036
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to tell you this,</font>

435
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,006
<font color="yellow">but you're not in any position to be picky at the moment.</font>

436
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:21,366
<font color="yellow">You should be asking companies to work with you.</font>

437
00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:23,106
<font color="yellow">He's obviously expecting something more than that.</font>

438
00:31:23,106 --> 00:31:25,566
<font color="yellow">He won't evaluate our presentation fairly.</font>

439
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:27,666
<font color="yellow">Let's just give it a try.</font>

440
00:31:27,806 --> 00:31:29,806
<font color="yellow">For our employees' sake. No.</font>

441
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:32,036
<font color="yellow">For my sake.</font>

442
00:31:35,036 --> 00:31:36,336
<font color="yellow">There you go again.</font>

443
00:31:39,136 --> 00:31:41,106
<font color="yellow">Cut him some slack for my sake.</font>

444
00:31:41,306 --> 00:31:45,366
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim, please hang in there for my sake.</font>

445
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:47,466
<font color="yellow">Please forgive him, and don't turn it into a big deal...</font>

446
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,536
<font color="yellow">for my sake.</font>

447
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:51,066
<font color="yellow">"For my sake."</font>

448
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:54,166
<font color="yellow">He makes it sound like he's sacrificing himself.</font>

449
00:31:54,466 --> 00:31:56,066
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang, please look at this camera.</font>

450
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:59,506
<font color="yellow">But he's also unwittingly expressing his desire for attention.</font>

451
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:02,206
<font color="yellow">The right side of my face looks better on camera.</font>

452
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:04,006
<font color="yellow">Please take photos of my better side.</font>

453
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,136
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying enjoying attention is bad.</font>

454
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:09,136
<font color="yellow">- What does Silent Monster mean? - It's just that I'm not like him.</font>

455
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:11,866
<font color="yellow">I've been wholeheartedly thankful that he always...</font>

456
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:14,966
<font color="yellow">volunteers to be in the spotlight on my behalf.</font>

457
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,966
<font color="yellow">- We just took the first step, - But...</font>

458
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:19,636
<font color="yellow">so please show us your support and look forward to it.</font>

459
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:21,906
<font color="yellow">You once said that Mr. Eun stays behind the scenes...</font>

460
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:24,936
<font color="yellow">because you're more handsome than him. Is that true?</font>

461
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,206
<font color="yellow">You haven't met Mr. Eun in person, have you?</font>

462
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:30,236

00:43:00,436 --> 00:43:03,936
<font color="yellow">No one from her work came, and they won't meet with us.</font>

617
00:43:03,936 --> 00:43:06,036
<font color="yellow">They finally came to us. Why would you send him back?</font>

618
00:43:06,766 --> 00:43:08,336
<font color="yellow">Take it and leave.</font>

619
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:15,906
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Dad?</font>

620
00:43:16,306 --> 00:43:17,906
<font color="yellow">Are you just going to sit there?</font>

621
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,266
<font color="yellow">Social life is hard for everyone.</font>

622
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:25,266
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

623
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:28,366
<font color="yellow">Everyone struggles, but they continue to power through.</font>

624
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,006
<font color="yellow">She should have done the same.</font>

625
00:43:34,036 --> 00:43:35,266
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

626
00:43:40,406 --> 00:43:43,066
<font color="yellow">If you won't do it, I will.</font>

627
00:43:43,606 --> 00:43:46,706
<font color="yellow">I will go and get at least Ji Hye's shoes back.</font>

628
00:43:47,466 --> 00:43:49,336
<font color="yellow">Stop making a scene and sit down.</font>

629
00:43:50,206 --> 00:43:52,336
<font color="yellow">I can't do that!</font>

630
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,906
<font color="yellow">My heart is about to burst.</font>

631
00:44:41,466 --> 00:44:44,966
<font color="yellow">(I'll wait for your return to the stage.)</font>

632
00:44:49,236 --> 00:44:51,066
<font color="yellow">(I'll wait for your return to the stage.)</font>

633
00:45:21,406 --> 00:45:22,606
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

634
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:25,366
<font color="yellow">Mom. He's here.</font>

635
00:45:25,536 --> 00:45:28,336
<font color="yellow">What? He's here? What's gotten into him?</font>

636
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:31,466
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'm here.</font>

637
00:45:32,136 --> 00:45:35,166
<font color="yellow">It's you, Woo Il.</font>

638
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,706
<font color="yellow">I thought it was Hwan Gi.</font>

639
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:39,266
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you change the way you call Woo Il?</font>

640
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,136
<font color="yellow">We didn't even get married yet.</font>

641
00:45:41,136 --> 00:45:42,966
<font color="yellow">Although you haven't had a wedding yet,</font>

642
00:45:43,066 --> 00:45:44,966
<font color="yellow">you're living together.</font>

643
00:45:45,066 --> 00:45:48,366
<font color="yellow">I'll call you Mother after we get married, too.</font>

644
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:50,666
<font color="yellow">That will be confusing.</font>

645
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:53,466
<font color="yellow">When you have kids, things will become even more complicated.</font>

646
00:45:54,006 --> 00:45:56,936
<font color="yellow">I was worried it might give you a headache, so I got you something.</font>

647
00:45:57,766 --> 00:46:01,006
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Woo Il.</font>

648
00:46:01,006 --> 00:46:02,266
<font color="yellow">You're the best.</font>

649
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:06,836
<font color="yellow">You've been whining all day. Now you smile.</font>

650
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:09,536
<font color="yellow">That's because Woo Il is here.</font>

651
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,836
<font color="yellow">Mother, aren't you tired? Let me give you a massage.</font>

652
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,006
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure? - Can you lift your legs?</font>

653
00:46:13,436 --> 00:46:15,536
<font color="yellow">You're the best.</font>

654
00:46:16,236 --> 00:46:17,366
<font color="yellow">Did you have dinner?</font>

655
00:46:17,366 --> 00:46:18,736
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

656
00:46:18,736 --> 00:46:20,166
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

657
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:23,336
<font color="yellow">Hwan Gi hasn't come home for days. I'm on a strike.</font>

658
00:46:23,436 --> 00:46:25,836
<font color="yellow">I'll tell him to come home.</font>

659
00:46:25,836 --> 00:46:27,266
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Yes.</font>

660
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:31,866
<font color="yellow">It feels so nice.</font>

661
00:46:43,289 --> 00:46:44,549
<font color="yellow">We're in trouble.</font>

662
00:46:46,748 --> 00:46:50,218
<font color="yellow">Yoo Hee just called, and she's still home.</font>

663
00:46:52,048 --> 00:46:53,918
<font color="yellow">She woke up late.</font>

664
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:58,548
<font color="yellow">Let me call her.</font>

665
00:46:59,748 --> 00:47:01,218
<font color="yellow">Why isn't there anything else to wear?</font>

666
00:47:02,348 --> 00:47:03,418
<font color="yellow">It's suffocating.</font>

667
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:05,818
<font color="yellow">Is this not going to fit?</font>

668
00:47:05,818 --> 00:47:07,718
<font color="yellow">(Ro Woon)</font>

669
00:47:11,388 --> 00:47:12,688
<font color="yellow">Hi, Ro Woon.</font>

670
00:47:12,818 --> 00:47:16,588
<font color="yellow">This is an unexpected chance to take revenge.</font>

671
00:47:21,118 --> 00:47:23,348
<font color="yellow">I don't think she'll get here in time.</font>

672
00:47:24,748 --> 00:47:26,488
<font color="yellow">Do you want to talk to her?</font>

673
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,419
<font color="yellow">I just gave my kids their pills.</font>

674
00:47:31,588 --> 00:47:32,748
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

675
00:47:35,648 --> 00:47:37,988
<font color="yellow">Why are you throwing it back up?</font>

676
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,448
<font color="yellow">It's too bitter.</font>

677
00:47:39,548 --> 00:47:42,248
<font color="yellow">Wait. Don't throw up.</font>

678
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,918
<font color="yellow">Swallow it. There you go.</font>

679
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:03,588
<font color="yellow">Wait. Where are you going?</font>

680
00:48:03,588 --> 00:48:05,588
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

681
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:09,618
<font color="yellow">You should give the presentation.</font>

682
00:48:10,118 --> 00:48:11,988
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

683
00:48:11,988 --> 00:48:14,288
<font color="yellow">Do you expect us to do it?</font>

684
00:48:14,448 --> 00:48:16,588
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who can do it.</font>

685
00:48:16,948 --> 00:48:20,488
<font color="yellow">Silent Monster, everyone is waiting. Please hurry.</font>

686
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:23,688
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

687
00:48:24,048 --> 00:48:27,148
<font color="yellow">I'm not dressed properly.</font>

688
00:48:28,118 --> 00:48:29,548
<font color="yellow">- Also... - No.</font>

689
00:48:29,648 --> 00:48:32,348
<font color="yellow">Your progressive style makes you look creative.</font>

690
00:48:32,888 --> 00:48:33,988
<font color="yellow">It's perfect.</font>

691
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,018
<font color="yellow">The hidden emperor under the veil.</font>

692
00:48:38,018 --> 00:48:41,288
<font color="yellow">The glorious debut of the mysterious Eun Hwan Gi.</font>

693
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:44,318
<font color="yellow">This is a perfect opportunity to make a name for yourself.</font>

694
00:48:45,648 --> 00:48:47,288
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

695
00:48:49,748 --> 00:48:51,418
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

696
00:48:52,688 --> 00:48:54,248
<font color="yellow">Show them what you've got.</font>

697
00:48:54,248 --> 00:48:56,118
<font color="yellow">Neat hands.</font>

698
00:48:56,118 --> 00:48:58,888
<font color="yellow">Stylish hair.</font>

699
00:48:58,888 --> 00:49:00,088
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

700
00:49:01,518 --> 00:49:03,448
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

701
00:49:03,988 --> 00:49:05,148
<font color="yellow">We should go, too.</font>

702
00:49:28,148 --> 00:49:30,548
<font color="yellow">Sorry. Sorry, we're late.</font>

703
00:49:31,118 --> 00:49:32,248
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

704
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:38,318
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

705
00:49:39,418 --> 00:49:41,388
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

706
00:49:44,788 --> 00:49:45,918
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

707
00:49:50,348 --> 00:49:53,948
<font color="yellow">Now, Silent Monster will...</font>

708
00:49:53,948 --> 00:49:55,788
<font color="yellow">give a presentation.</font>

709
00:49:56,188 --> 00:49:58,918
<font color="yellow">Please start the presentation.</font>

710
00:50:00,018 --> 00:50:03,048
<font color="yellow">What if he does a good job?</font>

711
00:50:08,618 --> 00:50:11,388
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, please start.</font>

712
00:50:13,518 --> 00:50:16,418
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - What is he doing?</font>

713

<font color="yellow">Excuse me, what are you waiting for?</font>

714
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,088
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

720

<font color="yellow">Well, I'm...</font>

721
00:51:01,888 --> 00:51:05,248
<font color="yellow">- I'm... - Speak!</font>

722
00:51:10,218 --> 00:51:12,448
<font color="yellow">Speak! Come on!</font>

723
00:51:13,548 --> 00:51:14,918
<font color="yellow">Speak!</font>

724
00:51:19,388 --> 00:51:22,248
<font color="yellow">Just do whatever you want.</font>

725
00:51:24,688 --> 00:51:26,888
<font color="yellow">Is that all you can say?</font>

726
00:51:27,788 --> 00:51:29,788
<font color="yellow">Why do you let others decide how your hair should look?</font>

727
00:51:30,818 --> 00:51:33,648
<font color="yellow">You can't even express your opinions clearly.</font>

728
00:51:33,948 --> 00:51:35,988
<font color="yellow">Why are you so shy?</font>

729
00:51:37,688 --> 00:51:39,088
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

730
00:51:39,518 --> 00:51:42,448
<font color="yellow">If you can't say anything, I'll speak for you.</font>

731
00:51:43,748 --> 00:51:45,048
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Curly. - Curly.</font>

732
00:51:49,248 --> 00:51:51,388
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going, Curly? - Where are you going?</font>

733
00:51:51,388 --> 00:51:53,588
<font color="yellow">- Are you an old lady? - It looks ridiculous.</font>

734
00:51:56,048 --> 00:51:57,188
<font color="yellow">Silent...</font>

735
00:51:57,918 --> 00:52:01,318
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, the judges' time is precious.</font>

736
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:03,548
<font color="yellow">- Please get started. - I'm...</font>

737
00:52:03,548 --> 00:52:05,088
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

738
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:08,148
<font color="yellow">Everyone fears being stared at to some extent.</font>

739
00:52:16,018 --> 00:52:17,748
<font color="yellow">My father wanted me to become a leader.</font>

740
00:52:18,748 --> 00:52:22,288
<font color="yellow">A global leader.</font>

741
00:52:22,818 --> 00:52:25,618
<font color="yellow">He did not allow me to have even a tiny bit of fear.</font>

742

<font color="yellow">He even went as far as...</font>

743
00:52:30,918 --> 00:52:32,588
<font color="yellow">bribing my teacher...</font>

744
00:52:33,548 --> 00:52:35,218
<font color="yellow">so that I could...</font>

745
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:38,848
<font color="yellow">be at the center of attention.</font>

746
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:50,288
<font color="yellow">What if I miss the beat?</font>

747
00:52:50,348 --> 00:52:52,248
<font color="yellow">What if I forget the lyrics?</font>

748
00:52:52,718 --> 00:52:55,688
<font color="yellow">It'll be fine. I practiced a lot.</font>

749
00:52:56,448 --> 00:52:59,948
<font color="yellow">What if my voice has become hoarse from all the practice?</font>

750
00:53:00,448 --> 00:53:02,718
<font color="yellow">I don't deserve to sing a solo part in the first place.</font>

751
00:53:02,748 --> 00:53:05,118
<font color="yellow">It's not like I got the solo part because I'm a good singer.</font>

752
00:53:05,748 --> 00:53:07,688
<font color="yellow">On the day they chose who'll sing the solo part,</font>

753
00:53:08,088 --> 00:53:10,548
<font color="yellow">Yeong Sik, the best singer in class,</font>

754
00:53:10,718 --> 00:53:12,418
<font color="yellow">buried his head to his desk and cried.</font>

755
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:15,018
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for him.</font>

756
00:53:15,788 --> 00:53:17,118
<font color="yellow">Start singing.</font>

757
00:53:17,318 --> 00:53:19,688
<font color="yellow">Glad tidings I bring.</font>

758
00:53:19,788 --> 00:53:22,288

01:08:05,388 --> 01:08:08,348
<font color="yellow">If you just stand there and watch,</font>

928
01:08:10,148 --> 01:08:12,348
<font color="yellow">nothing will happen.</font>

929
01:08:19,918 --> 01:08:21,788
<font color="yellow">Just by watching,</font>

930
01:08:24,918 --> 01:08:26,988
<font color="yellow">you can't protect anyone.</font>

931
01:09:31,348 --> 01:09:34,218
<font color="yellow">(My Shy Boss)</font>

932
01:09:34,688 --> 01:09:36,448
<font color="yellow">It felt warm.</font>

933
01:09:36,448 --> 01:09:38,688
<font color="yellow">I said I'm sorry.</font>

934
01:09:38,688 --> 01:09:40,888
<font color="yellow">- I'm the one who should say that. - He held you in his arms?</font>

935
01:09:40,888 --> 01:09:42,588
<font color="yellow">I just vaguely remember the smell.</font>

936
01:09:42,588 --> 01:09:43,888
<font color="yellow">It smelled like peppermint candy.</font>

937
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:47,258
<font color="yellow">What Silent Monster needs right now is not work, but teamwork.</font>

938
01:09:47,258 --> 01:09:48,948
<font color="yellow">Why don't we have a workshop to build up teamwork?</font>

939
01:09:48,948 --> 01:09:50,788
<font color="yellow">Will it be an overnight trip?</font>

940
01:09:50,788 --> 01:09:52,488
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't he tell people that he's engaged?</font>

941
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,758
<font color="yellow">Are you stopping him from doing that, too?</font>

942
01:09:53,848 --> 01:09:56,088
<font color="yellow">I can never lie to you.</font>

943
01:09:56,088 --> 01:09:57,758
<font color="yellow">A video clip?</font>

944
01:09:57,758 --> 01:09:59,258
<font color="yellow">I really don't understand what you're talking about.</font>

945
01:09:59,888 --> 01:10:01,418
<font color="yellow">- What are you watching? - He's not saying anything.</font>

946
01:10:01,418 --> 01:10:02,788
<font color="yellow">Is that Mr. Eun?</font>

947
01:10:02,788 --> 01:10:05,948
<font color="yellow">I'll try to make Mr. Eun become like Mr. Kang.</font>

948
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:08,648
<font color="yellow">That's absurd. It'll be impossible.</font>

949
01:10:08,648 --> 01:10:10,348
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Hwan Gi will change.</font>

950
01:10:10,448 --> 01:10:11,588
<font color="yellow">He's capable of doing that.</font>

951
01:10:11,918 --> 01:10:15,318
<font color="yellow">I hope this workshop will help Hwan Gi change.</font>
