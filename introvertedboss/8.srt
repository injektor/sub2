<font color="yellow">I guess Panda isn't here yet.</font>

2
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,740
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

3
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,340
<font color="yellow">I missed someone.</font>

4
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,880
<font color="yellow">I jumped on the plane on impulse.</font>

5
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,610
<font color="yellow">And you came all the way here?</font>

6
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,840
<font color="yellow">This far?</font>

7
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,880
<font color="yellow">This was the only way I could see her.</font>

8
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,440
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see her.</font>

9
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,810
<font color="yellow">Where's the director?</font>

10
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,710
<font color="yellow">The director?</font>

11
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,040
<font color="yellow">Did you think I was talking about...</font>

12
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,510
<font color="yellow">No, no. Not at all.</font>

13
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,680
<font color="yellow">You were part of the reason.</font>

14
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,880
<font color="yellow">I thought I should come because I got worried after you called me.</font>

15
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,610
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have said it.</font>

16
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,550
<font color="yellow">Ro Woon.</font>

17
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,910
<font color="yellow">All right, let's go.</font>

18
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,210
<font color="yellow">I'll take you to her.</font>

19
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,780
<font color="yellow">She'll be so happy to see you.</font>

20
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,940
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

21
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,110
<font color="yellow">Should we go?</font>

22
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,280
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying? Is he a bad person?</font>

23
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,440
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

24
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,340
<font color="yellow">No, he's not a bad person.</font>

25
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,580
<font color="yellow">Then is it because he's not the man in black?</font>

26
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,840
<font color="yellow">You've been waiting for the man in black the whole time,</font>

27
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,710
<font color="yellow">and someone else came. Is that why?</font>

28
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,540
<font color="yellow">That's not it, either.</font>

29
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,680
<font color="yellow">There he is.</font>

30
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,280
<font color="yellow">You're smiling now.</font>

31
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,680
<font color="yellow">I missed you.</font>

32
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,710
<font color="yellow">Did you miss him?</font>

33
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,710
<font color="yellow">Panda!</font>

34
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,210
<font color="yellow">Not just once, but twice?</font>

35
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,580
<font color="yellow">You should have said something.</font>

36
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,680
<font color="yellow">You disappeared without a word and got us flustered.</font>

37
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,110
<font color="yellow">You could have asked us for help.</font>

38
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,480
<font color="yellow">Did you see the pictures?</font>

39
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,040
<font color="yellow">I can totally picture you wandering all over the place...</font>

40
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,210
<font color="yellow">not being able to ask others for help.</font>

41
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,210
<font color="yellow">That must be why it took so long.</font>

42
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,180
<font color="yellow">I'm so frustrated by you.</font>

43
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,580
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I made you wait.</font>

44
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,910
<font color="yellow">Well, I didn't exactly wait for you.</font>

45
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,480
<font color="yellow">She did.</font>

46
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,610
<font color="yellow">She's been waiting for the man in black to come...</font>

47
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,940
<font color="yellow">the whole time.</font>

48
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,440
<font color="yellow">That's just...</font>

49
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,810
<font color="yellow">because of the last picture.</font>

50
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,810
<font color="yellow">So many people are waiting for more pictures.</font>

51
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,280
<font color="yellow">Let's take one.</font>

52
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,680
<font color="yellow">It's a beautifully happy ending.</font>

53
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,210
<font color="yellow">All right. Let me take a picture.</font>

54
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,880
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

55
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,010
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

56
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,340

<font color="yellow">I wasn't planning to come, so I'll have to stay with you.</font>

<font color="yellow">By the way, this is not even a twin room.</font>

<font color="yellow">Are we really going to share the bed?</font>

68
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,480
<font color="yellow">Should we ask for an extra bed?</font>

69
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,580
<font color="yellow">Or should I sleep on the sofa?</font>

70
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,940
<font color="yellow">That felt weird.</font>

71
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,840
<font color="yellow">Could it be because you don't usually react this way?</font>

92
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,210

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

462
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,830
<font color="yellow">I just said you'd probably be very good at rock climbing...</font>

463
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,730
<font color="yellow">and it'd make me like you even more.</font>

464
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,100
<font color="yellow">- What should I talk about?
- What should I talk about?</font>

465
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:00,560
<font color="yellow">- What should I say?
- What should I say?</font>

466
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,900
<font color="yellow">- What should I talk about?
- What should I talk about?</font>

467
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,930
<font color="yellow">- What should I say?
- What should I say?</font>

468
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,300
<font color="yellow">- What should I talk about?
- What should I talk about?</font>

469
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,200
<font color="yellow">Right, that'll do.</font>

470
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,330
<font color="yellow">All guys' common interest.</font>

471
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,980
<font color="yellow">I'm quite good at rowing, aren't I?</font>

472
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,320
<font color="yellow">I served in the navy.</font>

473
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,280
<font color="yellow">Just like Admiral Yi Sun Shin.</font>

474
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,150
<font color="yellow">I think you're rowing in the wrong direction.</font>

475
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,610
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

476
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,780
<font color="yellow">- I see.
- Can I try?</font>

477
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,910
<font color="yellow">Turn back.</font>

478
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,320
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

479
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,610
<font color="yellow">Gosh, let go. Let go of me.</font>

480
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,210
<font color="yellow">- Help!
- It's okay now.</font>

481
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,450
<font color="yellow">You're okay now.</font>

482
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,150
<font color="yellow">You said you served in the navy.</font>

483
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,150
<font color="yellow">I worked at the PX.</font>

484
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,110
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

485
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,680
<font color="yellow">In the army, you have to live in a group.</font>

486
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,150
<font color="yellow">Were you exempted from military service thanks to your father?</font>

487
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,680
<font color="yellow">Counter-terrorism unit.</font>

488
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,580
<font color="yellow">Do you mean you served in the special forces?</font>

489
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:08,050
<font color="yellow">- Did you work at the PX, too?
- I was a sniper.</font>

490
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,250
<font color="yellow">You were a sniper? Really?</font>

491
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,110
<font color="yellow">It's better to be facing the same direction.</font>

492
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,380
<font color="yellow">It sure feels much better.</font>

493
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,750
<font color="yellow">Private Um Sun Bong.</font>

494
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,210
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Start from the right side. One.</font>

495
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,150
<font color="yellow">- One. Right side first.
- Right side?</font>

496
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,320
<font color="yellow">Mr. Um.</font>

497
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,880
<font color="yellow">Right side first.</font>

498
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,280
<font color="yellow">One, two.</font>

499
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,550
<font color="yellow">One, two. That's wrong. Start over.</font>

500
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,910
<font color="yellow">One, two.</font>

501
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,210
<font color="yellow">Right side first. One.</font>

502
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,250
<font color="yellow">I looked everywhere for you.</font>

503
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,050
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's hot.</font>

504
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,350
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I took it out on you.</font>

505
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,350
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, too.</font>

506
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,320
<font color="yellow">I should have noticed how you were feeling sooner.</font>

507
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,350
<font color="yellow">Why did you find it out, of all people?</font>

508
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
<font color="yellow">Please don't tell Se Jong.</font>

509
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,380
<font color="yellow">I don't want him to know.</font>

510
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,710
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to say anything.</font>

511
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,750
<font color="yellow">You tell him.</font>

512
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,180
<font color="yellow">Stop keeping it to yourself.</font>

513
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,350
<font color="yellow">Don't get startled. Just don't look them in the eye.</font>

514
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,180
<font color="yellow">Am I...</font>

515
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,280
<font color="yellow">not allowed to even look monkeys in the eye?</font>

516
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,880
<font color="yellow">- Well...
- When I was a secretary,</font>

517
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,910
<font color="yellow">I had to keep my head down to avoid Boss's eyes.</font>

518
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,380
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

519
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,410
<font color="yellow">When I can't even look monkeys in the eye,</font>

520
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,610
<font color="yellow">how could I look a chairman's grandson in the eye?</font>

521
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,680
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

522
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,410
<font color="yellow">I can't look him in the eye.</font>

523
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,410
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

524
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,180
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

525
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,450
<font color="yellow">isn't that your bag?</font>

526
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,610
<font color="yellow">Wait, where's my bag?</font>

527
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,150
<font color="yellow">The monkey just took it.</font>

528
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,580
<font color="yellow">Let me go with you.</font>

529
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,050
<font color="yellow">Just hold on to this.</font>

530
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,380
<font color="yellow">Ro Woon lost her bag because of me.</font>

531
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,880
<font color="yellow">I'm of no help to anyone.</font>

532
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,110
<font color="yellow">- It was fun.
- I enjoyed it very much.</font>

533
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,750
<font color="yellow">Hwan Gi.</font>

534
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,210
<font color="yellow">- Where have you been?
- I took some rest.</font>

535
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,880
<font color="yellow">By the way, have you seen Ms. Chae?</font>

536
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,950
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim.</font>

537
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:26,110
<font color="yellow">Ms. Chae had that jacket.</font>

538
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,480
<font color="yellow">Is... Is this yours?</font>

539
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,820
<font color="yellow">Why is it in my hands?</font>

540
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,550
<font color="yellow">Where's Ms. Chae now?</font>

541
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,950
<font color="yellow">A monkey took her bag. She went to get it back.</font>

542
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,350
<font color="yellow">- When?
- Where did she go?</font>

543
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,180
<font color="yellow">That way.</font>

544
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,410
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

545
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,450
<font color="yellow">- Why are you following me?
- I'm not.</font>

546
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,710
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to find Ro Woon.
- Why are you looking for her?</font>

547
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,050
<font color="yellow">She was looking for me earlier. She told me it was urgent.</font>

548
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,180
<font color="yellow">It's nothing important.</font>

549
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,880
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking for her?</font>

550
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,280
<font color="yellow">You even look pale.</font>

551
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,080
<font color="yellow">I'm not looking for her. My camera...</font>

552
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,350
<font color="yellow">is in that bag. You can go on your way.</font>

553
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,380
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

554
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,150
<font color="yellow">- I'll help you look.
- I don't need your help.</font>

555
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,750
<font color="yellow">The sun will go down soon. I'm worried.</font>

556
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:39,780
<font color="yellow">There is no need to worry.</font>

557
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,820
<font color="yellow">- She's our staff.
- She's my staff.</font>

558
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,650
<font color="yellow">- I hired her.
- Don't be immature.</font>

559
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,150
<font color="yellow">If she's lost and hurt,</font>

560
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,310
<font color="yellow">you better not act emotional.</font>

561
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,380
<font color="yellow">You're the one acting emotional.</font>

562
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,310
<font color="yellow">Do you want to get physical then?</font>

563
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,910
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- What?</font>

564
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,580
<font color="yellow">You just stepped on my foot.</font>

565
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,480
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

566
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,480
<font color="yellow">- I stepped on it on purpose.
- Are you serious?</font>

567
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,180
<font color="yellow">How long has it been...</font>

568
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,680
<font color="yellow">since we got so friendly?</font>

569
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,310
<font color="yellow">I saw you rush over after getting Ro Woon's call.</font>

570
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,610
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you answer my call?</font>

571
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,010
<font color="yellow">You sound like you're jealous of her.</font>

572
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,680
<font color="yellow">Tell me, why didn't you pick up?</font>

573
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,110
<font color="yellow">Because it's obvious you'd tell me to leave!</font>

574
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,980
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- What?</font>

575
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,610
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

576
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:33,480
<font color="yellow">Hey, why did you come here?</font>

577
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,110
<font color="yellow">I came to think.</font>

578
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,350
<font color="yellow">I needed time alone to think.</font>

579
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,580
<font color="yellow">You should have still told her. Why didn't you tell Yi Soo?</font>

580
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,110
<font color="yellow">I'm sure your father knows.</font>

581
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,980
<font color="yellow">No matter where I go, I'm still under his thumb.</font>

582
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,110
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you answer Yi Soo's call?</font>

583
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,150
<font color="yellow">If you talked to her, you must know what happened.</font>

584
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,850
<font color="yellow">Then why is it that you're not worried about me?</font>

585
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,280
<font color="yellow">When I saw that you left a boarding pass on my desk,</font>

586
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,680
<font color="yellow">I thought you understood me.</font>

587
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,310
<font color="yellow">I was thankful that you wanted to console me.</font>

588
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,580
<font color="yellow">Once I got here, you were acting so cold to me.</font>

589
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,050
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Just go back right now.</font>

590
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,280
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep on telling me to leave?</font>

591
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,710
<font color="yellow">Do you know how Yi Soo...</font>

592
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,980
<font color="yellow">- What about Yi Soo?
- She...</font>

593
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,410
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

594
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,550
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

595
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,550
<font color="yellow">Yi Soo is your family, but I'm not.</font>

596
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:51,780
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant.</font>

597
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,410
<font color="yellow">You're telling me you'd be done with me if I hurt Yi Soo.</font>

598
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,480
<font color="yellow">Your father will abandon me.</font>

599
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,810
<font color="yellow">I'd be kicked out from the company, and you'd never see me again!</font>

600
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:02,680
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to threaten me, too?</font>

601
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,810
<font color="yellow">You're just like your father.</font>

602
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,180
<font color="yellow">Stop blaming others and be honest with yourself.</font>

603
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,910
<font color="yellow">You're the one abandoning others blinded by something else.</font>

604
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,910
<font color="yellow">- You're not being abandoned.
- Why you...</font>

605
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,210
<font color="yellow">Anyone there?</font>

606
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,010
<font color="yellow">Help me!</font>

607
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,110
<font color="yellow">- It's this way.
- This way.</font>

608
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:32,480
<font color="yellow">Her voice definitely came from this direction.</font>

609
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:35,010
<font color="yellow">All right. You can go that way. It's safer there.</font>

610
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:36,480
<font color="yellow">- I'll go this way.
- Wait.</font>

611
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,380
<font color="yellow">You should go this way.</font>

612
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,610
<font color="yellow">How did it get up there?</font>

613
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:09,810
<font color="yellow">Boss?</font>

614
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,180
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

615
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,050
<font color="yellow">I'm fine, but what happened to you?</font>

616
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:17,310
<font color="yellow">If you're fine, why did you scream?</font>

617
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,810
<font color="yellow">I couldn't reach it.</font>

618
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,710
<font color="yellow">My cell phone is in the bag, so I couldn't call anyone.</font>

619
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:28,610
<font color="yellow">Going back down and up would be too tiring.</font>

620
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,410
<font color="yellow">- I thought it was an emergency.
- It is an emergency.</font>

621
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,020
<font color="yellow">Your camera is in there.</font>

622
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,450
<font color="yellow">Were you worried about me?</font>

623
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,550
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

624
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,580
<font color="yellow">You're bleeding.</font>

625
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,680
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. It's okay.</font>

626
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,150
<font color="yellow">Did you come for me?</font>

627
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,920
<font color="yellow">Camera... Did you look at the camera?</font>

628
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,450
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

629
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,550
<font color="yellow">Did you look at the pictures inside it or not?</font>

630
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,980
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

631
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,380
<font color="yellow">Is there something weird in there?</font>

632
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,780
<font color="yellow">Is that why you ran here?</font>

633
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,150
<font color="yellow">All right. Here.</font>

634
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:45,220
<font color="yellow">Go on top of me.</font>

635
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,950
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

636
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,020
<font color="yellow">We need to get it back.</font>

637
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,720
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me to step on you?</font>

638
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,050
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

639
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,350
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

640
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,550
<font color="yellow">are you going to kneel?</font>

641
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,950
<font color="yellow">Can I really go on you?</font>

642
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,450
<font color="yellow">It's my first time seeing you like this.</font>

643
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,550
<font color="yellow">It's not the first time.</font>

644
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,580
<font color="yellow">Pardon? What did you say?</font>

645
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,980
<font color="yellow">It's not the first time?</font>

646
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,720
<font color="yellow">Hurry up, you're heavy.</font>

647
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,520
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

648
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,020
<font color="yellow">A bit higher.</font>

649
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,550
<font color="yellow">- Higher?
- Yes.</font>

650
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,620
<font color="yellow">Can you get it?</font>

651
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:53,950
<font color="yellow">Not even close.</font>

652
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,880
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- Put me down.</font>

653
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,250
<font color="yellow">- Is it not working?
- No.</font>

654
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,080
<font color="yellow">Put me down.</font>

655
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,450
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

656
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,520
<font color="yellow">What... What are you doing?</font>

657
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,150
<font color="yellow">Come on. Stand up.</font>

658
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,980
<font color="yellow">- You want me to stand up?
- Yes, hurry.</font>

659
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,660
<font color="yellow">Okay. One, two, three.</font>

660
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,800
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Hold on tight.</font>

661
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,100
<font color="yellow">Even if you don't like me,</font>

662
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,200
<font color="yellow">- please hold onto me or I'll fall.
- Okay.</font>

663
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,900
<font color="yellow">- Hold me tight.
- Okay, tightly.</font>

664
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,760
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

665
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,900
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- No. Take a step forward.</font>

666
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,030
<font color="yellow">- Forward?
- Yes.</font>

667
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:41,060
<font color="yellow">- Forward, like this?
- No, no.</font>

668
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,360
<font color="yellow">A little bit to the left. Left.</font>

669
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,830
<font color="yellow">- Left?
- This way. Yes</font>

670
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,960
<font color="yellow">- No, no. To the right.
- Right?</font>

671
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,400
<font color="yellow">No. That's not right.</font>

672
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,730
<font color="yellow">- Sorry.
- Hold on.</font>

673
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:54,800
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

674
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,800
<font color="yellow">- I'm almost there.
- Did you get it?</font>

675
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,130
<font color="yellow">I got it. I got it.</font>

676
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,300
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

677
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,300
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

678
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,700
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

679
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,700
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Did you sprain your ankle?</font>

680
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,130
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt a lot?</font>

681
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,970
<font color="yellow">- What should we do? Are you okay?
- Yes.</font>

682
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,200
<font color="yellow">Ms. Chae.</font>

683
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:39,030
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

684
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:42,770
<font color="yellow">What's going on? What happened?</font>

685
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,180
<font color="yellow">Nothing much.</font>

686
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,180
<font color="yellow">- Nothing happened.
- Why are you on the ground?</font>

687
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,340
<font color="yellow">- Did you hurt yourself?
- I'm just relaxing.</font>

688
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,880
<font color="yellow">I'm really okay, I promise.</font>

689
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,210
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

690
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,110
<font color="yellow">- Hwan Gi.
- Boss.</font>

691
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,810
<font color="yellow">What should we do? Do you think you can walk?</font>

692
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,810
<font color="yellow">- Boss.
- I'm okay.</font>

693
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,850
<font color="yellow">You two look great together.</font>

694
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,710
<font color="yellow">Put me down now.</font>

695
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,340
<font color="yellow">You're making it harder for me. Stay still.</font>

696
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,680
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't do it.</font>

697
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:35,980
<font color="yellow">You better behave yourself.</font>

698
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:37,840
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

699
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:41,980
<font color="yellow">Did you see my camera?</font>

700
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:47,210
<font color="yellow">Did you see the pictures in it or not?</font>

701
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:58,340
<font color="yellow">What's in it?</font>

702
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,180
<font color="yellow">You put on weight because you're always stuck in your room.</font>

703
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,910
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

704
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,650
<font color="yellow">- Cheers.
- Great job, everyone.</font>

705
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,550
<font color="yellow">- Cheers.
- Cheers.</font>

706
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:34,080
<font color="yellow">- The wine tastes great.
- Enjoy your food.</font>

707
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,050
<font color="yellow">Sun Bong, go easy on the alcohol.</font>

708
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,210
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

709
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:52,550
<font color="yellow">- What was that?
- You look pretty.</font>

710
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,110
<font color="yellow">I'm going to upload it on my SNS account.</font>

711
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:57,550
<font color="yellow">Oh, you look so cute in this one.</font>

712
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:58,880
<font color="yellow">Don't you think, Gyo Ri?</font>

713
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,250
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ro Woon is cute.</font>

714
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,250
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

715
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:09,180
<font color="yellow">Who told you you could upload a picture of me?</font>

716
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,580
<font color="yellow">Why did you delete it?</font>

717
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,850
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

718
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,580
<font color="yellow">Let's take one together.</font>

719
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,710
<font color="yellow">- Hey, look at the camera.
- Forget it.</font>

720
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:20,680
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- One, two, three.</font>

721
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,580
<font color="yellow">Great.</font>

722
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,010
<font color="yellow">This is fantastic. Look at this.</font>

723
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:38,210
<font color="yellow">- She's so cute.
- Look at this.</font>

724
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:41,580
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

725
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,810
<font color="yellow">You're unbelievable, Ro Woon.</font>

726
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,750
<font color="yellow">This is why I love you.</font>

727
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,080
<font color="yellow">Cut it out. You can't upload that one, can you?</font>

728
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,180
<font color="yellow">If you upload that, you're dead meat.</font>

729
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,010
<font color="yellow">I'm still going to upload it.</font>

730
00:54:57,850 --> 00:54:59,010
<font color="yellow">I love you, Ro Woon.</font>

731
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:01,980
<font color="yellow">I love you so much.</font>

732
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,280
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

733
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:09,010
<font color="yellow">Boss, look at this.</font>

734
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,150
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

735
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,980
<font color="yellow">Maybe...</font>

736
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,280
<font color="yellow">I'll get to see him laugh.</font>

737
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,450
<font color="yellow">Laugh.</font>

738
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:22,110
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it funny?
- It's funny, right?</font>

739
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,450
<font color="yellow">- He's about to laugh.
- He's going to laugh.</font>

740
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,580
<font color="yellow">Is he finally going to laugh?</font>

741
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,710
<font color="yellow">He's going to laugh soon. It's funny, isn't it?</font>

742
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,480
<font color="yellow">Look how funny it is.</font>

743
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:32,810
<font color="yellow">Not a chance.</font>

744
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:37,750
<font color="yellow">- Isn't she cute?
- Is that Ms. Chae?</font>

745
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,180
<font color="yellow">- Can you look like that?
- Stop it.</font>

746
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,210
<font color="yellow">Put the phone away. Stop it.</font>

747
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:46,010
<font color="yellow">Look at that face. Look at those eyes.</font>

748
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:49,910
<font color="yellow">Stop it. Do you have to do this here?</font>

749
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:52,950
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to interrupt,</font>

750
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,110
<font color="yellow">but can I have your attention for a minute?</font>

751
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,210
<font color="yellow">The director...</font>

752
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,150
<font color="yellow">would like to thank you.</font>

753
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:13,310
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for giving the kids...</font>

754
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,450
<font color="yellow">unforgettable memories.</font>

755
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:18,980
<font color="yellow">- We should thank you.
- Thank you.</font>

756
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,980
<font color="yellow">- We'll never forget this.
- It was so fun.</font>

757
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,710
<font color="yellow">By the way, you seem to...</font>

758
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:29,850
<font color="yellow">like Mr. Kang very much.</font>

759
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,850
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

760
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:36,110
<font color="yellow">You can't stop smiling at Mr. Kang.</font>

761
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,110
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

762
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:41,310
<font color="yellow">Please excuse me now.</font>

763
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,580
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

764
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,750
<font color="yellow">I'd like to thank you, too.</font>

765
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:04,480
<font color="yellow">This project was very meaningful to me personally.</font>

766
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,580
<font color="yellow">White Cloud Orphanage is...</font>

767
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:13,410
<font color="yellow">my childhood home.</font>

768
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,780
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- Didn't you grow up abroad?</font>

769
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,850
<font color="yellow">I thought so, too.</font>

770
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:28,750
<font color="yellow">Thank you for finding my family I lost a long time ago.</font>

771
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,380
<font color="yellow">It's all thanks to Silent Monster.</font>

772
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,410
<font color="yellow">Us?</font>

773
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,780
<font color="yellow">- We did a good job.
- I guess.</font>

774
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,980
<font color="yellow">We're always grateful.</font>

775
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,950
<font color="yellow">You served in the counter-terrorism unit?</font>

776
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:15,510
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

777
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:21,880
<font color="yellow">A sniper who shoots people from somewhere hidden?</font>

778
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:26,780
<font color="yellow">Then again, that'd suit you quite well.</font>

779
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,050
<font color="yellow">But it's still hard to believe you were in special forces.</font>

780
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:31,110
<font color="yellow">It's a lie, isn't it?</font>

781
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,450
<font color="yellow">It was my father's order.</font>

782
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,150
<font color="yellow">He wanted me to become a man.</font>

783
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,350
<font color="yellow">I thought...</font>

784
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:54,980
<font color="yellow">I had found out everything about you.</font>

785
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,310
<font color="yellow">But I was wrong.</font>

786
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,980
<font color="yellow">There was still more to learn.</font>

787
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,750
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

788
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,980
<font color="yellow">I saw the pictures in your camera.</font>

789
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,580
<font color="yellow">It's a misunderstanding.</font>

790
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,180
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

791
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:17,850
<font color="yellow">happened to take those pictures without any intention.</font>

792
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,580
<font color="yellow">They were quite a few.</font>

793
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,210
<font color="yellow">I didn't even know you were taking those pictures.</font>

794
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:24,980
<font color="yellow">You sure are a sniper.</font>

795
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,410
<font color="yellow">I didn't have any weird intention, I swear.</font>

796
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:29,550
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

797
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,350
<font color="yellow">You like me, don't you?</font>

798
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:40,480
<font color="yellow">I could see how much you care about me from those pictures.</font>

799
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,810
<font color="yellow">Don't be so shy.</font>

800
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,450
<font color="yellow">What's so shameful about a boss caring about his staff?</font>

801
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,650
<font color="yellow">The camera was full of pictures of the staff.</font>

802
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:08,550
<font color="yellow">In addition, you captured the most splendid moments of each.</font>

803
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,280
<font color="yellow">Now that I think of it,</font>

804
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,980
<font color="yellow">I was no different from your father.</font>

805
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,180
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you were watching everyone from behind.</font>

806
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:30,480
<font color="yellow">That's who you are.</font>

807
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:36,150
<font color="yellow">And you're good enough the way you are.</font>

808
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:42,880
<font color="yellow">I kept telling you to change.</font>

809
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,150
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I pushed you like that.</font>

810
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:03,950
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

811
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:08,450
<font color="yellow">Here. Put this on.</font>

812
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,680
<font color="yellow">Gyo Ri washed it for you.</font>

813
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,250
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

814
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,310
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

815
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,050
<font color="yellow">I won't try to change you anymore.</font>

816
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:29,110
<font color="yellow">There must be a way of communication that's right for you.</font>

817
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:31,110
<font color="yellow">Let's find it.</font>

818
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,650
<font color="yellow">You thought of posting about Panda's journey for Rose Airlines...</font>

819
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:37,850
<font color="yellow">and moved people's hearts in your own way.</font>

820
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:46,710
<font color="yellow">Don't change.</font>

<font color="yellow">That completes the real Eun Hwan Gi.</font>

823
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,810
<font color="yellow">Oh, you smiled.</font>

824
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:27,310
<font color="yellow">You just smiled, right?</font>

825
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:35,510
<font color="yellow">I saw you smile just now.</font>

826
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,580
<font color="yellow">I know you smiled.</font>

827
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,510
<font color="yellow">- You did.
- No, I didn't smile.</font>

828
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:40,710
<font color="yellow">You did smile.</font>

829
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:43,180
<font color="yellow">- No, I didn't.
- Show me just once more.</font>

830
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,180
<font color="yellow">- I didn't smile.
- You did. Just once more, please.</font>

831
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:47,410
<font color="yellow">I really didn't.</font>

832
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:49,880
<font color="yellow">Come on. I know you smiled.</font>

833
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,680
<font color="yellow">Just one more time, please. Show me your smile once more. Boss.</font>

834
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,180
<font color="yellow">Boss, show me one more time. Just once more, please?</font>

835
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:01,950
<font color="yellow">Just one more time. Are you being shy?</font>

836
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:05,280
<font color="yellow">Show me just once more. Please? Boss.</font>

837
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,510
<font color="yellow">Ms. Chae.</font>

838
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,210
<font color="yellow">I've been looking for you.</font>

839
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,280
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

840
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,980
<font color="yellow">Can you spare me a second?</font>

841
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:18,510
<font color="yellow">Let's talk first. We have stuff to talk about.</font>

842
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:20,580
<font color="yellow">I guess we do.</font>

843
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:24,980
<font color="yellow">Shall I give you guys some privacy?</font>

844
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,510
<font color="yellow">- Would you mind?
- Just stay.</font>

845
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,750
<font color="yellow">It has nothing to do with her. Just let her go.</font>

846
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:36,480
<font color="yellow">What I want to talk to you about should concern her.</font>

847
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,580
<font color="yellow">- I'll go first.
- Listen to me first.</font>

848
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:42,980
<font color="yellow">There's something you don't know.</font>

849
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,480
<font color="yellow">And you think you always know everything?</font>

850
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:52,080
<font color="yellow">That's strange.</font>

851
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:55,180
<font color="yellow">Things were good earlier.</font>

852
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:01,950
<font color="yellow">How about we grab a drink together?</font>

853
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,210
<font color="yellow">I thought I lost it.</font>

854
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,410
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you had it.</font>

855
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,650
<font color="yellow">Did you see it?</font>

856
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:39,850
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

857
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:41,350
<font color="yellow">You're thanking me now, right?</font>

858
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:43,910
<font color="yellow">- Why are you giving it to me now?
- I wasn't going to give it to you,</font>

859
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,050
<font color="yellow">but I changed my mind.</font>

860
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:13,550
<font color="yellow">- Shall we begin?
- Bring it on.</font>

861
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:31,680
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang! Please be careful.</font>

862
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:38,250
<font color="yellow">- My shoe... Where did it go?
- Your shoe?</font>

863
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:42,150
<font color="yellow">It's right here. Shall I carry it for you?</font>

864
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:44,450
<font color="yellow">Is it this way or that way?</font>

865
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:47,480
<font color="yellow">This way. It's this way. Let's go.</font>

866
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:48,850
<font color="yellow">Oh, no...</font>

867
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:00,110
<font color="yellow">Are you crying?</font>

868
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,310
<font color="yellow">She's so ugly.</font>

869
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:16,110
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

870
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:22,380
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my goodness.
- I do look so ugly.</font>

871
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,450
<font color="yellow">That totally sobered me up.</font>

872
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,750
<font color="yellow">We're here.</font>

873
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,580
