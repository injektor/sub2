2
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
<font color=#FFFF00>All right, then.
How about you two start talking now?</font>

3
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,250
<font color=#FFFF00>All you two have been doing is
glaring at each other.</font>

4
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:54,140
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Are you going to say that
I'm petty again if I don't talk?</font>

5
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Hmph.</font>

6
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Did that hurt your feelings?</font>

7
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,830
<font color=#FFFF00>And you've been mad about that
this whole time, too? How petty.</font>

8
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,200
<font color=#FFFF00>The thing about being a man
of few words, you see...</font>

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a courtesy I extend to others.</font>

10
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,640
<font color=#FFFF00>A courtesy. All right?
It's a courtesy.</font>

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you familiar with that concept? Huh?</font>

12
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,830
<font color=#FFFF00>That a person must have
a reason for what he does.</font>

13
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,100
<font color=#FFFF00>And I'm sure he'll stop
acting like that after a while.</font>

14
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,650
<font color=#FFFF00>I held back, and held back,
and endured, and waited</font>

15
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,850
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm mustering up all
of my will to speak right now.</font>

16
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how hard
this is for me? Huh?</font>

17
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,150
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd appreciate it if you
recognized that fact.</font>

18
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you think I just go around saying
whatever I please, because I'm me?</font>

19
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you?</font>

20
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,320
<font color=#FFFF00>- No.
- No?</font>

21
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,310
<font color=#FFFF00>- No!
- Psh.</font>

22
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh really, now?</font>

23
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:55,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen, the reason I talk a lot is
because I have a lot I need to say!</font>

24
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,940
<font color=#FFFF00>But I can't even say a fraction of
the things I really want to say!</font>

25
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,250
<font color=#FFFF00>I hold back too, you know!</font>

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,790
<font color=#FFFF00>I have my own worries...</font>

27
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,350
<font color=#FFFF00>and I hold back a lot too!
Do you know that?</font>

28
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,650
<font color=#FFFF00>No, you don't know.</font>

29
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,040
<font color=#FFFF00>So you hold back?
And you have worries?</font>

30
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,850
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand how both of you must feel.</font>

31
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,150
<font color=#FFFF00>So how about you two say
what you really want to say now...</font>

32
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,540
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh, I'll go first.
- Hey.</font>

33
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait your turn. Who said
that you could go first, huh?</font>

34
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did my liquor go?
It's gone. Where did it go?</font>

35
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,650
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

36
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,850
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no liquor now.</font>

37
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,850
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'll get some.
- I'm fine...</font>

38
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,250
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get some.</font>

39
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,350
<font color=#FFFF00>And don't you dare run away.</font>

40
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh no...</font>

41
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Loser! I win! I win!</font>

42
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,650
<font color=#FFFF00>We're here! We're here.</font>

43
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,650
<font color=#FFFF00>You're almost there.
All you need to do is walk there.</font>

44
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,940
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay?
- Ugh.</font>

45
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Go? Go where?</font>

46
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,850
<font color=#FFFF00>- Um...
- Go where?</font>

47
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,180
<font color=#FFFF00>We're here!</font>

48
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Take this off for me.</font>

49
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,830
<font color=#FFFF00>You want me to take it off?
Is it bothering you?</font>

50
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,440
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, it is.
- All right.</font>

51
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,540
<font color=#FFFF00>There you go. All done!</font>

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,850
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you.
- Sure.</font>

53
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,750
<font color=#FFFF00>But there's one more.</font>

54
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you crying?</font>

55
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,650
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, you look so ugly!</font>

56
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow! Wow!</font>

57
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,460
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh my gosh. What to do?
- Gosh, this is scary-looking.</font>

58
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,350
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't breathe! Wow.</font>

59
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,950
<font color=#FFFF00>I won. I won!</font>

60
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,950
<font color=#FFFF00>I may have gotten a bit hurt,
but that doesn't matter!</font>

61
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,240
<font color=#FFFF00>I won.</font>

62
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you still in pain?</font>

63
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,850
<font color=#FFFF00>That... that photo...</font>

64
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, laugh to your heart's content!
You didn't laugh when I told you to!</font>

65
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, man.</font>

66
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
<font color=#FFFF00>We're here!</font>

67
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,850
<font color=#FFFF00>All right, just a bit more.</font>

68
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,650
<font color=#FFFF00>You really are ugly.</font>

69
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,950
<font color=#FFFF00>I never you were capable
of smiling this much.</font>

70
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,000
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks nice.</font>

Chae Ro Woon!</font>

76

<font color=#FFFF00>Ugh, move your leg!</font>

77

<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my bad.</font>

78
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Move your head.
Stop using my arm as a pillow.</font>

79
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,850
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.</font>

80
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to move your leg,
already. It's heavy!</font>

81
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,040
<font color=#FFFF00>I did!</font>

is a peculiar woman.</font>

89
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,800
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like I can go back to the way
things were if I stay by her side.</font>

90
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,990
<font color=#FFFF00>And thanks to her, I fought
with you for the first time in a while</font>

91
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,890
<font color=#FFFF00>and had petty spats with you,
and laughed with you.</font>

92
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,590
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like for us to continue doing that.</font>

94
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,090
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't... marry Yi Soo.</font>

95
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,490
<font color=#FFFF00>The reason I'm saying this to you now...</font>

96
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,790
<font color=#FFFF00>is that I don't want to lose you too,
even if it comes to that.</font>

97
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I want you to be understanding,
even if I may be acting selfishly.</font>

98
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:13,090
<font color=#FFFF00>We've never once properly discussed
what happened three years ago.</font>

99

<font color=#FFFF00>How could someone like me...</font>

100
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,990
<font color=#FFFF00>How could someone like me ever...</font>

101
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,090
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I be with you, CEO Kang?</font>

102
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,240
<font color=#FFFF00>It was a ridiculous mistake.</font>

103
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,590
<font color=#FFFF00>I may have done something
I shouldn't have.</font>

104
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't say that.</font>

105
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,090
<font color=#FFFF00>If I stay by her side just because
of the guilt I feel toward that person...</font>

106
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,390
<font color=#FFFF00>it's not fair to Yi Soo to stay
with her when I feel like this.</font>

107
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,090
<font color=#FFFF00>I only realized after sending
that person off like that</font>

108
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:25,590
<font color=#FFFF00>that the true mistake I'd made
was not choosing her.</font>

109
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to make
the same mistake again.</font>

110
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,990
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't make the same mistake
I made last time, either.</font>

111
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't hesitate anymore.</font>

112
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,490
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean by that?</font>

113
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:48,790
<font color=#FFFF00>The person you're trying to "choose"
is Secretary Chae's younger sister.</font>

114
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,350
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

115
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Chae Ro Woon is Chae Ji Hye's
younger sister. Do you understand?</font>

116
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,190
<font color=#FFFF00>What? What kind of...</font>

117
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,590
<font color=#FFFF00>You're sure about this?</font>

118
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you say anything, then?</font>

119
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to kick her out, didn't I?</font>

120
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, you knew from the very beginning?</font>

121
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,590
<font color=#FFFF00>If you knew all this time,
why didn't you...</font>

122
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait a second.</font>

123
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,090

to work at our company, then?</font>

124
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Just... leave her alone.</font>

125
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,090
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

126
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do anything to her.</font>

127
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,690
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you...</font>

128
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,570
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the one...</font>

129
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,390
<font color=#FFFF00>who can't let her go anymore.</font>

130
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you coming out of Boss's room?</font>

131
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Um, I'm not.
I came here to look for him.</font>

132
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,560
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's clear that you're just making
your way out of there! I saw you!</font>

133
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,090
<font color=#FFFF00>No... I told you, it's not like that!</font>

134
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,690
<font color=#FFFF00>I came here to look for him!</font>

135
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you need to
so early in the morning?</font>

136
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,990
<font color=#FFFF00>I was... going to ask him
to eat breakfast with me.</font>

137
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,390
<font color=#FFFF00>So you ran over here
as soon as you woke up</font>

138
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,890
<font color=#FFFF00>just to ask him that?</font>

139
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Without even washing your face first?</font>

140
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,390
<font color=#FFFF00>And without even
combing your hair?</font>

141
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it!</font>

142
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Gyo Ri, you shared a room
with Chae Ro Woon, right?</font>

143
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, hey!</font>

144
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,790
<font color=#FFFF00>I was just curious about whether
or not you got a good night's sleep.</font>

145
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Gyo Ri. Gyo Ri!</font>

146
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you now?</font>

147
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,090
<font color=#FFFF00>All right, I'll be right there.</font>

148
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait, hey! Wait up!</font>

149
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, wait!</font>

150
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait!</font>

151
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,990
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't understand a thing
you're saying to me right now.</font>

152
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,230
<font color=#FFFF00>She came to the company to get revenge.</font>

153
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,720
<font color=#FFFF00>She's the one who leaked the
information to the media back then.</font>

154
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that really true?</font>

155
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,390
<font color=#FFFF00>So why in the world did you
keep that information to yourself...</font>

156
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Because I was afraid
she'd get hurt if I didn't.</font>

157
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,100
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I didn't tell you.</font>

158
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,090
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey, if Father finds out...
- So let's keep it a secret from him.</font>

159
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't let Chae Ro Woon find out
that you know about this.</font>

160
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,290
<font color=#FFFF00>She doesn't know that I know.</font>

161
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, wait! I'll explain, okay?</font>

162
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, Se Jong! Please? Ow!</font>

163
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Ow! Ow! Ow!
That hurts!</font>

164
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Se Jong!</font>

165
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,250
<font color=#FFFF00>You know, the fact that you're trying
to stop me make you more suspicious.</font>

166
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,290
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm telling you, it's nothing fishy,
so what are you even talking about?</font>

167
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, yeah?</font>

168
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait, wait. Wait, wait.</font>

169
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it! Damn it, you're fast!</font>

170
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! Stop right there!</font>

171
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:51,190
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to protect her this time around.</font>

172
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,290
<font color=#FFFF00>If you harbor any guilt regarding
what happened to Secretary Chae...</font>

173
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,870
<font color=#FFFF00>make sure to protect her.</font>

174
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Very good. Cat pose.</font>

175
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Come down.</font>

176
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Breathe.</font>

177
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Breathe out.</font>

178
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,290
<font color=#FFFF00>And come back up.</font>

179
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,980
<font color=#FFFF00>And up. Namaste.</font>

180
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,290
<font color=#FFFF00>- Namaste.
- Namaste.</font>

181
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Gyo Ri! Gyo Ri!</font>

182
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Chae Ro Woon didn't go back
to her room last night, right?</font>

183
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,790
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know. I was tired yesterday,
so I went to bed early...</font>

184
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,180
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no way you weren't aware
if you really were with her.</font>

185
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Chae Ro Woon snores so loudly
when she sleeps!</font>

186
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh... Gyo Ri...</font>

187
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Man, you...</font>

188
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,590
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me the truth.
Who did you sleep with last night?</font>

189
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Boss? CEO Kang?</font>

190
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Or both of them?</font>

191
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, you sure are skilled!</font>

192
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine! I did sleep with him!
I slept with Boss! Happy?</font>

193
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,690
<font color=#FFFF00>See? I told you.
You do like the boss.</font>

194
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,890
<font color=#FFFF00>All we did was sleep.</font>

195
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,490
<font color=#FFFF00>I was dropping him off at his room
after he got too drunk</font>

196
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,190
<font color=#FFFF00>but I passed out because I was so tired.</font>

197
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,190
<font color=#FFFF00>And you expect me to believe that?</font>

198
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah! Fine, then! Don't believe me!</font>

199
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,090
<font color=#FFFF00>This is great, then! So stop messing
around and flirting with me, already!</font>

200
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,460
<font color=#FFFF00>You thought that I was
messing around this whole time?</font>

201
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,690
<font color=#FFFF00>You're always messing around and making
people around you feel uncomfortable.</font>

202
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,790
<font color=#FFFF00>You call that being genuine?</font>

203
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,990
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

204
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,940
<font color=#FFFF00>You have no idea how I was
out all night looking for you</font>

205
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,190
<font color=#FFFF00>so that I could take you
on the tour of the garden.</font>

206
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,690
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't get a wink of sleep
because I was waiting for you.</font>

207
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,620
<font color=#FFFF00>So don't you think it's a bit harsh
to belittle my actions like that?</font>

208
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Jang Se Jong.</font>

209
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Boss.</font>

210
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did CEO Kang go?</font>

211
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,290
<font color=#FFFF00>He returned to Seoul.</font>

212
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, was it something urgent?</font>

213
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:57,690
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. I ended up
falling asleep on your bed.</font>

214
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,890
<font color=#FFFF00>And to top it all off, I got caught.</font>

215
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,190
<font color=#FFFF00>By that big-mouthed
Jang Se Jong, of all people.</font>

216
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,690
<font color=#FFFF00>I should've denied it until the end,
but he was coming on too strong, so...</font>

217
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,190
<font color=#FFFF00>And to be honest...</font>

218
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,490
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't be telling you this...</font>

219
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,690
<font color=#FFFF00>but you're not the type to go
around blabbing to everyone.</font>

220
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,390
<font color=#FFFF00>So keep this to yourself, okay?</font>

221
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,790
<font color=#FFFF00>The truth is...</font>

222
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Gyo Ri likes Se Jong.</font>

223
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,990
<font color=#FFFF00>So I wanted to take this chance
to finally get him off my back.</font>

224
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,290
<font color=#FFFF00>And he keeps telling me
that he likes me all the time</font>

225
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,190
<font color=#FFFF00>which makes me feel
sorry toward Gyo Ri.</font>

226
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,990
<font color=#FFFF00>You were smiling so much
last night, and yet...</font>

227
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,590
<font color=#FFFF00>you became a brooding loner
of a teenage boy overnight.</font>

228
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,690
<font color=#FFFF00>I just don't get it.</font>

229
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:06,490
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I thought of the best way
to communicate with you, and...</font>

230
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,290
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

231
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Just stay still!</font>

232
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Ta-da!</font>

233
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,590
<font color=#FFFF00>There we go.</font>

234
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,490
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's a traffic light.
- Pardon?</font>

235
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,690
<font color=#FFFF00>You can show how you feel
by using colors.</font>

236
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:33,590
<font color=#FFFF00>When you really want to be left alone,
use red to say, "Don't approach me."</font>

237
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,290
<font color=#FFFF00>When I can approach you with a
document to be signed, use yellow.</font>

238
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,480
<font color=#FFFF00>And when you feel good
enough to allow me to ask you</font>

239
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,090
<font color=#FFFF00>to sign off on trivial things,
or talk to you about anything</font>

240
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,690
<font color=#FFFF00>use green.</font>

241
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,190
<font color=#FFFF00>It's fine.
There's no need for this.</font>

242
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,690
<font color=#FFFF00>It may be awkward in the beginning</font>

243
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,890
<font color=#FFFF00>but it'll be more convenient
for you as you get used to it.</font>

244
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

245
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Right now, you have a
red light on, right?</font>

246
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,490
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll shut my mouth now.</font>

247
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Enjoy yourself.</font>

248
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is she belittling me like this?</font>

249
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,690
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you?
Just what am I lacking, exactly?</font>

250
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is she belittling me like this?</font>

251
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Man, these are the
limited-edition sneakers</font>

252
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,290
<font color=#FFFF00>I got yesterday
so I could impress Chae Ro Woon.</font>

253
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,390
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe it's just that I'm too fashionable?</font>

254
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, that must be it!</font>

255
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,190
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because of my
brilliant, shining looks</font>

256
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,890
<font color=#FFFF00>that she thinks I'm shallow
and is belittling me like this.</font>

257
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Damn you, shoes!</font>

258
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,990
<font color=#FFFF00>This is all because of you!
All because of my damned good looks!</font>

259
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait... oh! My shoes!</font>

260
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my shoes! My shoes!</font>

261
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,360
<font color=#FFFF00>What is he doing?</font>

262
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,690
<font color=#FFFF00>To go so far just because of Ro Woon...</font>

263
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Se Jong! Se Jong!</font>

264
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh no! Oh no!</font>

265
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,190
<font color=#FFFF00>- Se Jong!
- Let go of me!</font>

266
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't go! It's dangerous!</font>

267
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,890
<font color=#FFFF00>How could I just let them go? No!</font>

268
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop acting like this!
It's not even worth that much!</font>

269
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Please, just let it go now!</font>

270
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:58,200
<font color=#FFFF00>No! My limited-edition sneakers!
It was so hard to get those!</font>

271
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,690
<font color=#FFFF00>Damn it, my shoes!</font>

272
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,490
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you'd grown to hate me, Gyo Ri.</font>

273
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I?</font>

274
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,090
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been acting distant ever since
you found out who my grandpa is.</font>

275
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, that's...</font>

276
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,390
<font color=#FFFF00>It's fine. That's what usually happens.</font>

277
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:30,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone treats me a bit differently
once they find out the truth about me.</font>

278
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,690
<font color=#FFFF00>They treat me better,
or end up hating me more.</font>

279
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,190
<font color=#FFFF00>At any rate, they treat me
differently than they did before.</font>

280
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,690
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like that...</font>

281
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:47,690
<font color=#FFFF00>But there's just one person who's
treated me the same through it all.</font>

282
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it Ro Woon?</font>

283
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,690
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right!</font>

284
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,200
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though it's a bit annoying
that it's her looking down on me.</font>

285
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,490
<font color=#FFFF00>That has remained constant.</font>

286
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for this.</font>

287
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, it was nothing.</font>

288
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I ask you just one thing, though?</font>

289
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did CEO Kang leave first?</font>

290
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, fine, then!
I'll shut my mouth.</font>

291
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,690
<font color=#FFFF00>- But, um...
- Red light.</font>

292
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,290
<font color=#FFFF00>What purpose does this system
even have if you're ignoring it?</font>

293
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Just one question!</font>

294
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Did I...</font>

295
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,790
<font color=#FFFF00>snore?</font>

296
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,580
<font color=#FFFF00>I did, didn't I?</font>

297
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,670
<font color=#FFFF00>You got all sensitive because you didn't
get any sleep because of me, right?</font>

298
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Was my snoring that bad?</font>

299
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Bad enough for you two to
leave me behind and leave the room?</font>

300
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Bad enough that CEO Kang
hates me now and left for Seoul?</font>

301
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,890
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no way!
It's not like that, right?</font>

302
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Right? It's not that bad, right?</font>

303
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,690
<font color=#FFFF00>But you know, Boss, that flower
looks really nice on you.</font>

304
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,590
<font color=#FFFF00>- I want to go there again.
- Let's go again, then.</font>

312
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, this?</font>

313
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Since college.</font>

314
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Why, did something happen?</font>

315
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it because of a woman, by any chance?</font>

316
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of pain you experienced
due to your first love?</font>

317
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Looks like I hit the mark!</font>

318
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,020
<font color=#FFFF00>What kind of woman was she?</font>

319
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Are there some painful memories
you have related to that, or something?</font>

320
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,730
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't need to know.</font>

321
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,130
<font color=#FFFF00>It definitely seems like him.</font>

322
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

323
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Looks like the barber's daughter
still hasn't come home yet.</font>

324
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,230
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a couple of days since she
left without even leaving a note behind!</font>

325
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:58,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Geez, he must really be upset.</font>

326
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,230
<font color=#FFFF00>She's finally back! She's back!</font>

327
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, yeah. She's back.</font>

328
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:19,130
<font color=#FFFF00>I bet he'll really give her
an earful this time!</font>

329
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:23,730
<font color=#FFFF00>He's been too soft on her.
He needs to teach her a lesson.</font>

330
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,930
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're right.
- Yep, yep!</font>

331
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead and yell with some
"oomph" to your heart's content!</font>

332
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you eat?</font>

333
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Um, yes. I did.</font>

334
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,130
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did he say?
- He asked her if she's eaten.</font>

335
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course she's eaten.</font>

336
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:15,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Looking at you reminds me
of someone I used to know.</font>

337
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though there aren't that many
similarities between you two.</font>

338
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Chief Park?</font>

342
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,180
<font color=#FFFF00>To think that he's off the market now...</font>

343
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,820
<font color=#FFFF00>He wasn't mine to begin with, though.</font>

344
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,070
<font color=#FFFF00>But why, all of the sudden?</font>

345
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,520
<font color=#FFFF00>It feels like this must be a lie!</font>

346
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,430
<font color=#FFFF00>But this is a letter that the
previous CEO himself sent out.</font>

347
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,020
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no way that this isn't true.</font>

348
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,130
<font color=#FFFF00>So he went ahead and made
an announcement like that.</font>

349
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,320
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you were aware
of this already, sir.</font>

00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations.</font>

353
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations, CEO Kang!</font>

354
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, thank you.</font>

355
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, you're here.</font>

356
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,680
<font color=#FFFF00>You announced that
we're getting married.</font>

357
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, I got busy
while waiting for you.</font>

358
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,970
<font color=#FFFF00>But you did that without telling me,
and while I wasn't even here.</font>

359
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,310
<font color=#FFFF00>- Can you step out for a bit?
- Yes, sir.</font>

360
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,730
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been inattentive toward you.</font>

361
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,130
<font color=#FFFF00>It wasn't because I hated you.</font>

362
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,520
<font color=#FFFF00>It was because I trust you,
and I feel comfortable with you.</font>

363
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Because I rely on you more
than I rely on my own son.</font>

364
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,520
<font color=#FFFF00>My son may have
done well this time around</font>

365
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,880
<font color=#FFFF00>but he still has a ways to go.</font>

366
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Put some more effort in so that Hwan Ki
can lead the company from the forefront.</font>

367
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,630
<font color=#FFFF00>The weight of the burdens you carried
alone until now must've been quite heavy.</font>

368
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that right?</font>

369
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,230
<font color=#FFFF00>So basically, you want Hwan Ki to be
in the spotlight more than me, right?</font>

370
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:33,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at you, acting all miffed
just because you got slapped once.</font>

371
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:40,430
<font color=#FFFF00>I find myself wishing that you were
my son dozens of times per day.</font>

372
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,430
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I'm even
giving you my daughter.</font>

373
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Father. Thank you for
your sentiments, but...</font>

374
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,310
<font color=#FFFF00>But in exchange, you can't
get greedy and want the company</font>

375
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:53,320
<font color=#FFFF00>or run for office just because
you're marrying into our family.</font>

376
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,060
<font color=#FFFF00>We still haven't figured out
who the whistleblower was</font>

377
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,430
<font color=#FFFF00>for the article about
Hwan Ki mistreating his employees.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Wool Il!</font>

379
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,940
<font color=#FFFF00>You were quite taken aback, weren't you?</font>

380
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom was saying things like, "What if
he has no intention of marrying you?"</font>

381
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,520
<font color=#FFFF00>And she kept acting
super sensitive about it</font>

382
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,730
<font color=#FFFF00>so I wanted to offer up an excuse,
but things ended up coming to this.</font>

383
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,430
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm sorry, but...
- No, I'm more sorry.</font>

384
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,820
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the best I can do regarding
pushing our marriage back.</font>

385
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Yi Soo.</font>

386
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay with me.</font>

387
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:40,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Just do this one thing for me.</font>

388
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,330
<font color=#FFFF00>I've really been had by Father.</font>

389
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,750
<font color=#FFFF00>I was fully aware that he did whatever
he pleased with people's lives, but...</font>

390
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,230
<font color=#FFFF00>My mind's a mess because
of Chae Ro Woon as it is.</font>

391
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,630
<font color=#FFFF00>And he announced my
marriage on top of all that.</font>

392
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's fire Chae Ro Woon.</font>

393
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Doing that is in her best interest, too.</font>

394
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't rush into things, and...</font>

395
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,770
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've done
something sooner, then.</font>

396
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,930
<font color=#FFFF00>If she does something like
leak intel to the press again...</font>

397
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,730
<font color=#FFFF00>She won't do anything else.</font>

398
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is she still here, then?</font>

399
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,230
<font color=#FFFF00>She might be trying to figure out
what happened three years ago!</font>

400
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,320
<font color=#FFFF00>If she finds out, then I...</font>

401
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,730
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that what you wanted
this whole time, by any chance?</font>

402
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you keeping her by your side
because that's my greatest weakness...</font>

403
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really think it'd be for that...</font>

404
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you keeping her by your side
if you need to protect her, then?</font>

405
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,430
<font color=#FFFF00>That just doesn't make any sense!</font>

406
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me some time, too.</font>

407
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:49,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? What are you thinking
about all by yourself now?</font>

408
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, come on. It's me.
You can tell me, can't you?</font>

409
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it bad enough that you backstabbed
me by keeping her identity a secret?</font>

410
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,320
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm always being exposed by you.</font>

411
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is it that you see right through me,
but I can't see through you?</font>

412

<font color=#FFFF00>CEO Kang!</font>

419
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something happen, Boss?</font>

420
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,730
<font color=#FFFF00>So a war has finally broken out,
is what it is.</font>

422

00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,130
<font color=#FFFF00>A bloody battle for power
between the son and the son-in-law.</font>

425
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Thus begins the first act.
With tons of bloodshed.</font>

426
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,130
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh my.
- Here you go, drink up.</font>

427
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,730
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks.</font>

428
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,030
<font color=#FFFF00>This tastes great!</font>

429
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

430
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:44,030
<font color=#FFFF00>But those two wouldn't normally be
fighting over something like that.</font>

431
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,230
<font color=#FFFF00>You never know with these things.</font>

432
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Even my mom argues with her sisters
over things like that all the time.</font>

433
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,340
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how it is.</font>

434
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,060
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like it'd be
much of a battle, though.</font>

435
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Exactly.</font>

436
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,420
<font color=#FFFF00>CEO Kang has achieved quite a lot.</font>

437
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,130
<font color=#FFFF00>CEO Eun Hwan Ki doesn't
have many people by his side.</font>

438
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,420
<font color=#FFFF00>- How pitiful.
- How pitiful, indeed.</font>

439
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,630
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like CEO Eun could
do anything without CEO Kang.</font>

440
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Bong. Get back here right now.</font>

441
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,130
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I think it's about time
that I picked a side.</font>

442
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep up the good work, then.</font>

443
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,230
<font color=#FFFF00>- Toodles.
- Excuse me!</font>

444
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:28,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Bong! Where are you going?</font>

445
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,630
<font color=#FFFF00>We must help him.</font>

446
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,850
<font color=#FFFF00>This is an old theater.</font>

447
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:41,590
<font color=#FFFF00>We've been asked to revamp it
as a theater that calls for movie mania.</font>

448
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:45,960
<font color=#FFFF00>It also happens that CEO Kang's team
is working on a theater project.</font>

449
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,830
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a chance to show
the ability of Silent Monster.</font>

450
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,900
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, do we have to decide
on a concept for the revamping?</font>

451
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,630
<font color=#FFFF00>If you just sit at your desk and write
some articles using your fingers...</font>

452
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,040
<font color=#FFFF00>you think that's promoting, huh?</font>

453
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:03,590
<font color=#FFFF00>If you work from planning
all the way through marketing...</font>

454
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,880
<font color=#FFFF00>that's when you can say,
"Now I know how to promote."</font>

455
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,030
<font color=#FFFF00>Ro Woon, go with
CEO Eun to the site first.</font>

456
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,280
<font color=#FFFF00>May I go with her?</font>

457
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:18,370
<font color=#FFFF00>- I think Ro Woon should go.
- Sure, I'm on it.</font>

458
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't I be allowed a glimpse
into your mind, too?</font>

459
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,140
<font color=#FFFF00>You fell for someone
you shouldn't have, didn't you?</font>

460
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Your employee.
And someone already loves her.</font>

461
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Red means "Don't come near." Got it?</font>

462
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Yellow means "Only for emergencies."</font>

463
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,500
<font color=#FFFF00>- Green...
- Does he ever have green on?</font>

464
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,920
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, seriously.</font>

465
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,210
<font color=#FFFF00>I will go over to the theater site first.</font>

466
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, I will come with you.</font>

467
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,440
<font color=#FFFF00>No, you seem to have
the red light on right now.</font>

468
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Do some thinking on your own.</font>

469
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,720
<font color=#FFFF00>When it turns to green, come.</font>

470
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Go.</font>

471
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,000
<font color=#FFFF00>Take your time.</font>

472
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,840
<font color=#FFFF00>- Go.
- I'm going.</font>

473
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,830
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Red light...</i></font>

474
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,660
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I've realized that I have to stop.</i></font>

475
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,220
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Even though I knew that...</i></font>

476
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,850
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder if the green light
has come up yet...</font>

477
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,030
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

478
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Eun Hwan Ki.</font>

479
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you really not see me?
Or were you pretending?</font>

480
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,320
<font color=#FFFF00>I was watching you the
whole time from the other side.</font>

481
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,400
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeon Jung.</font>

482
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,040
<font color=#FFFF00>It's always a "long time no see,"
every time we see each other.</font>

483
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,050
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Your call is being redirected...</i></font>

484
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,360
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't he at least answer the call?</font>

485
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Come to think of it,
I haven't talked to him on the phone.</font>

486
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:06,860
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. He has a phone phobia.</font>

487
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:30,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah, I recently saw you at the airport.</font>

488
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:34,360
<font color=#FFFF00>- It was you, right?
- Ah, at the airport?</font>

489
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,990
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't seem to notice me
and passed by me then, too.</font>

490
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I bet you don't
have the guts to face me.</font>

491
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,370
<font color=#FFFF00>After you stood me up
like that three years ago...</font>

492
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:50,300
<font color=#FFFF00>I was traumatized on Christmas.</font>

493
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,310
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm sorry. At that time...
- It's okay.</font>

494
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,850
<font color=#FFFF00>When the article about you being
bossy and entitled went viral</font>

495
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,910
<font color=#FFFF00>I wrote so many
hateful comments about you.</font>

496
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,500
<font color=#FFFF00>So we're even.</font>

497
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,670
<font color=#FFFF00>No way. It's not enough.</font>

498
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,810
<font color=#FFFF00>- Take me out for coffee.
- Coffee?</font>

499
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,350
<font color=#FFFF00>But I need to be somewhere right now.</font>

500
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:59,390
<font color=#FFFF00>What can I say?
You might not be able to run this time.</font>

501
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,860
<font color=#FFFF00>You happen to have coffee right here.</font>

502
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,880
<font color=#FFFF00>It's for somebody else.</font>

503
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:11,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry. I already drank it.</font>

504
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,590
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I was going to give it to Chae Ro Woon.</i></font>

505
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:16,420
<font color=#FFFF00>I will stop by your office
one of these days.</font>

506
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,810
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm trying to consult you
for the exhibition I'm planning.</font>

507
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:23,030
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not going to stand me up
when it's a client meeting.</font>

508
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:29,300
<font color=#FFFF00>I had my reasons three years ago.</font>

509
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah. And I know you
can't tell me the reasons.</font>

510
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,840
<font color=#FFFF00>If you could, you would've
told me three years ago.</font>

511
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,630
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, I was serious about work.</font>

512
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:45,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been looking for a PR firm.
So I'd appreciate it.</font>

513
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

514
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,490
<font color=#FFFF00>I will boss you around, so get ready.</font>

515
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,600
<font color=#FFFF00><i>This is me, here.</i></font>

516
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,290
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Should I take you home again?</i></font>

517
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it still a red light?</font>

518
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,130
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Chae Ryung.</i></font>

519
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,920
<font color=#FFFF00><i>- This...
- Thank you.</i></font>

520
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,600
<font color=#FFFF00><i>You really don't remember?</i></font>

521
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,150
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I... remember everything.</i></font>

522
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,090
<font color=#FFFF00><i>That's a lie.</i></font>

523
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,530
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Hey!</i></font>

524
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:15,370
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I'd like to stay next to her
like this a little longer.</i></font>

525
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,580
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Wouldn't it be okay to stay near her
while keeping this much distance?</i></font>

526
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,010
<font color=#FFFF00><i>[MOVIE TICKET FOR "DON'T FORGET ME"]</i></font>

527
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,870
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't come to the theater?</font>

528
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:23,150
<font color=#FFFF00>He said he'd definitely
go over there yesterday.</font>

529
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have something else to attend to?</font>

530
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,880
<font color=#FFFF00>He must have been with some other woman.</font>

531
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,280
<font color=#FFFF00>He's been smiling,
so he's in a good mood.</font>

532
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:51,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Then do you have
the green light on today, Boss?</font>

533
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Then can you take a look at my report?</font>

534
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,220
<font color=#FFFF00>According to the trend</font>

535
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,570
<font color=#FFFF00>I decided the concept
to be a virtual reality theater.</font>

536
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:04,400
<font color=#FFFF00>I've read it, but the thing is...</font>

537
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,910
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd understand if it were a game</font>

538
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,640
<font color=#FFFF00>but there aren't many
of those movies out.</font>

539
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,420
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems too early for it.</font>

540
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,390
<font color=#FFFF00><i>He's right.</i></font>

541
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Bong is on a
rampage of cynicism again.</font>

542
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,820
<font color=#FFFF00>As for virtual reality headsets</font>

543
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,430
<font color=#FFFF00>they can cause headaches and nausea
if people wear them for long.</font>

544
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:22,570
<font color=#FFFF00>How would you address that?</font>

545
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:25,380
<font color=#FFFF00>If people complain about lazy eyes
and fatigue, what will you do?</font>

546
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have a solution
to those side effects?</font>

547
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:32,020
<font color=#FFFF00><i>That can't be overlooked, either.</i></font>

548
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Then do you have any other ideas?</font>

549
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,470
<font color=#FFFF00>A unique concept that will start a mania?</font>

550
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,320
<font color=#FFFF00>- I have none.
- See?</font>

551
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,630
<font color=#FFFF00>What was that about?</font>

552
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:44,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Bong, you have no ideas, either.</font>

553
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:47,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Boss, can you say something?</font>

554
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,780
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to think about it.</font>

555
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,130
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to hurry up and set
the place up as the first and best.</font>

556
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah, that would be nice.</font>

557
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, all the "best," "most," "first"...</font>

558
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:12,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Koreans go crazy if a place
doesn't include those words.</font>

559
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,500
<font color=#FFFF00>They think they're done promoting
if it has those words.</font>

560
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,980
<font color=#FFFF00>They are so simple-minded.</font>

561
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,700
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I don't like how he describes it,
but he's not wrong.</i></font>

562
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,220
<font color=#FFFF00>I will take my time
and think more about it.</font>

563
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,090
<font color=#FFFF00>He really likes taking his time, huh?</font>

564
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess he's a red light again today.</font>

565
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,470
<font color=#FFFF00>As for that traffic light metaphor...</font>

566
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:43,020
<font color=#FFFF00>don't you think it's a bit childish?</font>

567
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,440
<font color=#FFFF00>An adult man has stickers all over him.</font>

568
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,070
<font color=#FFFF00>What is he, a pervert? It's embarrassing.</font>

569
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:51,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Plus, he's the leader...</font>

570
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,410
<font color=#FFFF00>but he communicates with us
only when he wants to.</font>

571
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:56,970
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Does that make sense?</i></font>

572
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,820
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Stop putting a damper on us.</i></font>

573
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,950
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I was going to stop anyway.</i></font>

574
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:23,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Gyo Ri, why are you fixing your makeup?</font>

575
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you meeting someone?
You're not, are you?</font>

576
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:29,990
<font color=#FFFF00>- Want to go out to dinner with me?
- Gyo Ri.</font>

577
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:31,660
<font color=#FFFF00>- Shall we go on a date?
- What?</font>

578
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:35,250
<font color=#FFFF00>- Me?
- Yes.</font>

579
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,810
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to take you out to a good dinner.</font>

580
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,360
<font color=#FFFF00>You look especially pretty today.</font>

581
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:46,340
<font color=#FFFF00><i>[VR MOVIE]</i></font>

582
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:49,970
<font color=#FFFF00>What's up with this sudden act?</font>

583
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,240
<font color=#FFFF00>- Just the two of you?
- Yes.</font>

584
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,470
<font color=#FFFF00>I have something to discuss,
just between us two.</font>

585
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,180
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's go, Gyo Ri.
- Sure.</font>

586
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,050
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's go.
- Okay.</font>

587
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:01,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

588
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go!</font>

589
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,910
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you like for dinner?</font>

590
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:09,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Anything is good.</font>

591
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:18,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo Hee, care for soju
and something spicy?</font>

592
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,420
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to go feed my kids.</font>

593
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Your sons will become someone
else's after they get married.</font>

594
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,220
<font color=#FFFF00>You should live your life.</font>

595
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,990
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't watch and laugh at others.</font>

596
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,110
<font color=#FFFF00>And live your life, okay?</font>

597
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:46,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, you still haven't moved on
from VR movie theater idea yet?</font>

598
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:49,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, if I give you advice,
will you buy me dinner?</font>

599
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,300
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

600
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,140
<font color=#FFFF00>I will go do more research on VR movies.</font>

601
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:58,090
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be leaving, then.</font>

602
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,120
<font color=#FFFF00>- Well...
- Sorry.</font>

603
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,050
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm leaving. Bye!</font>

604
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:09,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Why am I feeling a chill
on the back of my neck?</font>

605
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,940
<font color=#FFFF00><i>He seems to want to
eat dinner with someone.</i></font>

606
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:31,900
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Should I ask him to have dinner
with me, if he's okay with the idea?</i></font>

607
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,050
<font color=#FFFF00><i>No, he will be
uncomfortable alone with me.</i></font>

608
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:39,350
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Because I'm his boss,
he can't comfortably say no.</i></font>

609
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:41,950
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Then should I put on the green light on?</i></font>

610
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:45,030
<font color=#FFFF00><i>To signal that I'm willing,
if you want to.</i></font>

611
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,680
<font color=#FFFF00><i>But Sun Bong said
the traffic light idea was childish.</i></font>

612
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,140
<font color=#FFFF00><i>He's not wrong about that.</i></font>

613
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:54,460
<font color=#FFFF00><i>An adult man with colorful
stickers on is embarrassing.</i></font>

614
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:59,170
<font color=#FFFF00><i>But a childish approach can
sometimes improve a relationship.</i></font>

615
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:02,820
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Chae Ro Woon came up with this idea,
so I will gather my courage.</i></font>

616
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Uhm Sun Bong?</font>

617
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:37,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Uhm Sun Bong? Uhm Sun Bong.</font>

618
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Uhm Sun Bong.</font>

619
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:43,780
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Uhm Sun Bong. Uhm Sun Bong.</i></font>

620
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:48,290
<font color=#FFFF00>How can he not ever
take us out to dinner?</font>

621
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:54,300
<font color=#FFFF00>We went through life and death together.</font>

622
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,120
<font color=#FFFF00>It was all useless.</font>

623
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:59,660
<font color=#FFFF00>Hot! Damn it!</font>

624
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,300
<font color=#FFFF00>I will still eat it though.</font>

625
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:11,680
<font color=#FFFF00>In today's market...</font>

626
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,300
<font color=#FFFF00>VR movies bring you an experience,
regardless of limitation of space.</font>

627
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:21,220
<font color=#FFFF00>VR movies will change the paradigm that
the movie industry's had for 120 years.</font>

628
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow.</font>

629
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:25,610
<font color=#FFFF00>That first step to the innovation
towards a new generation...</font>

630
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:28,880
<font color=#FFFF00>we'll be the first in
the country to take it.</font>

631
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,970
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm CEO Kang Woo Il
of Brain PR. Thank you.</font>

632
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,150
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew it.</font>

633
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,180
<font color=#FFFF00>They took the title of "first" away
right before our eyes.</font>

634
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:53,850
<font color=#FFFF00>You said it was so old-fashioned
to hang on to being a "first."</font>

635
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:00,460
<font color=#FFFF00>If the people on top made decisions,
we could proceed and work smoothly.</font>

636
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:04,230
<font color=#FFFF00>But our boss takes his time
to just come up with an idea.</font>

637
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,090
<font color=#FFFF00>The power struggle
between the son and son-in-law.</font>

638
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:09,190
<font color=#FFFF00>For the first round,
the victory goes to CEO Kang.</font>

639
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,470
<font color=#FFFF00>I liked Ro Woon's idea.</font>

640
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:14,700
<font color=#FFFF00>You put a lot of work into it.
You must be sad.</font>

641
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

642
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:27,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Our boss should have some kind of idea.</font>

643
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:29,380
<font color=#FFFF00>He should definitely have a counter-plan.</font>

644
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:32,680
<font color=#FFFF00>You have no idea at all?</font>

645
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,500
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been thinking all this time.</font>

646
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:40,000
<font color=#FFFF00>You had the red light on
because you were thinking.</font>

647
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's all think about it together
starting from this moment.</font>

648
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,230
<font color=#FFFF00>It's spooky, like a ghost might appear.</font>

649
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,530
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so vintage in here, huh?</font>

650
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:14,580
<font color=#FFFF00>What's with this old smell?</font>

651
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:24,320
<font color=#FFFF00>My back and butt will feel stiff in here.</font>

652
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,430
<font color=#FFFF00>The space between
these chairs is so narrow.</font>

653
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:33,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I like it because I can
sit close to my girl.</font>

654
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

655
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,870
<font color=#FFFF00>When did they become that cozy?</font>

656
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:45,070
<font color=#FFFF00>When one born
with a silver spoon gets mad</font>

657
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,590
<font color=#FFFF00>the clueless one snatches the bait.</font>

658
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,200
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

659
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you decided to
go out with Jang Se Jong?</font>

660
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:04,220
<font color=#FFFF00>The truth is...</font>

661
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:07,750
<font color=#FFFF00>he asked me to pretend
to go out with him.</font>

662
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:08,850
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

663
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:13,230
<font color=#FFFF00>He wants to make you jealous.</font>

664
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:16,320
<font color=#FFFF00>He wants to show you
how he makes a woman happy</font>

665
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,890
<font color=#FFFF00>and how endlessly nice
he can be to a woman.</font>

666
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:28,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, why don't you tell him
honestly how you feel?</font>

667
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:37,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Not everybody can be honest
with their feelings, like you.</font>

668
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:43,920
<font color=#FFFF00>People tell me so easily to
be confident and courageous.</font>

669
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,830
<font color=#FFFF00>That's only possible
if there is someone to hear you out.</font>

670
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:54,610
<font color=#FFFF00>No one is willing to hear me out.</font>

671
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:57,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you say that...</font>

672
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you just pretend not to know?</font>

673
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,930
<font color=#FFFF00>If Se Jong wants to
make me happy this way...</font>

674
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:10,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Who else would want
to be that nice to me?</font>

675
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:16,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Gyo Ri...</font>

676
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,110
<font color=#FFFF00>It'll be hard to attract customers</font>

677
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,600
<font color=#FFFF00>without a unique idea
like the VR theater.</font>

678
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,240
<font color=#FFFF00>I agree. It still bothers me
that our idea was stolen.</font>

679
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,520
<font color=#FFFF00>It would've made news
as the first in the country.</font>

680
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:41,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Although we lost
"first," "most," and "best"</font>

681
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:46,920
<font color=#FFFF00>I was just reminded of
the perfect keyword.</font>

682
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,550
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

683
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:50,870
<font color=#FFFF00>The worst.</font>

684
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:55,330
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gosh, what is that?
- Why are you starting again?</font>

685
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:59,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Since we can't provide
the best service and facility</font>

686
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,960
<font color=#FFFF00>why don't we give them the worst impact?</font>

687
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's not spend
unnecessarily for remodeling.</font>

688
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Why not a theater
specializing in horror films?</font>

689
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,150
<font color=#FFFF00>In the worst movie theater...</font>

690
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:19,570
<font color=#FFFF00>experience an
unforgettable night of horror.</font>

691
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:22,180
<font color=#FFFF00>- Horror?
- Coming soon...</font>

692
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,310
<font color=#FFFF00>That's good.</font>

693
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,090
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pardon?
- Pardon?</font>

694
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:30,350
<font color=#FFFF00>I said, I liked it.</font>

695
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:34,180
<font color=#FFFF00>We will proceed
according to Sun Bong's idea.</font>

696
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:37,090
<font color=#FFFF00>What idea? The one I just came up with?</font>

697
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:41,120
<font color=#FFFF00>I was just saying that to be sarcastic...</font>

698
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:46,430
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a brilliant idea to twist
the obvious promotional strategy.</font>

699
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:50,190
<font color=#FFFF00>- No, we were just being funny...
- We were being funny...</font>

700
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,800
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't do that.</font>

701
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,660
<font color=#FFFF00>You were being funny. It was funny.</font>

702
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:59,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Uhm Sun Bong is a man of wit.</font>

703
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I?</font>

704
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:06,090
<font color=#FFFF00>What was that?
He took Sun Bong's idea seriously?</font>

705
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:09,620
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh my.
- I'm shocked.</font>

706
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Sun Bong, what did you just say?</font>

707
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:15,940
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Finally, the light's turned green.</i></font>

708
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:40,760
<font color=#FFFF00>I created the promotion phrases.</font>

709
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:47,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Women might hate going to the "worst"
kind of movie theater on a date night</font>

710
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:53,650
<font color=#FFFF00>so I thought how we could test the
strength of the seat backs for the guys.</font>

711
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:55,380
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

712
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,920
<font color=#FFFF00>We should appeal to the female customers.</font>

713
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,390
<font color=#FFFF00>- That sounds good.
- Okay.</font>

714
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:04,520
<font color=#FFFF00>There is something else.</font>

715
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:11,130
<font color=#FFFF00>It would be a design that would prevent
the men from spreading their legs.</font>

716
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,640
<font color=#FFFF00>He finally smiled.</font>

717
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,220
<font color=#FFFF00>I have others too.</font>

718
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:22,800
<font color=#FFFF00>- I have a different version.
- Ah, do you?</font>

719
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Since we're trying to
stick with the "worst" idea...</font>

720
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:34,270
<font color=#FFFF00>People tell me so easily
to be confident and courageous.</font>

721
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,700
<font color=#FFFF00>That's only possible
if someone can hear you out.</font>

722
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Who knew?</font>

723
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he eat something weird?</font>

724
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:07,410
<font color=#FFFF00>He's been at his desk for hours now.</font>

725
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,310
<font color=#FFFF00>He looks cool though.</font>

726
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:22,330
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Boss is someone
who is willing to hear you out.</i></font>

727
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:26,180
<font color=#FFFF00>The worst movie theater...</font>

728
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:31,610
<font color=#FFFF00>I can disappoint you more
than you can even imagine.</font>

729
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:34,030
<font color=#FFFF00>You can kick someone
in the row in front of you.</font>

730
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:36,210
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay to leave your phone on.</font>

731
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,680
<font color=#FFFF00>You can drink and even dance, too.</font>

732
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,700
<font color=#FFFF00>If a scary monster appears on the screen</font>

733
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,390
<font color=#FFFF00>you can throw your popcorn at it.</font>

734
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,670
<font color=#FFFF00>- Good work.
- You're doing well.</font>

735
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:53,470
<font color=#FFFF00>How long do we have to fit into
the mold others set for us?</font>

736
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:58,720
<font color=#FFFF00>We can have one "worst day,"
other than a "best day."</font>

737
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,030
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's right.
- There you go!</font>

738
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:03,400
<font color=#FFFF00>William Shakespeare said this.</font>

739
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,040
<font color=#FFFF00>"If you have the presence of mind
to say, 'This is the worst'"</font>

740
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,740
<font color=#FFFF00>"then it’s not the worst yet."</font>

741
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:12,960
<font color=#FFFF00>The worst is when you
can't even say that word.</font>

742
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:20,110
<font color=#FFFF00>You still have the energy
to overcome the worst!</font>

743
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:24,320
<font color=#FFFF00>So enjoy being the worst.</font>

744
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:31,660
<font color=#FFFF00>The worst horror movie theater,
Horror Shakill!</font>

745
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Awesome!</font>

746
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:36,550
<font color=#FFFF00>- You did it!
- You did it!</font>

747
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:40,880
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The reason why he was quiet...</i></font>

748
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:49,010
<font color=#FFFF00><i>maybe it wasn't because he didn't
want to talk, but wanted to hear us out.</i></font>

749
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,250
<font color=#FFFF00>What was that?</font>

750
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:14,820
<font color=#FFFF00>- High five.
- High five?</font>

751
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,240
<font color=#FFFF00>- On my back?
- Then, with my hand?</font>

752
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Help me clean up.</font>

753
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:27,510
<font color=#FFFF00>- You scared me.
- Did you come to steal our idea again?</font>

754
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,450
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

755
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:34,620
<font color=#FFFF00>We were already working on a VR theater.</font>

756
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:37,750
<font color=#FFFF00>Our boss took his time,
not approving it!</font>

757
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:40,950
<font color=#FFFF00>We still don't have
enough movies for a VR theater.</font>

758
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:43,380
<font color=#FFFF00>This single movie theater
can't support it financially.</font>

759
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,220
<font color=#FFFF00>CEO Eun made the right decision.</font>

760
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:50,290
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not paying attention
to work because of Ro Woon.</font>

761
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,300
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you just say?</font>

762
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Haven't you noticed
how happy he is lately?</font>

763
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:57,220
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you didn't know there was
something going on between them.</font>

764
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have anything to say?</font>

765
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up and finish.</font>

766
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:19,470
<font color=#FFFF00>"Wow, you're good.
Where did you learn how to do this?"</font>

767
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:21,960
<font color=#FFFF00>"Thank you for saving the expense."</font>

768
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:25,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Others say that to me.</font>

769
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:26,900
<font color=#FFFF00>I just want you to know.</font>

770
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,070
<font color=#FFFF00>I agree, it's the minimum.</font>

771
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:32,420
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to scare other people.</font>

772
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:38,060
<font color=#FFFF00>You're scary people enough
with your black hoodie.</font>

773
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:41,630
<font color=#FFFF00>I will look in the mirror.
I'm too nervous.</font>

774
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:43,820
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let me look in the mirror.
- Close your eyes.</font>

775
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Now I will work on your eyes.</font>

776
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:51,170
<font color=#FFFF00>A bit of this.</font>

777
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,080
<font color=#FFFF00>Close your eyes so I can get them.</font>

778
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:21,860
<font color=#FFFF00>How shocking that you
willingly took off your hood.</font>

779
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:53,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you not avoiding eye contact?</font>

780
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,730
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I'm avoiding it.</i></font>

781
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:03,430
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not going to close your eyes?</font>

782
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:08,530
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I'm avoiding it with all my might.</i></font>

783
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:28,200
<font color=#FFFF00>This feels like we're
fighting in a weird way.</font>

784
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,920
<font color=#FFFF00>If one of us looks the other way</font>

785
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,400
<font color=#FFFF00>it means we lose,
so we can't do anything now?</font>

786
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:40,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you just close them?</font>

787
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,370
<font color=#FFFF00>The brush could poke them.</font>
