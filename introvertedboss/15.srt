<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Let's eat.</font>

5

6
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,510
<font color=#FFFF00>It's good.</font>

7
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,970
<font color=#FFFF00>That's a relief.</font>

8
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,320
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, Dad. I wish you'd start
telling me what you're thinking.</font>

9
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,200

continue working there?</font>

17
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,590

they'll acknowledge my worth.</font>

18
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,580
<font color=#FFFF00>I found someone who understands me</font>

19
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,120
<font color=#FFFF00>and I found a place
that acknowledges my worth.</font>

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,170
<font color=#FFFF00>And Ji Hye was the one
who made it happen.</font>

21
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,190
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I think.</font>

22
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,500
<font color=#FFFF00>But I heard that necklace
wasn't even a gift from Ji Hye.</font>

23
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,210
<font color=#FFFF00>But instead,
I received a prettier necklace.</font>

24
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,430

27
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,400

It's because you want to talk, right?</font>

- Tell me.</font>

29

and quiet by yourself.</font>

30
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,530

that makes other people feel?</font>

31
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,040
<font color=#FFFF00>- Really?
- Are you really asking me that?</font>

32
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,480

you to understand me?</font>

33
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,920
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to understand you too.</font>

34

everyone else is thinking</font>

35
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,350

36
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I wasn't reading anyone.</font>

37
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I guess I did often
try to go the easy route.</font>

38
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:49,270
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I could see what everyone
was feeling. That I could read it.</font>

39
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,410
<font color=#FFFF00>But it wasn't true.</font>

40
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,040

I knew and understood them.</font>

41
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,250
<font color=#FFFF00>But it was dangerous.</font>

42

- I'm talking about Secretary Chae.</font>

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Please.</font>

147
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Please... pick up.</font>

148
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:47,630
<font color=#FFFF00><i>The number is unavailable.
Please leave a message after the tone...</i></font>

149
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,000
<font color=#FFFF00>CEO... CEO Eun.</font>

150
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,540
<font color=#FFFF00>The intended recipient
of Ji Hye's drawing...</font>

151
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,770
<font color=#FFFF00>was not CEO Kang, but you.</font>

152
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,460
<font color=#FFFF00>- What are you drawing?
- Um...</font>

153
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,750
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a view that someone
is always looking at.</font>

154
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,590
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I thought there were always
a lot of people around CEO Kang.</i></font>

155
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:31,940
<font color=#FFFF00><i>I thought that was why she drew
a picture of many people in a building.</i></font>

156
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,010
<font color=#FFFF00><i>But it wasn't true...</i></font>

157
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,490
<font color=#FFFF00>CEO Eun.</font>

158
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,760
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

159
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I'm just...</font>

160
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,290
<font color=#FFFF00>I realized, on your window sill...</font>

161
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,910
<font color=#FFFF00>there's no dust. It's clean.</font>

162
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,150
<font color=#FFFF00>I do the cleaning.
You don't have to worry about that.</font>

163
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I apologize.</font>

164
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,870
<font color=#FFFF00>The view that you always
admire outside your window.</font>

165
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,660
<font color=#FFFF00>The flower shop and bakery
on the first floor...</font>

166
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,170
<font color=#FFFF00>A cafe on the second floor...</font>

167
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,340
<font color=#FFFF00>And a hair salon on the third floor.</font>

168
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that right?</font>

169
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess...</font>

170
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,370
<font color=#FFFF00>she wanted to fill that
concrete building with people.</font>

171
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Because you're always alone...</font>

172
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:55,520
<font color=#FFFF00>I think she wanted
warm people to be by your side.</font>

173
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

174
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Take it.</font>

175
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,550
<font color=#FFFF00>The picture finally found
its rightful owner.</font>

176
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,510
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you looking at me like that?</font>

177
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,890
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's just... that you look different.</font>

178
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,940
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never seen you
so laid back, even at home.</font>

179
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,620
<font color=#FFFF00>It wakes you up, doesn't it?</font>

180
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,420
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

181
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,310
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the real me.</font>

182
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,450
<font color=#FFFF00>No, you look comfortable.</font>

183
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,610
<font color=#FFFF00>I am.</font>

184
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,950
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have to dress up
because I'm always at home.</font>

185
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,930
<font color=#FFFF00>And I don't have to say
what I don't want to say.</font>

186
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:16,180
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have to strain myself because
of what others might think either.</font>

187
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,320
<font color=#FFFF00>You're always home?</font>

188
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom and Dad want me
to stay home for the time being.</font>

189
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,620
<font color=#FFFF00>- They must be embarrassed of me.
- Hey, no way.</font>

190
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,910
<font color=#FFFF00>They're worried...</font>

191
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:34,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, I sneaked out just now,
so I have to go back soon.</font>

192
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you call me here?</font>

193
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,120
<font color=#FFFF00>I... was worried about you.</font>

194
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,710
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't think you
were lacking in any way.</font>

195
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,280
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you were someone
who didn't need my help.</font>

196
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:04,120
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why when you did anything
for me, I took it for granted...</font>

197
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,280
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

198
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,450
<font color=#FFFF00>I even found it bothersome at times.</font>

199
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't even know I hurt you so much.</font>

200
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,890
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I feel so bad.</font>

201
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget it.</font>

202
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,590
<font color=#FFFF00>It wasn't because of you.</font>

203
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. You're doing it again.</font>

204
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,790
<font color=#FFFF00>You're being considerate to me again.</font>

205
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,280
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you were
comfortable not dressing up.</font>

206
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,380
<font color=#FFFF00>You're prettier...</font>

207
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,420
<font color=#FFFF00>than ever before.</font>

208
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,100
<font color=#FFFF00>So stop holding it in.</font>

209
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,100
<font color=#FFFF00>If you have something to say, say it.</font>

210
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

211
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,890
<font color=#FFFF00>It was all because of you.</font>

212
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,160
<font color=#FFFF00>I hate you.</font>

213
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,480
<font color=#FFFF00>That's better.</font>

214
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,580
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's still weak.</font>

215
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,340
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want you to be happy without me.</font>

216
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,430
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you fail in life.</font>

217
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,910
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that all? I don't think it's enough.</font>

218
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep going.</font>

219
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,170
<font color=#FFFF00>You mean bastard. You son of a bitch!</font>

220
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,090
<font color=#FFFF00>You bastard.</font>

221
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Yeah.</font>

222
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,830
<font color=#FFFF00>I deserve at least that.</font>

223
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,740
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't think I'd see you again.</font>

224
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,390
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you'd run away
if I told the truth.</font>

225
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,150
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought it'd all be over.</font>

226
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Geez.</font>

227
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,010
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you taking?
Health is also a skill.</font>

228
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I'm not sick.
These are diet pills.</font>

229
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,990
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who are you trying to impress?
- It's not like that!</font>

230
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,050
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to change.</font>

231
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,930
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to take care of myself
and love myself from now on.</font>

232
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,980
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing later tonight?</font>

233
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,830
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, tonight...</font>

234
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,000
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure you don't have plans. I know.</font>

235
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't sit in your room checking other
people's relationship statuses, okay?</font>

236
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Geez, I really thought
about you for this one.</font>

237
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

238
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,650
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

239
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,520
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a concert
that Brain PR is working on.</font>

240
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Go see it. I'll go with you.</font>

241
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,790
<font color=#FFFF00>Geez, I'm such a great colleague.</font>

242
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:32,590
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm thankful,
but I have prior commitments.</font>

243
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,310
<font color=#FFFF00>With whom?</font>

244
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,760
<font color=#FFFF00>- With myself.
- What?</font>

245
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,700
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a lecture on promotions
tonight that I'm going to.</font>

246
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,130
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Since when do you go to those?</font>

247
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Since now! I told you!</font>

248
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,700
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to take care of myself
and love myself from now on.</font>

249
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go together next time.</font>

250
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,420
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait...</font>

251
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

252
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

253
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, approach her in a warm way.</font>

254
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:15,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Gyo Ri is delicate,
so she'll be attracted to a warm man.</font>

255
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,600
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you have this wrong.</font>

256
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you trying to be a bad guy by joking
and saying what you don't mean?</font>

257
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,740
<font color=#FFFF00>That makes you a horrible person!</font>

258
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,030
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

259
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to this.</font>

260
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,230
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh! These are concert tickets! Hey!</font>

261
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:40,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks! I should go
to this with my husband.</font>

262
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,450
<font color=#FFFF00>These are diet pills.</font>

263
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:52,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Um, about that lecture.
May I come with you?</font>

264
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh.</font>

265
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you like to come?</font>

266
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:00,580
<font color=#FFFF00>In exchange, I'll buy dinner.</font>

267
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,660
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay.
- Let's go.</font>

268
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,180
<font color=#FFFF00>See? What did I tell you?
Gosh, you're so lacking!</font>

269
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to me?</font>

270
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,190
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, have some chocolates instead.</font>

271
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,300
<font color=#FFFF00>- I hate sweet things!
- Eat it and get yourself together!</font>

272
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,920
<font color=#FFFF00>- Stop this!
- Wake up!</font>

273
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,360
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to you, I had a
valuable time learning about PR.</font>

274
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,010
<font color=#FFFF00>But you dozed off the whole time.</font>

275
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:44,150
<font color=#FFFF00>Geez, why am I in this state?</font>

276
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:49,430
<font color=#FFFF00>All of our team members have found
their place and have started to grow.</font>

277
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,560
<font color=#FFFF00>But all I do is get into accidents.</font>

278
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,610
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you had another dream
of becoming a celebrity.</font>

279
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,480
<font color=#FFFF00>That's true.</font>

280
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,720
<font color=#FFFF00>But I still feel like...</font>

281
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,350
<font color=#FFFF00>we're getting more distant.</font>

282
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:11,170
<font color=#FFFF00>And these days,
I feel like you're older than me.</font>

283
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Once you also start on
your path to your true dream</font>

284
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,340
<font color=#FFFF00>you will change too.</font>

285
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,090
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?
You're pushing me out too easily.</font>

286
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:28,020
<font color=#FFFF00>- I guess you feel no affection.
- What do you mean?</font>

287
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,380
<font color=#FFFF00>- I used to like you.
- That's why...</font>

288
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,200
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

289
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,380
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you like stop by my house?</font>

290
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:41,780
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait, excuse me? All of a sudden?
Your parents must be home.</font>

291
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,250
<font color=#FFFF00>Um, wait.</font>

293
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew you'd have that expression.</font>

294
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,650
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because of where I live, isn't it?</font>

295
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Me? Not at all.</font>

296
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,190
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a rooftop room,
the symbol of dreams.</font>

297
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,330
<font color=#FFFF00>You know, young adults
who have dreams and passions</font>

298
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,650
<font color=#FFFF00>all live in rooftop rooms like this one.</font>

299
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,510
<font color=#FFFF00>- I've always wanted to do it.
- You're exaggerating.</font>

300
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:32,730
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew you'd react this way,
which was why I couldn't confess to you.</font>

301
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

302
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,310
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't realize how you felt.</font>

303
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,800
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's fine. I'm sorry.</font>

304
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,520
<font color=#FFFF00>When we were pretending to date</font>

305
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,830
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have developed
those one-sided feelings.</font>

306
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,430
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to return the clothes
you bought me.</font>

307
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,250
<font color=#FFFF00>But why?</font>

308
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Take it.</font>

309
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,330
<font color=#FFFF00>It's really over now.</font>

310
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:06,030
<font color=#FFFF00>But we didn't even start.</font>

311
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though it was fake</font>

312
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,510
<font color=#FFFF00>I was thankful to you.</font>

313
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:32,530
<font color=#FFFF00>I confessed,
and now I have no feelings left.</font>

314
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Get home safely.</font>

315
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,570
<font color=#FFFF00>Last time, Hwan Ki took all my dishes</font>

316
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,120
<font color=#FFFF00>and today, it's you?</font>

317
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,280
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not here to see you,
so don't worry about it.</font>

318
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here to volunteer too.</font>

319
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to someone,
I feel very ill inside!</font>

320
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:17,790
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's cold.
- I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.</font>

321
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,980
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried about how Hwan Ki is doing.</font>

322
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure he's fine.</font>

323
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:33,730
<font color=#FFFF00>He has someone who's always
knocking and dragging him outside.</font>

324
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:38,550
<font color=#FFFF00>But even if that's true,
it won't be easy.</font>

325
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,310
<font color=#FFFF00>We were all stupid.</font>

326
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:52,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Not one of us truly told anyone
how we really felt.</font>

327
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,350
<font color=#FFFF00>I know.</font>

328
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,100
<font color=#FFFF00>- But you're something else, Kang Woo Il.
- "Kang Woo Il"?</font>

329
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,260
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't see me as older anymore?</font>

330
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,990
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I just thought about it.</font>

331
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Three years ago, Secretary Chae
was actually interested in someone else</font>

332
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,480
<font color=#FFFF00>but you misunderstood
and pursued her all by yourself.</font>

333
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

334
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,800
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know if I should say this...</font>

335
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,830
<font color=#FFFF00>but it serves you right!</font>

336
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:26,060
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, you're not afraid to say anything
anymore. You're starting to scare me.</font>

337
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,330
<font color=#FFFF00>I know, right?
Why did you have to open me up?</font>

338
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,690
<font color=#FFFF00>The same goes for Hwan Ki.</font>

339
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,310
<font color=#FFFF00>After his doors open,
they won't close so easily.</font>

340
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,020
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so dumb.</font>

341
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,980
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you keep going? Try me.</font>

342
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,580
<font color=#FFFF00>This is Reporter Woo,
who's been attacking you all this time.</font>

343
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,190
<font color=#FFFF00>He used to be a reporter
at a major newspaper company.</font>

344
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,600
<font color=#FFFF00>He was a close friend of the secretary
who killed herself three years ago.</font>

345
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,530
<font color=#FFFF00>And I found out something
while I was digging for information.</font>

346
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,540
<font color=#FFFF00>The late Secretary Chae's sister
is working at Brain PR.</font>

347
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,680
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

348
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,900
<font color=#FFFF00>Since the news broke out
about CEO Eun's entitlement</font>

349
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,330
<font color=#FFFF00>it seems she's been giving
information to Reporter Woo.</font>

350
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Please stop doing that.</font>

351
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,870
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't have the space for them.</font>

352
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,300
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if you do all this</font>

353
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Ro Woon won't budge.</font>

354
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Come inside.</font>

355
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,320
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I should tell you</font>

356
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,750
<font color=#FFFF00>that there is no point in
you coming by from now on.</font>

357
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,700
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm closing the shop soon.</font>

358
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,260
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon? Why so suddenly?</font>

359
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,310
<font color=#FFFF00>The owner of the building has changed.</font>

360
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,060
<font color=#FFFF00>They raised the rent ridiculously high.</font>

361
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,720
<font color=#FFFF00>He's getting fewer customers, gosh.</font>

362
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,920
<font color=#FFFF00>He's been here for the last 30 years.</font>

363
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,000
<font color=#FFFF00>How could this happen overnight?</font>

364
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:54,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know why Ro Woon
locked herself in again.</font>

365
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:00,550
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks as if you two are
not meant to be together.</font>

366
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,850
<font color=#FFFF00>Just let it go.</font>

367
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,100
<font color=#FFFF00>Now I can see it was
all about that girl, huh?</font>

368
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she talk you into throwing Woo Il out
since he made her sister kill herself?</font>

369
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,270
<font color=#FFFF00>She didn't talk me into doing that.</font>

370
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,510
<font color=#FFFF00>You sure need a lot of care.</font>

371
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,600
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you do something to
New York Barber, by any chance?</font>

372
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,880
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you do that?</font>

373
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,380
<font color=#FFFF00>They have nothing left.</font>

374
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you really have to do that to them?</font>

375
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,720
<font color=#FFFF00>You saw how troubled Yi Soo became.</font>

376
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:24,610
<font color=#FFFF00>True. What happened to Yi Soo
made me realize something.</font>

377
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,200
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to find your match myself.</font>

378
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,960
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pardon?
- Wow!</font>

379
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Right on time.</font>

380
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,770
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yeon Jung.
- Hello, I'm Seo Yeon Jung.</font>

381
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,970
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for making
the time to come out.</font>

382
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:50,140
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no patience and
wanted to meet you quickly.</font>

383
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,280
<font color=#FFFF00>Please have a seat.</font>

384
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,320
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

385
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,530
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't know I was coming?</font>

386
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:02,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, if you were seeing her,
you should've told me sooner.</font>

387
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,460
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you make me get involved?</font>

388
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,340
<font color=#FFFF00>You know how shy Hwan Ki is.</font>

389
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,480
<font color=#FFFF00>I should've come to see you first.</font>

390
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,580
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you two knew
each other in college, huh?</font>

391
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,780
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not in such a relationship.</font>

392
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:20,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I tried to go out with him
back then and I'm still trying now.</font>

393
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,460
<font color=#FFFF00>I really like him.</font>

394
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,350
<font color=#FFFF00>I like how straightforward you are.</font>

395
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:30,650
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to make you my
daughter-in-law as soon as possible.</font>

396
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,900
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you say?
Would you marry Hwan Ki?</font>

397
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Marry Hwan Ki?</font>

398
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,160
<font color=#FFFF00>Just the thought makes me happy.</font>

399
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me, but...</font>

400
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,210
<font color=#FFFF00>But what can I say?
I wouldn't like my future father-in-law.</font>

401
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,030
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

402
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,180
<font color=#FFFF00>I like how careful Hwan Ki is.</font>

403
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,760
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a bit slow,
but he's considerate of others.</font>

404
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,840
<font color=#FFFF00>That's just because...</font>

405
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,930
<font color=#FFFF00>But you're very different from him.</font>

406
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:08,390
<font color=#FFFF00>You're more vigorous and impatient
with an impelling drive.</font>

407
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,560
<font color=#FFFF00>Since I'm more like that,
I wouldn't like someone similar.</font>

408
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,470
<font color=#FFFF00>I appreciate you thinking highly of me
and asking me out here.</font>

409
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,930
<font color=#FFFF00>But I thought you'd talk to him first.</font>

410
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:28,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Seeing you push forward this urgently...</font>

411
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:31,640
<font color=#FFFF00>I assume you already looked into me.</font>

412
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

413
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Since we're talking about it,
I'll be upfront.</font>

414
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:39,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Can we not live with you guys
after we get married?</font>

415
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,150
<font color=#FFFF00>We will come over
on major holidays and such.</font>

416
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,640
<font color=#FFFF00>Does your family hold memorial
services for your ancestors?</font>

417
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,950
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not good at making such dishes.</font>

418
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,670
<font color=#FFFF00>I admit that I was too hasty.</font>

419
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,570
<font color=#FFFF00>I was too rude, wasn't I?</font>

420
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,770
<font color=#FFFF00>But I really don't think this is the way.</font>

421
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:05,930
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry I made you uncomfortable.</font>

422
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:10,860
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this the start of my sad love story</font>

423
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,540
<font color=#FFFF00>where I go against
my family's wishes?</font>

424
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,210
<font color=#FFFF00><i>[NEW YORK BARBER]</i></font>

425
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,850
<font color=#FFFF00>What's all that?</font>

426
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,910
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to keep this place alive.</font>

427
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:49,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually, I have
experience in promotions.</font>

428
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:55,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe it's time to get out
of this tiny barbershop.</font>

429
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,560
<font color=#FFFF00>You've also felt suffocated.</font>

430
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,670
<font color=#FFFF00>This is where your whole
life story is written.</font>

443
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,940

444
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,080

<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do that.</font>

447
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,000
<font color=#FFFF00>What? You're not Boss?</font>

448
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you Jang Se Jong then?</font>

449
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,980
<font color=#FFFF00>No way. You're Boss. Let me see then.</font>

450
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,550
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

451
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,390

464
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,360
<font color=#FFFF00>You're Jang Se Jong.
I can't talk to you that way?</font>

465
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,120
<font color=#FFFF00>That's enough, Boss.</font>

466
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,350
<font color=#FFFF00>It must be hard, so take it off, okay?</font>

467
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:05,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Seriously, hold still.</font>

468
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Now reveal yourself!</font>

469
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:10,930

<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?
Let me go, Boss.</font>

471
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,380
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

472
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:28,630
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you just think this isn't me?</font>

473
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:37,500
<font color=#FFFF00>I just want to see your face once.</font>

474
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I see your face
even if it's like this?</font>

475
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,230
<font color=#FFFF00>I've missed you so much.</font>

476
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:04,550

00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,960

479
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,520
<font color=#FFFF00>No Ah, let's go.</font>

480
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:30,960
<font color=#FFFF00>After this, just go.</font>

481
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,990
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you missed me.</font>

482
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,520
<font color=#FFFF00>Missing you is one thing.</font>

483
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,790
<font color=#FFFF00>But the fact we can't be together
is an entirely different matter.</font>

484
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Here. Since I have a very low
budget for this promotion</font>

485
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,440
<font color=#FFFF00>this is all I can afford.</font>

486
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for coming though.</font>

487
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,910
<font color=#FFFF00>No need to thank me.</font>

488
00:49:54,290 --> 00:50:00,470
<font color=#FFFF00>It was my father who made
things difficult for the barbershop.</font>

489
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:05,000
<font color=#FFFF00>What? How could he?</font>

490
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,290
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

491
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:11,450
<font color=#FFFF00>Now there is one more
reason it can't be me.</font>

492
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,530
<font color=#FFFF00>But I still came.</font>

493
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:21,720
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if I shouldn't,
I decided to do it anyway.</font>

494
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,290
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if you come this way, I can't...</font>

495
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:32,040
<font color=#FFFF00>All this time, it was you who came to me.</font>

496
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,420
<font color=#FFFF00>You believed in me
without knowing what I was up to.</font>

497
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,530
<font color=#FFFF00>After you learned the truth,
you easily forgave me.</font>

498
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:45,660
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay to lock yourself in.</font>

499
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:49,620
<font color=#FFFF00>All the things you did for me,
such as knocking on my door...</font>

500
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:56,280
<font color=#FFFF00>making sure I was okay,
and taking me out of my room.</font>

501
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:59,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I will do all that from now on.</font>

502
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:08,960
<font color=#FFFF00>How am I supposed to face my late sister?</font>

503
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:10,880
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't do that.</font>

504
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I will do what you can't do.</font>

505
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:17,720
<font color=#FFFF00>I will be indecent enough to stay
with you when you tell me not to.</font>

506
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,200
<font color=#FFFF00>I will do it all.</font>

507
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,500
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if you do all that, I still can't.</font>

508
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:29,010
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the job of the special forces
to make the impossible possible.</font>

509
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Special forces.</font>

510
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,790
<font color=#FFFF00>So let me help with the barbershop, okay?</font>

511
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:38,930
<font color=#FFFF00>Because my father is responsible. Okay?</font>

512
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Please let me do it.</font>

513
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,950
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

514
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,120
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the same as what
happened three years ago.</font>

515
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:21,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if you scream,
people don't hear you out.</font>

516
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Something is different now.</font>

517
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:25,980
<font color=#FFFF00>What is?</font>

518
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,580
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not alone now.</font>

519
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,050
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, you're so cheesy now.</font>

520
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,360
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm about to have one more reason
why you shouldn't be...</font>

521
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,300
<font color=#FFFF00>I wasn't talking about me.</font>

522
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

523
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,760
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew you'd do promotions
at this elementary level.</font>

524
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you dare tell people
you work at Silent Monster!</font>

526
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:13,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Agreed. You have a lot to learn.</font>

527
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,860
<font color=#FFFF00>Who said you could quit?</font>

528
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:16,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo Hee.</font>

529
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,560
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've called me about this.</font>

530
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:23,170
<font color=#FFFF00>We all came to help, Ro Woon.</font>

531
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,370

00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:45,620
<font color=#FFFF00><i>As you already know,

535
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,780
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Then what?</i></font>

536
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,530
<font color=#FFFF00><i>Rather than complaining about
the changes of the world...</i></font>

537
00:53:56,530 --> 00:54:00,170
<font color=#FFFF00><i>it's easier, faster, and
more effective to change myself.</i></font>

538
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,700
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you like red ginseng?</font>

539
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,140
<font color=#FFFF00>Take one.</font>

540
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:11,890
<font color=#FFFF00>And then can you fill out this survey?</font>

541
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:13,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, could you fill out this survey?</font>

542
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,470
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

543
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:18,750
<font color=#FFFF00>- Take this red ginseng.
- Can you take this survey?</font>

544
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Feel free to answer the questions.</font>

545
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:23,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Take this red ginseng as a reward.</font>

546
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Take one survey sheet.</font>

547
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,020
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yoo Hee, you take one, too.
- One for me?</font>

548
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:36,560
<font color=#FFFF00><i>We have do thorough market
research first for renovation.</i></font>

549
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,110
<font color=#FFFF00>You look like an actor.</font>

550
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:16,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Wow, you look cool.</font>

551
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:19,980
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks good on you.
It makes you look 10 years younger.</font>

552
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:26,070
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you my dad?</font>

553
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:29,300
<font color=#FFFF00>You look cool. You look so different.</font>

554
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you replace
the towels altogether?</font>

555
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,740
<font color=#FFFF00>To match the theme of the interior
and even the sign outside.</font>

556
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,170
<font color=#FFFF00>You can also change the name
of the shop to match the theme.</font>

557
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:42,030
<font color=#FFFF00>It would be nice to change
the floor, ceiling, and wall this way.</font>

558
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:47,760
<font color=#FFFF00>I... don't know how to
thank you for all this.</font>

559
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:53,940
<font color=#FFFF00>But I'm uncomfortable
with this whole idea.</font>

560
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,120
<font color=#FFFF00>Change is the only way to survive.</font>

561
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,140
<font color=#FFFF00>If I want to change everything</font>

562
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,190
<font color=#FFFF00>what's the point of
staying at that location?</font>

563
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:07,370
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry that you
put a lot of work into this.</font>

564
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:09,300
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's okay.
- Not at all.</font>

565
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,220
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're entitled to feel that way.
- Not at all, sir.</font>

566
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,430
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad...</font>

567
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:35,490
<font color=#FFFF00>Then... I will go home first.</font>

568
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,530
<font color=#FFFF00>Please get home safely.</font>

569
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:47,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Why doesn't he want to
come out of his comfort zone?</font>

570
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:52,350
<font color=#FFFF00>It was our fault for pushing him to
change without asking him first.</font>

571
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:55,620
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to find a way to get through
to him that won't change him.</font>

572
00:56:58,330 --> 00:56:59,980
<font color=#FFFF00>Does such a thing exist?</font>

573
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:03,730
<font color=#FFFF00>I only heard someone say that.</font>

574
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,860
<font color=#FFFF00>There has to be a way of

576
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't try to change.</font>

577
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:26,020
<font color=#FFFF00>I will find a way, so don't worry.</font>

578
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Go home.</font>

579
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:31,140

- Go ahead.</font>

581
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,950
<font color=#FFFF00>Please do me this favor.</font>

582
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:58,400
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a very famous anchor...</font>

583
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,990
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't guarantee if he'll do it or not.</font>

584
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:04,250
<font color=#FFFF00>- You know that, right?
- Sure. Thank you.</font>

585
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,550
<font color=#FFFF00>Just ask him to take
a look at the proposal.</font>

587
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,390
<font color=#FFFF00>In return, I also have
a favor to ask of you.</font>

588
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:15,220
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you pretend to be
my boyfriend just once?</font>

589
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,740
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

590
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,960
<font color=#FFFF00>You know he's my first crush
from my church, right?</font>

591
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,940
<font color=#FFFF00>I was a kid at that time who wore braces.</font>

592
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,100
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to show him
that I'm totally different now.</font>

593
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,330
<font color=#FFFF00>Of all people, why me?</font>

594
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:32,030
<font color=#FFFF00>I played a rude bride-to-be
in front of your father.</font>

595
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:34,300
<font color=#FFFF00>You can put on a show for me, can't you?</font>

596
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:38,430
<font color=#FFFF00>- I still find it hard to do...
- Ah, you don't want to?</font>

597
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:46,260
<font color=#FFFF00>When did I say I didn't want to?</font>

598
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's do it.</font>

599
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,480
<font color=#FFFF00>You will do it then, right?</font>

600
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,410
<font color=#FFFF00>I like the idea.</font>

601
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:05,520
<font color=#FFFF00>I can just say hi and leave, right?</font>

602
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,100
<font color=#FFFF00>- Correct. Kiss me before you leave.
- Okay... what?</font>

603
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,750
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest, I also have
a painful past involving him.</font>

604
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,550
<font color=#FFFF00>He was sort of seeing me</font>

605
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:18,590
<font color=#FFFF00>and I ended up witnessing
him kiss my best friend.</font>

606
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:20,890
<font color=#FFFF00>I want my trauma treated.</font>

607
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,520
<font color=#FFFF00>But still, a kiss isn't right...</font>

608
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,380
<font color=#FFFF00>Just a light kiss to say bye.
Can't you do that much?</font>

609
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,600
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't do it.</font>

610
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:35,090
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I can't do it either.</font>

611
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:44,480
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. Then I will kiss you on the cheek.</font>

612
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,960
<font color=#FFFF00>- On my lips.
- On your cheek.</font>

613
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:50,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine. On the cheek.</font>

614
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:51,990
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go in.</font>

615
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,120
<font color=#FFFF00>The cheek, okay?</font>

616
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:07,720
<font color=#FFFF00>- Suk Joon, long time no see.
- Hi, Yeon Jung. How have you been?</font>

617
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,130
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is he?</font>

618
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:12,140
<font color=#FFFF00>This is CEO Eun Hwan Ki
of Silent Monster.</font>

619
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,730
<font color=#FFFF00>He's my boyfriend.</font>

620
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,680
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh, hello.
- Nice to meet you.</font>

621
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:28,100
<font color=#FFFF00>- He wanted to say hi.
- I see.</font>

622
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:32,310
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, you can go now.</font>

623
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,960
<font color=#FFFF00>Go? Now?</font>

624
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:00,350
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks. See you.</font>

625
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,530
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're all set.
- Thank you.</font>

626
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:54,410

630
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:17,800
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, Yeon Jung.</font>

631
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank Hwan Ki instead.</font>

632
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,400
<font color=#FFFF00>I only introduced them.</font>

633
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:25,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Most of all, I liked the idea.</font>

634
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:27,200
<font color=#FFFF00>The production crew liked it, too.</font>

635
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:33,730
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm leaving for America tonight.</font>

636
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:34,870
<font color=#FFFF00>What? America?</font>

637
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:36,790
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be gone for a while, this time.</font>

638
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:39,260
<font color=#FFFF00>But don't be too happy about that.</font>

639
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:41,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Why so suddenly?</font>

640
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,020
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I suppose I'll
linger in his thoughts?</font>

641
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,650
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't told Hwan Ki that I'm leaving.</font>

642
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:52,230
<font color=#FFFF00>I was hoping that I'd
linger painfully in his mind.</font>

643
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:55,000
<font color=#FFFF00>But you still need to say goodbye...</font>

644
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,370
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, we kind of said goodbye.</font>

645
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,400
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take care of him.</font>

646

647
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,140
<font color=#FFFF00>I know, but I'm asking you.</font>

648
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,170
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a safe flight, Yeon Jung.</font>

649
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:34,090
