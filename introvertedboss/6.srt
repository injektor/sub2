157
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,040
<font color="yellow">You pathetic idiot!</font>

158
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,870
<font color="yellow">Father, the thing is...</font>

159
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,230
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

160
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,230
<font color="yellow">Please stop it.</font>

161
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,600
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

162
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,070
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- My goodness.</font>

163
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,000
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

164
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,500
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

165
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,570
<font color="yellow">Why are you Eun Hwan Gi, not Kang Woo Il?</font>

166
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,670
<font color="yellow">I placed Woo Il right next to you...</font>

167
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,600
<font color="yellow">so that you'd speak like him,</font>

168
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,200
<font color="yellow">think like him,</font>

169
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,700
<font color="yellow">eat like him, and breathe like him!</font>

170
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,030
<font color="yellow">Be at least as good as a pore on his foot.</font>

171
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,930
<font color="yellow">Be like Kang Woo Il, for goodness' sake!</font>

172
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,570
<font color="yellow">Please... Please stop.</font>

173
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,200
<font color="yellow">Don't do this. Please don't.</font>

174
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,970
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

175
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,970
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

176
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,000
<font color="yellow">How could he be my son?</font>

177
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,030
<font color="yellow">What did I do to get a son like him?</font>

178
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,970
<font color="yellow">Trace the IP address of the scum...</font>

179
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,170
<font color="yellow">who made that video clip go viral.</font>

180
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,100
<font color="yellow">As it's an anonymous forum, the user information is encrypted.</font>

181
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,900
<font color="yellow">It's impossible to trace the address.</font>

182
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,730
<font color="yellow">Then fire the person who was at the...</font>

183
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,430
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,030
<font color="yellow">Fire the whole staff!</font>

185
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,170
<font color="yellow">Silent Monster is only starting to settle down.</font>

186
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,930
<font color="yellow">A rash change in personnel might cause...</font>

187
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,830
<font color="yellow">You should first calm down and...</font>

188
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,400
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Sir.</font>

189
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,130
<font color="yellow">It's the third time.</font>

190
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,630
<font color="yellow">I sincerely apologize.</font>

191
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,330
<font color="yellow">It's for something I did.</font>

192
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,570
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

193
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,900
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

194
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,990
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

195
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,090
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

196
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,260
<font color="yellow">You're in there, right?</font>

197
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,190
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

198
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,490
<font color="yellow">Please open the door.</font>

199
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,590
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

200
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,390
<font color="yellow">Please open the door.</font>

201
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,190
<font color="yellow">Open up.</font>

202
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,590
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

203
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,460
<font color="yellow">Open the door.</font>

204
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,860
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- There you go.</font>

205
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
<font color="yellow">Just a second. Excuse me.</font>

206
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,520
<font color="yellow">Well, Boss.</font>

207
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,560
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

208
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,790
<font color="yellow">It's something important. Boss.</font>

209
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,660
<font color="yellow">Can you look at me, Boss?</font>

210
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,820
<font color="yellow">Boss? Boss?</font>

211
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,190
<font color="yellow">Boss, look at me.</font>

212
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,390
<font color="yellow">This won't do.</font>

213
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,520
<font color="yellow">Boss, then I'm going to come over there.</font>

214
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,590
<font color="yellow">Okay? Hold on. Here I go.</font>

215
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,260
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

216
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,220
<font color="yellow">What are you...</font>

217
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,130
<font color="yellow">I was in a rush.</font>

218
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,760
<font color="yellow">- About Mr. Kang...
- I said, stop it!</font>

219
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,420
<font color="yellow">I'm... I'm sorry.</font>

220
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,290
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

221
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,690
<font color="yellow">I thought you didn't have anyone above you,</font>

222
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,660
<font color="yellow">but you were feeling inferior to your friend.</font>

223
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,420
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? It's not like that.</font>

224
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,490
<font color="yellow">It's the presentation he did that became a legend.</font>

225
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,420
<font color="yellow">It's actually your work, isn't it?</font>

226
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,590
<font color="yellow">The key idea is to know your target.</font>

227
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,060
<font color="yellow">It's all in this picture.</font>

228
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,560
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

229
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,190
<font color="yellow">The audience we have to gather is 160,000.</font>

230
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,390
<font color="yellow">If we invite 20 people per company,</font>

231
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,660
<font color="yellow">we can assume about 10 people will make it.</font>

232
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,720
<font color="yellow">That means we should tell at least 500,000 people.</font>

233
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,590
<font color="yellow">He made the ramyeon presentation last time, too.</font>

234
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,490
<font color="yellow">He must have been working alone in the back.</font>

235
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,890
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you say so?</font>

236
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,260
<font color="yellow">You should boast around.</font>

237
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,160
<font color="yellow">At the least, you could scream like you did just now.</font>

238
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,260
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, people won't know.</font>

239
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,290
<font color="yellow">Tell us what you're thinking...</font>

240
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,960
<font color="yellow">while watching us from behind.</font>

241
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,660
<font color="yellow">Why is she doing this to me?</font>

242
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,020
<font color="yellow">I don't think you're a bad man.</font>

243
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,960
<font color="yellow">You just look hurt.</font>

244
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,990
<font color="yellow">Hey. What is this smell?</font>

245
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,720
<font color="yellow">Is it peppermint candy?</font>

246
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,290
<font color="yellow">Peppermint candy? No.</font>

247
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,690
<font color="yellow">It is. It's peppermint candy.</font>

248
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,790
<font color="yellow">It's not peppermint candy.</font>

249
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,420
<font color="yellow">It's mint.</font>

250
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,090
<font color="yellow">I was right. You came to the bar that time.</font>

251
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,960
<font color="yellow">I remembered correctly.</font>

252
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,220
<font color="yellow">Am I right?</font>

253
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,160
<font color="yellow">Did you drive me home? Am I right?</font>

254
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,130
<font color="yellow">Why are you running away?</font>

255
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,090
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

256
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,720
<font color="yellow">What? Why are you embarrassed?</font>

257
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,720
<font color="yellow">Did anything else happen other than getting us cabs?</font>

258
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,090
<font color="yellow">The founder of the agency requested Silent Monster to disband,</font>

259
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,920
<font color="yellow">but I was able to get it postponed.</font>

260
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,520
<font color="yellow">However, there is a condition.</font>

261
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,920
<font color="yellow">You must transform Eun Hwan Gi.</font>

262
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,260
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

263
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,590
<font color="yellow">You will become king makers.</font>

264
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,190
<font color="yellow">You have to turn Mr. Eun into an ideal leader.</font>

265
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,860
<font color="yellow">Us?</font>

266
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,490
<font color="yellow">An ideal leader? That means he has to become someone like you.</font>

267
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,990
<font color="yellow">- How is that possible?
- How can people change?</font>

268
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,920
<font color="yellow">Are there detailed missions we must accomplish?</font>

269
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,060
<font color="yellow">Let's start with a presentation for food delivery application.</font>

270
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,920
<font color="yellow">It's a small project, so it'll be a warm-up.</font>

271
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,720
<font color="yellow">Does this mean we have to put Mr. Eun at the podium again?</font>

272
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,790
<font color="yellow">It'll be easier to find a new job.</font>

273
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,520
<font color="yellow">Will anyone take you?</font>

274
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,590
<font color="yellow">I feel like your words are sharp.</font>

275
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,320
<font color="yellow">- Of course they are.
- What?</font>

276
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,420
<font color="yellow">Do you have anywhere to go?</font>

277
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,920
<font color="yellow">- What do we do?
- Where?</font>

278
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,490
<font color="yellow">It was me who pushed Boss to present.</font>

279
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,890
<font color="yellow">Everyone might get fired because of me.</font>

280
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,660
<font color="yellow">All right. At times like these, you must take it easy.</font>

281
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,160
<font color="yellow">What you need at Silent Monster is teamwork.</font>

282
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,790
<font color="yellow">Let us go on a trip as a workshop.</font>

283
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,160
<font color="yellow">A workshop?</font>

284
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,990
<font color="yellow">Do I have to pick up after him on the weekend?</font>

285
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,820
<font color="yellow">I just signed myself up for English classes.</font>

286
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,420
<font color="yellow">I need to build up my experiences to find myself a new job.</font>

287
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,060
<font color="yellow">It's been years since our family went on a trip together.</font>

288
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,160
<font color="yellow">Why did it have to be this week? Gosh, it's hot.</font>

289
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,490
<font color="yellow">I have to get groceries then prepare the games.</font>

290
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,760
<font color="yellow">It's all going to be on me.</font>

291
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,660
<font color="yellow">I'm going on a trip with Ro Woon.</font>

292
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,090
<font color="yellow">I'm not going.</font>

293
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,060
<font color="yellow">Does he think we want to go?</font>

294
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,820
<font color="yellow">Yes. He says he won't go.</font>

295
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,490
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Yes, Sir.</font>

296
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,860
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang says he will come with us.</font>

297
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,490
<font color="yellow">That will work.</font>

298
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,760
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Okay.</font>

299
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,060
<font color="yellow">Sir. We'll get going.</font>

300
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,690
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

301
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,790
<font color="yellow">What if we come back and all of our desks are gone?</font>

302
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,720
<font color="yellow">He has no intention to change.</font>

303
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,490
<font color="yellow">Consider it our farewell trip before we get fired.</font>

304
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,360
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang says he will come with us.</font>

305
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,920
<font color="yellow">- What about your staff?
- I'll protect my own staff.</font>

306
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,320
<font color="yellow">How will you protect them?</font>

307
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,360
<font color="yellow">Just by watching,</font>

308
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,020
<font color="yellow">you can't protect anyone.</font>

309
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,720
<font color="yellow">Will I be able to change?</font>

310
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,490
<font color="yellow">All I can think about is barbecue.</font>

311
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,490
<font color="yellow">- Let's eat a lot of good food.
- Let's go on a trip</font>

312
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,990
<font color="yellow">- I'll prepare it first.
- Let's go</font>

313
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,560
<font color="yellow">I love barbecues...</font>

314
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,190
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What is it?</font>

315
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,920
<font color="yellow">I suddenly got a chill. It must be the weather, right?</font>

316
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,020
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into him?</font>

317
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,760
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

318
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,090
<font color="yellow">Go, go.</font>

319
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,020
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming.</font>

320
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,790
<font color="yellow">It's been three years since we went on a trip together.</font>

321
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,420
<font color="yellow">All right, gather around!</font>

322
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,560
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

323
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,960
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

324
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,720
<font color="yellow">Okay, now greet your opponents.</font>

325
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,360
<font color="yellow">- I look forward to it.
- Let's play fair.</font>

326
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,190
<font color="yellow">I've had some experience on stage. To stand in front of others,</font>

327
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,490
<font color="yellow">you need to relax your body not just your mouth.</font>

328
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,720
<font color="yellow">That's true. Body language is important during presentations.</font>

329
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,520
<font color="yellow">That's why I prepared this game.</font>

330
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,760
<font color="yellow">"Talk with Your Body".</font>

331
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,490
<font color="yellow">All right, get ready.</font>

332
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,520
<font color="yellow">(BASKETBALL)</font>

333
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,560
<font color="yellow">This is too easy.</font>

334
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,760
<font color="yellow">- Basketball.
- Okay.</font>

335
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,890
<font color="yellow">Correct.</font>

336
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
<font color="yellow">- Bowling.
- You can't do that.</font>

337
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,090
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
- That's correct.</font>

338
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,490
<font color="yellow">Correct.</font>

339
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,120
<font color="yellow">This one will be hard.</font>

340
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:54,060
<font color="yellow">They won't get this. Don't worry, they won't get it.</font>

341
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,560
<font color="yellow">- What is that?
- Yes, this is hard.</font>

342
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,220
<font color="yellow">- Hurry, hurry.
- Thumbs up?</font>

343
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,120
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

344
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,720
<font color="yellow">- Swings. Swings.
- Yes.</font>

345
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,920
<font color="yellow">Swings.</font>

346
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,790
<font color="yellow">- What is that?
- Levitation?</font>

347
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,920
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

348
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,960
<font color="yellow">- A trapeze!
- Okay, you got it!</font>

349
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,720
<font color="yellow">A dinosaur.</font>

350
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,520
<font color="yellow">Tyrannosaurus?</font>

351
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,760
<font color="yellow">An anteater.</font>

352
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,990
<font color="yellow">He's amazing.</font>

353
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,060
<font color="yellow">- Was he in musicals before?
- A camel.</font>

354
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,290
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

355
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,160
<font color="yellow">- A camel.
- He was born to do this.</font>

356
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,060
<font color="yellow">- Why did you tell them?
- He looks like one.</font>

357
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,960
<font color="yellow">- Last one.
- What is it?</font>

358
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,960
<font color="yellow">What is it, Mr. Kang? Hurry. Hurry.</font>

359
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,860
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

360
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,520
<font color="yellow">I know! Back hug!</font>

361
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,020
<font color="yellow">Correct!</font>

362
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,020
<font color="yellow">We got all of them.</font>

363
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,990
<font color="yellow">We answered them all.</font>

364
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,090
<font color="yellow">- We got it all, right?
- Yes, you did.</font>

365
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,220
<font color="yellow">Next is Mr. Eun's team.</font>

366
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,720
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's already up.</font>

367
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,520
<font color="yellow">Please go on.</font>

368
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,990
<font color="yellow">- Let us start.
- We can do it.</font>

369
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,290
<font color="yellow">Boss, you can be like Mr. Kang, too.</font>

370
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,620
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

371
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,490
<font color="yellow">You can do it. Go.</font>

372
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,160
<font color="yellow">You can do it.</font>

373
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,960
<font color="yellow">Yes. If I don't have to speak, I might be able to do it.</font>

374
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,490
<font color="yellow">Let's try it.</font>

375
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,120
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

376
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,720
<font color="yellow">Okay, get ready.</font>

377
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,390
<font color="yellow">Good luck!</font>

378
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,490
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- You can do it.</font>

379
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,690
<font color="yellow">Start.</font>

380
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,390
<font color="yellow">An eagle?</font>

381
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,320
<font color="yellow">It is the king of the sky.</font>

382
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,090
<font color="yellow">Those birds can intimidate others with their piercing eyes alone.</font>

383
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,720
<font color="yellow">- A superhuman.
- Laser beams.</font>

384
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,560
<font color="yellow">And they have majestic wings.</font>

385
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,620
<font color="yellow">The way they fly is characterized by a sense of unmatchable grandeur.</font>

386
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,290
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to provoke me?</font>

387
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,990
<font color="yellow">What's he trying to tell us? I'm so frustrated.</font>

388
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,120
<font color="yellow">Please make your gestures bigger.</font>

389
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,820
<font color="yellow">If I imitate their piercing eyes...</font>

390
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,760
<font color="yellow">and the majestic way they fly,</font>

391
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,060
<font color="yellow">they'd be able to guess the answer easily.</font>

392
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,090
<font color="yellow">Open your heart. Just get it all out.</font>

393
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,320
<font color="yellow">- Time is up.
- Stop doing...</font>

394
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,320
<font color="yellow">Time is up. We have to move on.</font>

395
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,190
<font color="yellow">- What's the answer?
- It was "eagle".</font>

396
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,820
<font color="yellow">- That's too bad.
- The answer was "eagle".</font>

397
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,060
<font color="yellow">Eagles fly like this.</font>

398
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,960
<font color="yellow">- We don't have time.
- Why can't you do this?</font>

399
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,820
<font color="yellow">- We need to move on. Next question.
- Gosh, my back hurts.</font>

400
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,290
<font color="yellow">This one will be difficult.</font>

401
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,720
<font color="yellow">Like Mr. Kang,</font>

402
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,120
<font color="yellow">try to do it in an accurate, simple way. Go ahead, Boss.</font>

403
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,920
<font color="yellow">- You can do it.
- Good luck!</font>

404
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,460
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Hatch out of your shell.</font>

405
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
<font color="yellow">Start.</font>

406
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,990
<font color="yellow">For the last one, I wasted too much time on thinking.</font>

407
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,190
<font color="yellow">I must decide quickly this time.</font>

408
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,560
<font color="yellow">Popcorn is inanimate, so I should try to look into its inner world.</font>

409
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,520
<font color="yellow">Popcorn, popcorn, popcorn.</font>

410
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,790
<font color="yellow">It's crouching like this inside its hard shell.</font>

411
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,290
<font color="yellow">When it's heated, it reveals its white flesh as if it's blossoming.</font>

412
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,220
<font color="yellow">This is it. The inner world of popcorn.</font>

413
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
<font color="yellow">I should express such passion of popcorn...</font>

414
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,890
<font color="yellow">using my entire body.</font>

415
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,790
<font color="yellow">- A tadpole?
- A missile?</font>

416
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,220
<font color="yellow">Oh, fireworks. It burst like this.</font>

417
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
<font color="yellow">Rage.</font>

418
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
<font color="yellow">Vomiting?</font>

419
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,360
<font color="yellow">"Planet of the Apes".</font>

420
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,820
<font color="yellow">Time is up! You failed again.</font>

421
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,820
<font color="yellow">You used up your time. This was an epic fail!</font>

422
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
<font color="yellow">- What was the answer?
- It was "popcorn".</font>

423
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,160
<font color="yellow">You should've done this to express popcorn. Why does popcorn...</font>

424
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,590
<font color="yellow">- Why didn't you do this?
- Did it burn or something?</font>

425
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,960
<font color="yellow">- Was it too difficult?
- It burned.</font>

426
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,160
<font color="yellow">- You make it too difficult.
- It's too difficult.</font>

427
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,590
<font color="yellow">- Is it that hard?
- Popcorn. A grain of corn pops.</font>

428
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,620
<font color="yellow">- Like this.
- That was close.</font>

429
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,560
<font color="yellow">You did well, though.</font>

430
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,120
<font color="yellow">- Cheers!
- Cheers!</font>

431
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,120
<font color="yellow">- Thank you, Mr. Kang.
- Thank you!</font>

432
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,320
<font color="yellow">No problem. Eat up.</font>

433
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,190
<font color="yellow">- This is so nice.
- Seriously.</font>

434
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,960
<font color="yellow">We're surrounded by the ocean and mountains.</font>

435
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,260
<font color="yellow">- I can't stop drinking.
- I love being near the ocean.</font>

436
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,620
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it so beautiful?
- Yes, it's so nice here.</font>

437
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,460
<font color="yellow">- I'll do it.
- Pour me a drink.</font>

438
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,120
<font color="yellow">All right, then. I'll leave it in your hands.</font>

439
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,560
<font color="yellow">We're surrounded by the mountains. Look.</font>

440
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,920
<font color="yellow">- It looks like the Garden of Eden.
- Shall we have beer?</font>

441
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,190
<font color="yellow">- Yes. Please make a toast.
- Thank you.</font>

442
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,220
<font color="yellow">Please make a toast.</font>

443
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,160
<font color="yellow">Here's to the teamwork of Silent Monster!</font>

444
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,290
<font color="yellow">- Cheers!
- Cheers!</font>

445
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,960
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be greedy and think that I can change overnight.</font>

446
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,460
<font color="yellow">I should start step by step with the little things that I can do.</font>

447
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,920
<font color="yellow">I'll win their hearts and thank them for their hard work with this meat.</font>

448
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,760
<font color="yellow">- He's preparing the barbecue.
- I see.</font>

449
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,790
<font color="yellow">The second they put the perfectly grilled meat into their mouths,</font>

450
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,990
<font color="yellow">the juice from the meat will explode...</font>

451
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,060
<font color="yellow">and help them forget about their stress and fatigue.</font>

452
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,490
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it pretty?
- I love talking about this stuff.</font>

453
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,790
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so happy right now.</font>

454
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,520
<font color="yellow">- The barbecue is ready!
- Mr. Eun brought us the meat.</font>

455
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,390
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

456
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,160
<font color="yellow">It looks amazing.</font>

457
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,990
<font color="yellow">- Please try it.
- You're the best.</font>

458
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,620
<font color="yellow">Mr. Eun, I didn't know that you had a side like this.</font>

459
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,390
<font color="yellow">- It's seriously so good.
- I'm glad you like it.</font>

460
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,260
<font color="yellow">- It's so juicy.
- Really?</font>

461
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,460
<font color="yellow">Mr. Eun, we love you.</font>

462
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,520
<font color="yellow">- Eun Hwan Gi! Eun Hwan Gi!
- Gosh, stop.</font>

463
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,260
<font color="yellow">- I want to give this to you. Here.
- Don't worry. I'm okay.</font>

464
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,460
<font color="yellow">- I've already eaten a lot.
- Come on. Please eat this.</font>

465
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,090
<font color="yellow">- Why are you all being like this?
- I'll fan you.</font>

466
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,520
<font color="yellow">All right, everyone. Here's to Silent Monster's amazing future!</font>

467
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,720
<font color="yellow">- Cheers!
- Cheers!</font>

468
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,660
<font color="yellow">It's so delicious.</font>

469
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,620
<font color="yellow">- I know. It's really good.
- Why didn't you go there?</font>

470
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,090
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it so nice here?
- Oh, my.</font>

471
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,520
<font color="yellow">- It is.
- I'm so glad we came here.</font>

472
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,260
<font color="yellow">- Yes, totally.
- It is really nice here.</font>

473
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,960
<font color="yellow">Who brought this kimchi?</font>

474
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,760
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

475
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,760
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. It was in the refrigerator.</font>

476
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,520
<font color="yellow">I made the kimchi.</font>

477
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,690
<font color="yellow">It's my kimchi. I made it.</font>

478
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,560
<font color="yellow">I made the kimchi. I made it myself.</font>

479
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,160
<font color="yellow">Here, try it.</font>

480
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,690
<font color="yellow">I don't eat kimchi.</font>

481
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,490
<font color="yellow">I don't like it.</font>

482
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,360
<font color="yellow">Are we getting more meat?</font>

483
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,190
<font color="yellow">It'll be ready soon.</font>

484
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,020
<font color="yellow">Boss must be hungry, too.</font>

485
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,490
<font color="yellow">Just eat this.</font>

486
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
<font color="yellow">Mr. Eun.</font>

487
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,920
<font color="yellow">Mr. Eun.</font>

488
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,490
<font color="yellow">Mr. Eun, hand over the baton to me.</font>

489
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,860
<font color="yellow">You should go eat.</font>

490
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,260
<font color="yellow">- It's okay. I'll do it.
- Don't worry. I'll do it.</font>

491
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,320
<font color="yellow">- All right. I should do this.
- That's...</font>

492
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,860
<font color="yellow">You're making the juice in the meat seep out.</font>

493
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,660
<font color="yellow">That juice must be more important than teamwork.</font>

494
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,060
<font color="yellow">He loves to embarrass us, which is incredibly off-putting.</font>

495
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,760
<font color="yellow">I'll pack up as soon as I get back.</font>

<font color="yellow">Se Jong, what's all this?</font>

499
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,890
<font color="yellow">I want to surprise Ro Woon with a special event.</font>

500
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,920
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you and Ro Woon were close like that.</font>

501
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,260
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to make our relationship develop in that direction.</font>

502
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,090
<font color="yellow">I want to get it done as soon as possible. Can you give me a hand?</font>

503
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,860
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

504
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,120
<font color="yellow">Just so you know, girls don't like such events.</font>

505
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,920
<font color="yellow">Expensive gifts won't work on her...</font>

506
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,220
<font color="yellow">because she's so impractical.</font>

507
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,260
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if childish stuff like this would work.</font>

508
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,690
<font color="yellow">What if she rejects you?</font>

509
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,520
<font color="yellow">It'll happen in front of all of us.</font>

510
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,320
<font color="yellow">Well, I guess I'll be known as a complete loser.</font>

511
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,160
<font color="yellow">I don't care. I don't have time to worry about what others think.</font>

512
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,390
<font color="yellow">I'm busy enough trying to win Ro Woon's heart.</font>

513
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,790
<font color="yellow">You must like her a lot.</font>

514
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,960
<font color="yellow">Ro Woon is the only one who doesn't see that.</font>

515
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,760
<font color="yellow">I really hope she gets touched by this event.</font>

516
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,760
<font color="yellow">It will be very touching. If it were me...</font>

517
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,120
<font color="yellow">Hold this for me, please.</font>

518
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,220
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

519
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,690
<font color="yellow">We can get this done quickly if we gather our strengths.</font>

520
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,760
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Will it look good here?</font>

521
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,760
<font color="yellow">Shall we put it there?</font>

522
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,260
<font color="yellow">I'll help you.</font>

523
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,160
<font color="yellow">I can do it by myself. Just get some rest.</font>

524
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,530
<font color="yellow">Why do I keep seeing them together?</font>

525
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,890
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to tell me?</font>

526
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,360
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

<font color="yellow">for him to change.</font>

534
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,290
<font color="yellow">That didn't work.</font>

<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

536
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,590
<font color="yellow">It sounds like your attitude has changed.</font>

537
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,760
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

538
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,290
<font color="yellow">No, it's just...</font>

539
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,220
<font color="yellow">It's not really for him.</font>

540
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,990
<font color="yellow">It's for other people.</font>

541
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,760

00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,760
<font color="yellow">Being misunderstood is surely distressing,</font>

548
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,490
<font color="yellow">but being on the other side...</font>

549
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,690
<font color="yellow">is equally distressing and uncomfortable.</font>

550
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,820
<font color="yellow">Boss probably doesn't mean to come across like that.</font>

551
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,990
<font color="yellow">It worked.</font>

552
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,160
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

553
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,990
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,790
<font color="yellow">Hey, what are you doing hiding there?</font>

558
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,320
<font color="yellow">I wasn't hiding.</font>

559
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,360
<font color="yellow">Try to get close to the team members.</font>

560
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,960
<font color="yellow">Don't be such a loner even here.</font>

<font color="yellow">You're here for Silent Monster, too.</font>

- What?</font>

564
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,620
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to say?</font>

565
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,960
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,860
<font color="yellow">get fired.</font>

575

<font color="yellow">I miss the kids so much!</font>

576
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,160
<font color="yellow">I miss them!</font>

577
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,760
<font color="yellow">I need an employee,</font>

578
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,220
<font color="yellow">not a mom.</font>

579
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,360
<font color="yellow">Well, I have to go.</font>

580
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,060

<font color="yellow">but it's uncomfortable and difficult...</font>

584
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,490
<font color="yellow">for those who misunderstand him, too.</font>

585
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,060
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

586
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,690
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

587
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,720
<font color="yellow">You must have felt embarrassed earlier.</font>

588
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,760
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

589
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,690
<font color="yellow">I felt...</font>

590
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,590
<font color="yellow">it'd be a shame if you only...</font>

591
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,820
<font color="yellow">played the role of a mom.</font>

592
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,590
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

593
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,390
<font color="yellow">You need an employee, not a mom.</font>

594
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,090
<font color="yellow">A careless and irresponsible mom...</font>

595
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,860
<font color="yellow">put you in trouble.</font>

596
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,490
<font color="yellow">Your being a mom is not the problem.</font>

597
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,720
<font color="yellow">The real problem is...</font>

598
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,960
<font color="yellow">that you think of being a mom...</font>

599
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,360
<font color="yellow">as a weakness.</font>

600
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,290
<font color="yellow">These taste great.</font>

601
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,690
<font color="yellow">As I'm just a mom, I should treat the others to food.</font>

602
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,490
<font color="yellow">As I'm just a married woman, I should leverage my friendliness...</font>

603
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,490
<font color="yellow">rather than my capabilities.</font>

604
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,490
<font color="yellow">I'm sure there are things you can do well because you're a mom.</font>

605
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,890
<font color="yellow">Don't deny yourself.</font>

606
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,290
<font color="yellow">Protect it.</font>

607
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,620
<font color="yellow">That's the kind of employee I need.</font>

608
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,620
<font color="yellow">Mr. Eun, I didn't know you were thinking that way.</font>

609
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,760
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

610
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,920
<font color="yellow">Can I tell you something?</font>

611
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,760
<font color="yellow">You don't have to give presentations.</font>

612
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,190
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

613
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,160
<font color="yellow">You don't have to stand in the front just because you're a leader.</font>

614
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,290
<font color="yellow">Let someone who's good at it do it.</font>

615
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,560
<font color="yellow">Although you might not be satisfied,</font>

616
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,390
<font color="yellow">we're...</font>

617
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,590
<font color="yellow">on the same boat now.</font>

618
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,620
<font color="yellow">These are quite heavy.</font>

619
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,460
<font color="yellow">I think Ro Woon will do a good job.</font>

620
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,960
<font color="yellow">Why don't you let her do it?</font>

621
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,530
<font color="yellow">Ms. Chae?</font>

622
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,260
<font color="yellow">It seems like she's the one you like the most among us.</font>

623
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,920
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

624
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,860
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

625
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,190
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

626
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,420
<font color="yellow">I can sense it because I'm a mom.</font>

627
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,420
<font color="yellow">Do I have feelings for her?</font>

628
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,120
<font color="yellow">Do I even deserve to?</font>

629
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,160
<font color="yellow">Did I fail to hide my feelings?</font>

630
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,920
<font color="yellow">Did I even let others see it?</font>

631
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,120
<font color="yellow">That's impossible.</font>

632
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,960
<font color="yellow">I can hold back and hide feelings better than anyone.</font>

633
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,760
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

634
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,360
<font color="yellow">What are you up to?</font>

635
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,720
<font color="yellow">- Stop.
- Gosh.</font>

636
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,290
<font color="yellow">I'll cover your eyes from here.</font>

637
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,720
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

638
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,290
<font color="yellow">- I told you not to get cute.
- Hey.</font>

639
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,690
<font color="yellow">When a guy tries to surprise you, just play along...</font>

640
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,520
<font color="yellow">and pretend you're surprised. Is it that hard?</font>

641
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,590
<font color="yellow">- My goodness.
- Gosh.</font>

642
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,320
<font color="yellow">Wait. What's that?</font>

643
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,160
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

644
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:03,990
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

645
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,460
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I can hold back and hide...</font>

646
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,190
<font color="yellow">my feelings.</font>

647
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,520
<font color="yellow">Boss, do you love me?</font>

648
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,060
<font color="yellow">Why are you standing there?</font>

649
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,220
<font color="yellow">I just happened to press this,</font>

650
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,990
<font color="yellow">- and it suddenly...
- Why did you press it?</font>

651
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,620
<font color="yellow">Turn it off right now.</font>

652
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,320
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm sorry.</font>

653
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:36,160
<font color="yellow">No, don't press anything.</font>

654
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,060
<font color="yellow">Just get out of there.</font>

655
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,360
<font color="yellow">- No.
- That's so pretty.</font>

656
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,390
<font color="yellow">No. No!</font>

657
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,460
<font color="yellow">- No!
- It's amazing.</font>

658
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,490
<font color="yellow">It's beautiful.</font>

659
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:01,260
<font color="yellow">It is, but it's not supposed to start yet.</font>

660
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,260
<font color="yellow">This is not okay.</font>

661
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,320
<font color="yellow">It's beautiful.</font>

662
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,320
<font color="yellow">- Why did you do that?
- This is nice.</font>

663
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,390
<font color="yellow">Is he just going to run away after ruining my plan?</font>

664
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,420
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

665
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,860
<font color="yellow">No, I don't like her.</font>

666
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,860
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

667
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,760
<font color="yellow">Ta-da! It's stopped! It's over.</font>

668
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,220
<font color="yellow">- Ro Woon, I prepared this.
- All right.</font>

669
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:43,320
<font color="yellow">- Cheers. Thank you for today.
- Cheers. Thank you.</font>

670
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,560
<font color="yellow">- Cheers.
- Cheers.</font>

671
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,090
<font color="yellow">Yoo Hee, you went on many class trips back in college, right?</font>

672
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,360
<font color="yellow">Please sing a song you used to sing on class trips.</font>

673
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,220
<font color="yellow">I'm not a good singer.</font>

674
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,160
<font color="yellow">- Sing for us.
- Go, Yoo Hee.</font>

675
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,220
<font color="yellow">There are so many stars.</font>

676
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,060
<font color="yellow">- You're a good singer.
- The stars are falling on us.</font>

677
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,020
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my.
- You're amazing, Yoo Hee.</font>

678
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,890
<font color="yellow">- It's magnificent.
- Gosh.</font>

679
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,260
<font color="yellow">- Sun Bong.
- Sing another one.</font>

680
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,860
<font color="yellow">- I just...
- Sing another one.</font>

681
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,820
<font color="yellow">- worry about her.
- Sing another one.</font>

682
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,460
<font color="yellow">The fire is flaring up.</font>

683
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,220
<font color="yellow">- Se Jong, sing for us.
- I'm tone deaf.</font>

684
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,560
<font color="yellow">Then dance for us. You're a good dancer.</font>

685
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,120
<font color="yellow">If Gyo Ri sings, I'll dance to it.</font>

686
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,660
<font color="yellow">- I'm not a good singer.
- Come on.</font>

687
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,860
<font color="yellow">You look like a singer. Sing for us.</font>

688
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,620
<font color="yellow">- I'm really bad at singing.
- It's okay.</font>

689
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,390
<font color="yellow">I'll dance. Gyo Ri,</font>

690
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:50,520
<font color="yellow">please sing "Magic" by Secret.</font>

691
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,620
<font color="yellow">Yes, I like that song.</font>

692
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,960
<font color="yellow">- It's such an old one.
- Let's go in one beat</font>

693
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,920
<font color="yellow">Let's go in 2 beats, in 3 beats</font>

694
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,460
<font color="yellow">One, two, three, four</font>

695
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,220
<font color="yellow">My magic, magic, magic</font>

696
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,960
<font color="yellow">- My magic, magic, magic - You're a good dancer.</font>

697
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,960
<font color="yellow">You'll be surprised</font>

698
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,320
<font color="yellow">- My, my - You sing well too.</font>

699
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,660
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not very good.</font>

700
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,860
<font color="yellow">She isn't...</font>

701
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,490
<font color="yellow">here for revenge any longer.</font>

702
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,220
<font color="yellow">- I had fun today.
- Me too.</font>

703
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,690
<font color="yellow">It was more fun than I thought.</font>

704
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,020
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's good.</font>

705
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,090
<font color="yellow">I'm surprised Sun Bong said that he had fun.</font>

706
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:52,690
<font color="yellow">- I agree.
- I like having fun too.</font>

707
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,920
<font color="yellow">- What did you like the most?
- "Talk With Your Body".</font>

708
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,460
<font color="yellow">Ro Woon, what are you looking for?</font>

709
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,390
<font color="yellow">Have you seen my notebook?</font>

710
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,790
<font color="yellow">I can't let others see it.</font>

711
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,220
<font color="yellow">Why not? What's in it?</font>

712
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,990
<font color="yellow">She must have doodled the face of her crush.</font>

713
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,590
<font color="yellow">No, it's not like that.</font>

714
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:19,720
<font color="yellow">I sent your Christmas gift to the orphanage.</font>

715
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,460
<font color="yellow">I think I deserve a gift for doing a good deed.</font>

716
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,960
<font color="yellow">I just really like this.</font>

717
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,790
<font color="yellow">I'll go and see if I dropped it somewhere.</font>

718
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,490
<font color="yellow">Are you looking for this?</font>

719
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,320
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

720
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,120
<font color="yellow">- Let me look at it.
- Hey, give it back!</font>

721
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,920
<font color="yellow">- Who's in it?
- What are you doing?</font>

722
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,620
<font color="yellow">- Hold on.
- Don't be like that.</font>

723
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,060
<font color="yellow">- This is...
- What is it?</font>

724
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,820
<font color="yellow">- This is...
- It's...</font>

725
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:56,320
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- Wait.</font>

726
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,020
<font color="yellow">Who...</font>

727
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,320
<font color="yellow">is this?</font>

728
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,790
<font color="yellow">It's ugly. It has to be Se Jong.</font>

729
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,120
<font color="yellow">What? I hoped it would be me, but I'm not that ugly.</font>

730
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:10,920
<font color="yellow">No. This man has round eyes...</font>

731
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,820
<font color="yellow">that are long and lopsided.</font>

732
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,620
<font color="yellow">I think it's Mr. Eun.</font>

733
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,320
<font color="yellow">No way. The nose is too wide.</font>

734
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,360
<font color="yellow">Look at how wide it is. And the nostrils match Sun Bong.</font>

735
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:22,490
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about?
- This is definitely you.</font>

736
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:25,390
<font color="yellow">Ro Woon, who is this really?</font>

737
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,860
<font color="yellow">It's no one.</font>

738
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:09,020
<font color="yellow">He has a fiancee.</font>

739
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:13,720
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

740
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,290
<font color="yellow">Who do you mean?</font>

741
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,820
<font color="yellow">The man you drew.</font>

742
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,690
<font color="yellow">Who is it that I drew?</font>

743
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,860
<font color="yellow">You don't even know.</font>

744
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,460
<font color="yellow">Kang Woo Il.</font>

745
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,160
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

746
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,220
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

747
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,160
<font color="yellow">Just because I told you to become like him,</font>

748
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,820
<font color="yellow">it doesn't mean I like him as a man.</font>

749
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,860
<font color="yellow">No way. Never.</font>

750
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,590
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

751
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,260
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

752
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,020
<font color="yellow">does he really have one?</font>

753
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,460
<font color="yellow">Is he really getting married?</font>

754
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,220
<font color="yellow">Try...</font>

755
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,420
<font color="yellow">doing a presentation.</font>

756
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,490
<font color="yellow">Pardon? A presentation?</font>

757
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,590
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

758
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,320
<font color="yellow">I'll give you all the time you need.</font>

759
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,220
<font color="yellow">Let's...</font>

760
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,820
<font color="yellow">work together.</font>

761
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,620
<font color="yellow">Together?</font>

762
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,290
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

763
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,390
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

849
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,970
<font color="yellow">like asking someone out.</font>

850
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:47,730
<font color="yellow">You prepare grandiose, romantic words.</font>

<font color="yellow">You perfectly memorize them.</font>

852
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,770
<font color="yellow">You promise the person you'd get him even stars or the moon.</font>

853
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,830
<font color="yellow">Does it sound sincere?</font>

854
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,600
<font color="yellow">To attract the person's attention,</font>

855
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,900
<font color="yellow">you overdress yourself.</font>

856
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,930
<font color="yellow">How would it look?</font>

857
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:11,630
<font color="yellow">Predictions can always be wrong.</font>

860
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,670
<font color="yellow">don't have their phones with them?</font>

861
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:24,700
<font color="yellow">What if they have a phone phobia?</font>

862
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:29,670
<font color="yellow">Was that it?</font>

863
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:32,070
<font color="yellow">A phone phobia?</font>

864
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,730
<font color="yellow">It wasn't because you don't like delivery food?</font>

865
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:39,900
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't say I have a phobia. It just makes me...</font>

866
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,370
<font color="yellow">uncomfortable.</font>

867
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,630
<font color="yellow">In addition to having trouble looking people in the eye,</font>

868
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:51,400
<font color="yellow">you feel uncomfortable talking on the phone.</font>

869
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,130
<font color="yellow">And you're telling me how to ask someone out?</font>

870
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,070
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

871
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,600
<font color="yellow">How should you tell someone how you feel about him or her?</font>

872
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,100
<font color="yellow">I like you.</font>

873
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,900
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

874
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,830
<font color="yellow">That's what you should say.</font>

875
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:23,300
<font color="yellow">I mean,</font>

876
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,570
<font color="yellow">if you were asking someone out.</font>

877
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:30,930
<font color="yellow">That's too plain and boring.</font>

878
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,700
<font color="yellow">Do you think that will work?</font>

879
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,270
<font color="yellow">How much faster was the application than a phone order?</font>

880
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:42,530
<font color="yellow">It's much faster. It takes at least 2 to 3 minutes less.</font>

881
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:45,130
<font color="yellow">Is that 2 to 3 minutes really important to you?</font>

882
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:48,030
<font color="yellow">What can you do instead with that time?</font>

883
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:53,870
<font color="yellow">Do you want to obsess over time like that?</font>

884
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,000
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

885
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,730
<font color="yellow">Just say what you really think.</font>

886
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,770
<font color="yellow">Instead of thinking of what to say,</font>

887
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:07,200
<font color="yellow">just say...</font>

888
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,900
<font color="yellow">what's on your mind. That's enough.</font>

889
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,070
<font color="yellow">Say rough but truthful words.</font>

890
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:19,870
<font color="yellow">That's what's like you.</font>

891
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,300
<font color="yellow">They must be busy around this time.</font>

892
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,270
<font color="yellow">Did you eat?</font>

893
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:55,600
<font color="yellow">If you didn't, have some jjajangmyeon with us.</font>

894
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,430
<font color="yellow">We're about to order.</font>

906
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,600
<font color="yellow">You don't like spicy food.</font>

907
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,500
<font color="yellow">They sounded so busy.</font>

908
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,630
<font color="yellow">Still, you cry when you eat spicy food.</font>

909
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,600
<font color="yellow">It's sweat, not tears.</font>

910

912
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:51,500
<font color="yellow">More people than you think suffer from it.</font>

913
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:56,370
<font color="yellow">Some experts believe that smartphones...</font>

914
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,000

- Yes.</font>

1010
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,430

1013
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,770
<font color="yellow">- Omelet?
- Yes.</font>

1014
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:24,300
<font color="yellow">Make it super thick.</font>

1015
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,700

<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to leave?</font>

1071
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:44,130
<font color="yellow">Well... Is there anything I can help you with?</font>

1072
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,630
<font color="yellow">Is it because today is Christmas Eve?</font>

1073
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:48,600
<font color="yellow">What's up with you today, Boss?</font>

1074
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,200
<font color="yellow">You're acting like Mr. Kang.</font>

1075
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:56,730
<font color="yellow">- Will you be okay?
- Don't worry. Just get going.</font>

1076
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,570
<font color="yellow">I'm not your sister.</font>

1077
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:02,770
<font color="yellow">Why don't you zip me up, then?</font>

1078
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:15,100
<font color="yellow">My sister loved me so much just like how you're with your sister.</font>

1079
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:17,830
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

1080
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,430
<font color="yellow">my sister used to do volunteer work at this orphanage.</font>

1081
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:25,000
<font color="yellow">She always came here on days like today.</font>

1082
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:29,670
<font color="yellow">She went somewhere far away,</font>

1083
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:32,770
<font color="yellow">so I came in her place.</font>

1084
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:37,770
<font color="yellow">I miss my sister.</font>

1085
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:42,040
<font color="yellow">Today, I miss her even more than usual.</font>

1086
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,300
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

1087
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,830
<font color="yellow">The kids are waiting.</font>

1088
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:00,270
<font color="yellow">This is just... Don't mind me.</font>

1089
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,570
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. It's just...</font>

1090
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:05,970
<font color="yellow">Take it off.</font>

1091
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:09,170
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

1092
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:13,430
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

1093
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,270
<font color="yellow">- Take it off.
- Gosh...</font>

1094
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:18,600
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Why should I take it off?</font>

1095
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:24,430
<font color="yellow">Are you going to wear it?</font>

1096
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:28,040
<font color="yellow">No way. You're not actually going to do it, right?</font>

1097
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:33,000
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Why are you...</font>

1098
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,040
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you doing right now?</font>

1099
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:39,900
<font color="yellow">It won't fit you. The costume won't suit you at all.</font>

1100
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:41,970
<font color="yellow">Seriously...</font>

1101
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:45,930
<font color="yellow">You're so weird today.</font>

1102
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,500
<font color="yellow">Why have you changed so much?</font>

1103
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:53,100
<font color="yellow">Because you're Chae Ro Woon.</font>

1104
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:55,200
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

1105
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,040
<font color="yellow">You're Chae Ro Woon,</font>

1106
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,400
<font color="yellow">not Eun Yi Soo.</font>

1107
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:10,600
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

1108
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:14,000
<font color="yellow">Boss, hold on. That's...</font>

1109
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:16,130
<font color="yellow">Hold on!</font>

1110
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:18,830
<font color="yellow">Boss!</font>

1111
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:22,430
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

1112
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:24,900
<font color="yellow">You can't do that.</font>

1113
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,430
<font color="yellow">(MERRY CHRISTMAS!)</font>

1114
01:15:30,170 --> 01:15:31,470
<font color="yellow">Wow, a panda.</font>

1115
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:37,070
<font color="yellow">Isn't it cute?</font>

1116
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:38,630
<font color="yellow">- Yes!
- Yes!</font>

1117
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,170
<font color="yellow">It's okay because my face is covered.</font>

1118
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:52,870
<font color="yellow">It's okay because they're kids.</font>

1119
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:01,700
<font color="yellow">The adults are unexpectedly enjoying it too.</font>

1120
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,570
<font color="yellow">I've changed.</font>

1121
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:21,540
<font color="yellow">(MY SHY BOSS)</font>

1122
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:24,100
<font color="yellow">- Where is Ms. Chae?
- The monkey took the bag.</font>

1123
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:26,500
<font color="yellow">- It snatched it.
- When? Where did it go?</font>

1124
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,770
<font color="yellow">- Why are you following me?
- I'm not.</font>

1125
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:29,370
<font color="yellow">I'm here to find Ro Woon.</font>

1126
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,540
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Hey!</font>

1127
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:34,070
<font color="yellow">There must be a way to communicate with Boss.</font>

1128
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:35,130
<font color="yellow">Don't change.</font>

1129
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:36,730
<font color="yellow">Are you still not settled with Woo Il?</font>

1130
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:38,400
<font color="yellow">Why are you so shy?</font>

1131
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:41,500
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with the boss looking after his staff?</font>

1132
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:43,130
<font color="yellow">My camera. Have you seen it?</font>

1133
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:44,970
<font color="yellow">Did you see the pictures inside it or not?</font>

1134
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,870
<font color="yellow">If he looks like he has a lot on his mind,</font>

1135
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:50,100
<font color="yellow">he needs time and space alone to sort it out.</font>

1136
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,800
<font color="yellow">That's when Hwan Gi will come to you.</font>
