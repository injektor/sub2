64
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,960
<font color="yellow">And we just saved you.</font>

65
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,830

66
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,600

69

<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

70
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,060
<font color="yellow">We're with a 19-year-old girl who is still angry.</font>

71
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,460
<font color="yellow">I never imagined the two of you would be this close.</font>

72
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,900
<font color="yellow">How could you bring the Grim Reaper...</font>

73
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,430
<font color="yellow">to the person who asked you to save her life?</font>

74
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,200
<font color="yellow">I'm curious.</font>

75
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,160
<font color="yellow">When will we hear her thank us...</font>

76
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
<font color="yellow">Quiet already!</font>

77
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,760
<font color="yellow">Why are you yelling at me?</font>

78
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,430
<font color="yellow">Why is there not a single car on this stupid road?</font>

79
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,330
<font color="yellow">Someone made sure there will be no cars on this road for two days.</font>

80
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,800
<font color="yellow">I said to stop talking.</font>

81
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,760
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you leave yet?</font>

82
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,630
<font color="yellow">You said you were leaving.</font>

83
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
<font color="yellow">I will soon.</font>

84
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,630
<font color="yellow">Don't mind me. It's not like I'm all that curious.</font>

85
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,630
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

86
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,360
<font color="yellow">How did you come?</font>

87
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,960
<font color="yellow">I couldn't blow out the flame from the lighter.</font>

88
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,100
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

89
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,630
<font color="yellow">I just heard your saying "Save me," or something like that.</font>

90
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,630
<font color="yellow">But I only thought it in my head.</font>

91
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,860
<font color="yellow">You must think very loudly.</font>

92
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,430
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to come.</font>

93
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,430
<font color="yellow">I had no reason not to.</font>

94
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,300
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

95
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,960
<font color="yellow">You came in the middle of the night to save me who isn't your bride.</font>

96
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,500
<font color="yellow">I thought about it,</font>

97
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,430
<font color="yellow">and you were right when you said...</font>

98
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,030
<font color="yellow">I was living on bonus time.</font>

99
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,600
<font color="yellow">I heard you saved my mom and me 19 years ago.</font>

100
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,600
<font color="yellow">That's why I don't mind that it's bonus time...</font>

101
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,530
<font color="yellow">since I got to meet Mom because I was born. So...</font>

102
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,360
<font color="yellow">I won't hate you anymore.</font>

103
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,330
<font color="yellow">- You seem to hate me.
- I do not.</font>

104
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,630
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell you this if we ever met again...</font>

105
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,060
<font color="yellow">although you probably hoped we wouldn't.</font>

106
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,560
<font color="yellow">- You do seem to hate me.
- I do not.</font>

107
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,360
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

108
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,530
<font color="yellow">I won't make wishes, think,</font>

109
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,360
<font color="yellow">or do anything,</font>

110
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,730
<font color="yellow">so you can relax and leave.</font>

111
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,400
<font color="yellow">I hope you have a safe trip...</font>

112
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,360
<font color="yellow">and meet someone nice.</font>

113
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,500
<font color="yellow">Someone pretty and nice, who will discover your true self.</font>

114
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,630
<font color="yellow">Not her face, but her heart.</font>

115
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,160
<font color="yellow">Since you don't care about looks.</font>

116
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,100
<font color="yellow">It's all cooked now. Go ahead and eat it.</font>

117
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,430
<font color="yellow">I'll get going then.</font>

118
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,330
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

119
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,300
<font color="yellow">Do I have to pay for it when I didn't eat it?</font>

120
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,530
<font color="yellow">You're the one who wanted to eat this.</font>

121
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,030
<font color="yellow">I didn't have any, either.</font>

122
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,500
<font color="yellow">Besides, I don't have money.</font>

123
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,860
<font color="yellow">I will pay for it then. Just make some time for me.</font>

124
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,100
<font color="yellow">Go after you're done.</font>

125
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

126
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,460
<font color="yellow">trying to feed me dinner?</font>

127
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

128
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,460
<font color="yellow">I don't think they fed you before kidnapping you.</font>

129
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,100
<font color="yellow">No. I don't want to eat dinner with you.</font>

130
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,530
<font color="yellow">Or I'll take it home. I'll thankfully eat it.</font>

131
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,530
<font color="yellow">You do hate me.</font>

132
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,300
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

133
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,430
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak lost her parents when she was little.</font>

134
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,330
<font color="yellow">She was maltreated by her aunt and her cousins.</font>

135
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,860
<font color="yellow">Oh, poor little Eun Tak. She must've cried a lot.</font>

136
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,160
<font color="yellow">Here's the list of people who made her cry.</font>

137
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,260
<font color="yellow">Her aunt and her cousins.</font>

138
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,930
<font color="yellow">We don't even have to dig deep.</font>

139
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,700
<font color="yellow">Everyone in the town knows about it.</font>

140
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,960
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak's mother left her about 150,000 dollars of insurance money.</font>

141
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,230
<font color="yellow">They're abusing her now because they can't do anything when she turns 18.</font>

142
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,600
<font color="yellow">That the type of person she is.</font>

143
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,330
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

144
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,430
<font color="yellow">I'm surprised that you're actually useful.</font>

145
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,830
<font color="yellow">If you're a rich person, you have...</font>

146
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,900
<font color="yellow">to use money and power to dig into someone's background at least once.</font>

147
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,000
<font color="yellow">Where did you get these pictures?</font>

148
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,230
<font color="yellow">I followed them and took them.</font>

149
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,430
<font color="yellow">But I didn't see Eun Tak. I think she's busy.</font>

150
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,530
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

151
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,760
<font color="yellow">It's me. I look nice in it.</font>

152
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,160
<font color="yellow">By the way, why did you ask me to do this?</font>

153
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,530
<font color="yellow">To punish them.</font>

154
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

155
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,960
<font color="yellow">Are you not well?</font>

156
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,330
<font color="yellow">That's not a punishment. That's gold.</font>

157
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,570
<font color="yellow">How can you punish someone by giving them gold?</font>

158
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,330
<font color="yellow">- How about me?
- Good job.</font>

159
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,530
<font color="yellow">How about me?</font>

160
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,630
<font color="yellow">Why don't I get a gold bar?</font>

161
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,600
<font color="yellow">Didn't I commit a lot of sins?</font>

162
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,700
<font color="yellow">Don't I deserve to receive divine punishment?</font>

163
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,330
<font color="yellow">Did they kidnap her or what?</font>

164
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,570
<font color="yellow">Why aren't they calling?</font>

165
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,830
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, you morons.</font>

166
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,700
<font color="yellow">Don't you see that your mother is in pain?</font>

167
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,460
<font color="yellow">Idiots.</font>

168
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,160
<font color="yellow">My money is about to get in the hands of those punks.</font>

169
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,070
<font color="yellow">You borrowed it anyway.</font>

170
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,200
<font color="yellow">Yes, I should've starved both of you to death.</font>

171
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,330
<font color="yellow">Our life now is not any better anyway.</font>

172
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,730
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm the idiot.</font>

173
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,460
<font color="yellow">Why did I have children one year after another?</font>

174
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,930
<font color="yellow">- What is this?
- It's gold, you idiot.</font>

175
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,200
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak changed all the money into these gold bars.</font>

176
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,630
<font color="yellow">This is why she kept saying she didn't have a bankbook.</font>

177
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,930
<font color="yellow">This is why she doesn't have a bankbook.</font>

178
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,260
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the jeweler's as soon as the day breaks.</font>

179
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,600
<font color="yellow">As we promised, we will divide it evenly among us.</font>

180
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,200
<font color="yellow">Do any funny business, and I will...</font>

181
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,900
<font color="yellow">I'm your mother, you moron.</font>

182
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,260
<font color="yellow">- Give it to me.
- Let it go.</font>

183
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,600
<font color="yellow">- Let it go!
- No!</font>

186
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,900
<font color="yellow">That wench!</font>

187
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,570
<font color="yellow">Her phone's busy.</font>

188
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,360
<font color="yellow">I know. She's talking to someone.</font>

189
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,430
<font color="yellow">Whom is she talking to?</font>

190
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,800
<font color="yellow">It's you, you moron.</font>

191
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
<font color="yellow">Hang up!</font>

192
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,700
<font color="yellow">Get the taxi.</font>

193
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,230
<font color="yellow">- Taxi!
- Taxi!</font>

194
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,530
<font color="yellow">- I'm in a hurry!
- Move!</font>

195
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,960
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Go.</font>

196
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,930
<font color="yellow">Yes, Grandpa. Uncle's eating now.</font>

197
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,570
<font color="yellow">No, he just had a bite.</font>

198
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,700
<font color="yellow">I even put kimchi on his plate.</font>

199
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,180
<font color="yellow">He's eating seolleongtang.</font>

200
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,680
<font color="yellow">Okay. Okay.</font>

201
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,170
<font color="yellow">By the way, my credit card...</font>

202
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,630
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

203
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,430
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

204
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,160
<font color="yellow">Actually, this problem will be solved if you say just a word...</font>

205
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,670
<font color="yellow">Uncle, did you hear what I said?</font>

206
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,100
<font color="yellow">What are you watching?</font>

207
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,630
<font color="yellow">I'm watching the television.</font>

208
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,500
<font color="yellow">He's a pitiful man.</font>

209
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,050
<font color="yellow">I should pity him, not get angry at him.</font>

210
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,720
<font color="yellow">He was just about that age.</font>

211
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,220
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

212
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,120
<font color="yellow">The King I used to guard.</font>

213
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,750
<font color="yellow">He was 17 years old.</font>

214
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,120
<font color="yellow">You used to guard a king?</font>

215
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,690
<font color="yellow">That's crazy.</font>

216
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,920
<font color="yellow">Were you a eunuch?</font>

217
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,490
<font color="yellow">I was his clothes.</font>

218
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,920
<font color="yellow">Pity him, Deok Hwa.</font>

219
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,820
<font color="yellow">He needs your help.</font>

220
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,020
<font color="yellow">It was the brightest time of the day.</font>

221
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,350
<font color="yellow">My eyes hurt,</font>

222
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,290
<font color="yellow">so I constantly resented someone.</font>

223
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,850
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if it was the King, the divinity,</font>

224
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,220
<font color="yellow">or me.</font>

225
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,950
<font color="yellow">I forgot.</font>

226
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,990
<font color="yellow">Is it him?</font>

227
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,090
<font color="yellow">Who is?</font>

228
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,850
<font color="yellow">The person who caused my 1,000 years of rage.</font>

229
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,690
<font color="yellow">The reincarnation of the King who slew me.</font>

230
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,220
<font color="yellow">Look carefully.</font>

231
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,020
<font color="yellow">Did he reincarnate?</font>

232
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,090
<font color="yellow">I don't know, either. He'd be that age if he reincarnated.</font>

233
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,890
<font color="yellow">He was a eunuch. "Your Highness."</font>

234
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,220
<font color="yellow">Forget.</font>

235
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,420
<font color="yellow">The resentment and the desire for revenge are making you miserable.</font>

236
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,020
<font color="yellow">Are you happy because you don't remember anything?</font>

237
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,020
<font color="yellow">I can't tell by just looking.</font>

238
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,090
<font color="yellow">- I have to touch him to know.
- What?</font>

239
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,990
<font color="yellow">You are completely useless.</font>

240
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,590
<font color="yellow">What will you know when you touch him?</font>

241
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,990
<font color="yellow">By the way, why are you so sure that he reincarnated as a man?</font>

242
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
<font color="yellow">- Is it her?
- I can't tell by just looking.</font>

243
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
<font color="yellow">I have to touch them to know.</font>

244
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,450
<font color="yellow">What happens when you touch someone?</font>

245
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,750
<font color="yellow">It's her, right? Tell me that it's her.</font>

246
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,890
<font color="yellow">I think I'm ready to forgive her.</font>

247
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,150
<font color="yellow">You said it was your 1,000 years of rage.</font>

248
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,790
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he had his reasons.</font>

249
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,820
<font color="yellow">As you know, rage is found everywhere and nowhere.</font>

250
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,520
<font color="yellow">What is it? What will he know when he touches them?</font>

251
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,220
<font color="yellow">Why are you leaving me hanging?</font>

252
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,320
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

253
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,850
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir! I'm Kim from Batch 21.</font>

254
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,050
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir! I'm Kim from Batch 23.</font>

255
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,750
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you, too. Take a seat.</font>

256
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,690
<font color="yellow">- Yes, we will work hard, Sir!
- Yes, we will work hard, Sir!</font>

257
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,320
<font color="yellow">They are so young and fresh.</font>

258
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,590
<font color="yellow">We were once like them, too.</font>

259
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,950
<font color="yellow">I am Kim from Batch 21.</font>

260
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
<font color="yellow">At ease.</font>

261
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,890
<font color="yellow">- Yes, we will work hard, Sir!
- Yes, we will work hard, Sir!</font>

262
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,850
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

263
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,790
<font color="yellow">By the way, why don't you check your work email?</font>

264
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,420
<font color="yellow">About the missing ones...</font>

265
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,390
<font color="yellow">A new team has been formed to take charge of them.</font>

266
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,020
<font color="yellow">Please submit a list before the year-end.</font>

267
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,150
<font color="yellow">I don't have any.</font>

268
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,590
<font color="yellow">You have two, don't you?</font>

269
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,990
<font color="yellow">Who says I have two missing ones?</font>

270
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,990
<font color="yellow">Everyone says that you have two missing ones.</font>

271
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,420
<font color="yellow">- I'll submit it right away.
- That will be much appreciated.</font>

272
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,020
<font color="yellow">I have business to take care of, so I will get going now.</font>

273
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,020
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at the winter workshop.</font>

274
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,590
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

275
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,220
<font color="yellow">It's her.</font>

276
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
<font color="yellow">It's her.</font>

277
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,990
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

278
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,020
<font color="yellow">I'm Kim from Batch 23.</font>

279
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,050
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

280
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,320
<font color="yellow">- I'll get going.
- Go ahead.</font>

281
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
<font color="yellow">She's beautiful.</font>

282
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,850
<font color="yellow">She should be an angel. Why is she a grim reaper?</font>

283
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,050
<font color="yellow">Her batch mates are thrilled because of her.</font>

284
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,520
<font color="yellow">You look very thrilled about her, too.</font>

285
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,520
<font color="yellow">Clear the way.</font>

286
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,190
<font color="yellow">- Move.
- Move.</font>

287
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,790
<font color="yellow">- Honey.
- This way.</font>

288
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,090
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

289
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
<font color="yellow">Honey...</font>

290
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,190
<font color="yellow">Well, then.</font>

291
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,320
<font color="yellow">Okay. Oh, right.</font>

292
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,520
<font color="yellow">There's a welcoming party for Batch 23 at the end of this month.</font>

293
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,890
<font color="yellow">There's a penalty for not showing up. Make sure not to show up.</font>

294
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,120
<font color="yellow">I'm Kim from Batch 21.</font>

295
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,020
<font color="yellow">I'm Kim from Batch 21.</font>

296
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,150
<font color="yellow">Did you book an OR?</font>

297
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,650
<font color="yellow">We don't have time. Hurry up.</font>

298
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,950
<font color="yellow">Mr. Choi Yeong Jae.</font>

299
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,520
<font color="yellow">I am sorry, but I'm occupied at the moment. Stay outside.</font>

300
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
<font color="yellow">You're 33 years old.</font>

301
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,090
<font color="yellow">You die on October 4, 2016.</font>

302
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,090
<font color="yellow">Time of death is 5:41pm.</font>

303
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,320
<font color="yellow">Cause of death is overworking.</font>

304
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,990
<font color="yellow">It's you, isn't it?</font>

305
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,220
<font color="yellow">Did I...</font>

306
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,290

<font color="yellow">I am... I am his friend.</font>

372
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,840
<font color="yellow">- I'm visiting.
- Oh, you're visiting a friend.</font>

373
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,340
<font color="yellow">You must be my uncle's best friend.</font>

374
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,270
<font color="yellow">Are you throwing him a party before he goes abroad?</font>

<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

376
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,540

377
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,140
<font color="yellow">Be happy for a long time. Stay until you die.</font>

378
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,670
<font color="yellow">You can leave instead. We aren't friends.</font>

379
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,170
<font color="yellow">Get out of my house. Never come back.</font>

380
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,540
<font color="yellow">Uncle, you can't say that to your best friend.</font>

381
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,940
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're an exception? Get out as fast as you can.</font>

382
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,540
<font color="yellow">How could he do that?</font>

383
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,380
<font color="yellow">- Wasn't that just too mean?
- It was.</font>

384
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,670
<font color="yellow">Right? How could he kick me out as well?</font>

385
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,670
<font color="yellow">Would a real relative have done that?</font>

386
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,440
<font color="yellow">- He won't stay for long.
- I hope so.</font>

387
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,010
<font color="yellow">Or you'll have to come with me.</font>

388
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:11,970
<font color="yellow">To some place.</font>

389
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:16,070

390
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,240
<font color="yellow">- Come in.
- No thanks.</font>

391
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,040
<font color="yellow">- Even if you beg me to...
- Not you.</font>

392
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,710
<font color="yellow">Go home and get yelled at.</font>

393
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,940

394
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,380

395
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,710
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

396
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:46,880
<font color="yellow">Did you tell my grandpa everything?</font>

397
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,340
<font color="yellow">How could you do that?</font>

398
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,440
<font color="yellow">How much did you tell him? Tell me so I can make an excuse.</font>

399
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,610
<font color="yellow">Did you tell me before you rented out my house?</font>

400
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,710
<font color="yellow">I won't go.</font>

401
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,840
<font color="yellow">I'm not going anywhere.</font>

402
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,110

403
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,910
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

404
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,710

00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,010
<font color="yellow">I have much interest in music and arts as well.</font>

461
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,910
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to have bothered you when you were reading.</font>

462
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,070
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

463
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,170
<font color="yellow">Why are you bothering me?</font>

464
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,140
<font color="yellow">I didn't call you. It was a mistake.</font>

465
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,170
<font color="yellow">I was grilling squid when it caught on fire, so I had to blow it out.</font>

466
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,440
<font color="yellow">Was it tasty?</font>

467
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,340
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? I thought you were leaving.</font>

468
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,110
<font color="yellow">I was packing my books.</font>

469
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,380
<font color="yellow">Books come first.</font>

470
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,240
<font color="yellow">- I better go and pack.
- Hey...</font>

471
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,410
<font color="yellow">You always talk to me when I try to leave.</font>

472
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,940
<font color="yellow">It's the other way around. You always leave when I talk.</font>

473
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,340
<font color="yellow">- I have something to ask.
- I'm not giving you 5,000 dollars.</font>

474
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,440
<font color="yellow">You surprised me.</font>

475
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,940
<font color="yellow">I thought you said you won't profess to me.</font>

476
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,040
<font color="yellow">It's because you just assumed and said something so random.</font>

477
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,510
<font color="yellow">Since when is it all my fault?</font>

478
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,640
<font color="yellow">Since when you told me I should be seeing something.</font>

479
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,880
<font color="yellow">So what exactly is it that I should be seeing...</font>

480
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,410
<font color="yellow">to become useful to you?</font>

481
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,610
<font color="yellow">If I tell you, are you going to tell me you can see it?</font>

482
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,710
<font color="yellow">No. I'd tell you I can't see it even if I can.</font>

483
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:25,470
<font color="yellow">What if you start being nice to me because I can see it?</font>

484
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,540
<font color="yellow">You might suddenly give me 5,000 dollars and buy me steak.</font>

485
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,840
<font color="yellow">You might even ask me if I want anything.</font>

486
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,070
<font color="yellow">Then I'd be so tired since you're so annoying.</font>

487
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,510
<font color="yellow">I've never heard such a thing.</font>

488
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,040
<font color="yellow">I swear. I've never heard it before.</font>

489
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,640
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm talking. What are you looking at?</font>

490
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,110
<font color="yellow">Don't answer me if you don't want to.</font>

491
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,770
<font color="yellow">Don't you see something special?</font>

492
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,840
<font color="yellow">It should look painful.</font>

493
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,340
<font color="yellow">That?</font>

494
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,770
<font color="yellow">- Can you see it?
- I get it now.</font>

495
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,410
<font color="yellow">Bye. I'm busy, so I have to go.</font>

496
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,510
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you want to eat steak? Do you want anything?</font>

497
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,340
<font color="yellow">- I want 5,000 dollars.
- I thought you were busy.</font>

498
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,040
<font color="yellow">- Go.
- Then I want meat.</font>

499
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

500
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:33,064
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU</font>

501
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,340
<font color="yellow">That was the last piece.</font>

502
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,840
<font color="yellow">Can you see it?</font>

503
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

504
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,910
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious.</font>

505
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,810
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the food.</font>

506
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,010
<font color="yellow">I asked if you can see it. You can't, can you?</font>

507
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,470
<font color="yellow">Are you snapping at me?</font>

508
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,040
<font color="yellow">Did it sound like that?</font>

509
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,310
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

510
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,110
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

511
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,640
<font color="yellow">I was just going to ask if you want freshly squeezed juice after this.</font>

512
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,340
<font color="yellow">Sorry if my voice got too sharp.</font>

513
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,540
<font color="yellow">Freshly squeezed juice?</font>

514
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,170
<font color="yellow">Which one do you want? You can get an expensive one.</font>

515
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:20,070
<font color="yellow">I'm full.</font>

516
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,810
<font color="yellow">I'll get a large one of that.</font>

517
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,440
<font color="yellow">You're not full.</font>

518
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,070
<font color="yellow">Me, too. Get me the same one.</font>

519
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,640
<font color="yellow">I'll help you with the payment.</font>

520
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,470
<font color="yellow">She'll help you over there.</font>

521
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,240
<font color="yellow">I'm not paying for him.</font>

522
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,640
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you?</font>

523
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,210
<font color="yellow">I thought you hated fruits.</font>

524
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,670
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

525
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,640
<font color="yellow">Are you killing someone in the area?</font>

526
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,810
<font color="yellow">I'm a regular here.</font>

527
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,010
<font color="yellow">Is it me?</font>

528
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,640
<font color="yellow">Am I dying here today?</font>

529
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,370
<font color="yellow">Did I...</font>

530
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,540
<font color="yellow">get lured in by meat...</font>

531
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,270
<font color="yellow">and then get caught in the trap with this juice?</font>

532
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,810
<font color="yellow">Are you two really a team?</font>

533
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,270
<font color="yellow">No, it's a misunderstanding.</font>

534
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,870
<font color="yellow">I'm actually on your side.</font>

535
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,470
<font color="yellow">You can see the sword.</font>

536
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,810
<font color="yellow">Pull out the sword.</font>

537
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,710
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

538
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:18,170
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Why are you on my side?</font>

539
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,970
<font color="yellow">What's with her? Why can't I control her?</font>

540
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,940
<font color="yellow">She's not someone you can predict.</font>

541
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,210
<font color="yellow">That means I'll have a lot of supplementary documents to hand in.</font>

542
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,170
<font color="yellow">Have a good time.</font>

543
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,540
<font color="yellow">I have a meeting to go to.</font>

544
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,540
<font color="yellow">Did he really come to drink juice?</font>

545
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,070
<font color="yellow">That's interesting.</font>

546
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,440
<font color="yellow">By the way, why is he saying that he's on my side?</font>

547
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,670
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

548
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:52,370
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't you think he's handsome for no use?</font>

549
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,910
<font color="yellow">Is it because people tend to follow a handsome grim reaper?</font>

550
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,840
<font color="yellow">Maybe they only hire handsome ones.</font>

551
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,540
<font color="yellow">Are all grim reapers handsome?</font>

552
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,510
<font color="yellow">Do you call that handsome?</font>

553
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,740
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's handsome.</font>

554
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,740
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

555
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:12,070
<font color="yellow">You're...</font>

556
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,770
<font color="yellow">just looking.</font>

557
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:19,870
<font color="yellow">Stop drinking.</font>

558
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,640
<font color="yellow">You're full.</font>

559
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,240
<font color="yellow">That guy is handsome, too.</font>

560
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,970
<font color="yellow">I guess only good looking people come here.</font>

561
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,670
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there. See you soon.</font>

562
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,270
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

563
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:47,110
<font color="yellow">Yes, Honey. I'll be there soon. I miss you.</font>

564
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,210
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

565
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,240
<font color="yellow">Something everyone hopes to happen to them.</font>

566
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,670
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

567
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:11,970
<font color="yellow">Magic.</font>

568
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,810
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

569
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,980
<font color="yellow">- I'll untie it.
- Pardon? Oh, gosh.</font>

570
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:20,980
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

571
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:32,750
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

572
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,080
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Okay...</font>

573
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,680
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

574
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,980
<font color="yellow">- It's okay.
- Well...</font>

575
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,250
<font color="yellow">It's untied now.</font>

576
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,010
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

577
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,250
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

578
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,010
<font color="yellow">This is a very strange day.</font>

579
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,750
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm enchanted.</font>

580
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:10,110
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which,</font>

581
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,310
<font color="yellow">do you...</font>

582
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,010
<font color="yellow">have a boyfriend?</font>

583
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:15,480
<font color="yellow">No. My parents are very strict.</font>

584
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,380
<font color="yellow">- I see.
- Do you...</font>

585
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,210
<font color="yellow">have a girlfriend?</font>

586
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,650
<font color="yellow">Never in my life.</font>

587
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:23,910
<font color="yellow">I've been waiting for you all this time.</font>

588
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:32,710
<font color="yellow">Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.</font>

589
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,380
<font color="yellow">Do you have a second job as Cupid?</font>

590
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:37,780
<font color="yellow">That was you being their guardian, wasn't it?</font>

591
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,980
<font color="yellow">One or two in a century...</font>

592
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:43,050
<font color="yellow">are reincarnated with the same faces from their previous lives.</font>

593
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:46,250
<font color="yellow">I know that man from his previous life.</font>

594
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,380
<font color="yellow">He can't afford to lose that woman.</font>

595
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,380
<font color="yellow">What was his previous life like?</font>

596
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,810
<font color="yellow">Did he save our nation when it was in crisis?</font>

597
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,810
<font color="yellow">In his previous life,</font>

598
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,910
<font color="yellow">he was a farm owner...</font>

599
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,780
<font color="yellow">who used to leach off of impoverished peasants.</font>

600
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,850
<font color="yellow">Then why help him?</font>

601
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:08,110
<font color="yellow">Are you a guardian for bad people as well?</font>

602
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:09,610
<font color="yellow">That's not fair.</font>

603
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,910
<font color="yellow">The good people are the ones who need your help.</font>

604
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,510
<font color="yellow">I'm not their guardian.</font>

605
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:17,150
<font color="yellow">I'm the guardian of the man and woman they just lost.</font>

606
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,080
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

607
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:22,110
<font color="yellow">I love you, too.</font>

608
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,350
<font color="yellow">I miss you. I'm on my way.</font>

609
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:26,380
<font color="yellow">You don't need to rush. I don't want you to trip.</font>

610
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,380
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

611
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,150
<font color="yellow">The man is a liar and a coward.</font>

612
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,010
<font color="yellow">The woman is vain and ungrateful.</font>

613
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:37,650
<font color="yellow">Those two will become each other's nightmares.</font>

614
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:40,250
<font color="yellow">You're cool.</font>

615
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,210
<font color="yellow">From time to time, I meddle...</font>

616
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,180
<font color="yellow">with the lives of mortals by enchanting them.</font>

617
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:48,810
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

618
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:52,450
<font color="yellow">can I ask why you're talking like an actor in a historical drama?</font>

619
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,150
<font color="yellow">I don't know why.</font>

620
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,820
<font color="yellow">That being said,</font>

621
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:03,280
<font color="yellow">is it because I sinned greatly...</font>

622
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:06,380
<font color="yellow">in my previous life and I'm being punished for it now?</font>

623
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,780
<font color="yellow">Is it my punishment...</font>

624
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:10,380
<font color="yellow">that I was born as the goblin's bride?</font>

625
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,210
<font color="yellow">I am not acquainted with your previous life.</font>

626
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,610
<font color="yellow">You're too young to evaluate your life.</font>

627
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:21,310
<font color="yellow">And you're not the goblin's bride.</font>

628
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:23,880
<font color="yellow">I thought I could fool you.</font>

629
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:27,550
<font color="yellow">I know I had my ups and downs, but I like the life I'm living.</font>

630
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:30,010
<font color="yellow">I was greatly loved by my mom.</font>

631
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,380
<font color="yellow">I even found myself an umbrella.</font>

632
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,080
<font color="yellow">I'm pleased to have met you.</font>

633
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,080
<font color="yellow">Was. Was pleased.</font>

634
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,610
<font color="yellow">You hold grudges.</font>

635
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,480
<font color="yellow">And you haven't answered me on whether or not you see it.</font>

636
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:48,350
<font color="yellow">Do you see it or not?</font>

637
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,980
<font color="yellow">This is what my mom said.</font>

638
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,950
<font color="yellow">"We should watch where we place our feet before we take a step..."</font>

639
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:55,850
<font color="yellow">"and always know where we're headed."</font>

640
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,350
<font color="yellow">You know what that means, right?</font>

641
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,710
<font color="yellow">No. I don't.</font>

642
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,180
<font color="yellow">It means this is where we part ways.</font>

643
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,180
<font color="yellow">I'm going that way.</font>

644
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:11,010
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

645
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,050
<font color="yellow">You're cool.</font>

646
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,110
<font color="yellow">You look cool.</font>

647
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,010
<font color="yellow">Just now, you looked like a part of a painting.</font>

648
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:26,310
<font color="yellow">Where's the other uncle?</font>

649
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,650
<font color="yellow">- He's not home.
- He must be working late.</font>

650
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,850
<font color="yellow">Uncle, I had a thought.</font>

651
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:35,650
<font color="yellow">I think I should become a grim reaper when I die.</font>

652
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,150
<font color="yellow">At the end of the hallway of life,</font>

653
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,150
<font color="yellow">death awaits me.</font>

654
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,010
<font color="yellow">I'll be welcomed by Grim Reaper himself.</font>

655
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,010
<font color="yellow">In your dreams.</font>

656
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:43,710
<font color="yellow">You're short of million sins.</font>

657
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,150
<font color="yellow">I don't want to break it to you,</font>

658
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,950
<font color="yellow">but only those who sinned greatly can become...</font>

659
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,150
<font color="yellow">What kind of great sins?</font>

660
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,110
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

661
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,380
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Did he kill someone?</font>

662
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,180
<font color="yellow">You can never judge a book by its cover.</font>

663
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,010
<font color="yellow">Not that. How did you know he's a grim reaper?</font>

664
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:04,350
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

665
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,750
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it's too late for you to ask me that?</font>

666
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,810
<font color="yellow">Remember when you made the room cloudy and thunder,</font>

667
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:12,880
<font color="yellow">I got nervous when I saw him come out of his room.</font>

668
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,810
<font color="yellow">But he didn't even flinch by the slightest.</font>

669
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,710
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with him?
- And I heard you talking about...</font>

670
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,110
<font color="yellow">how a grim reaper like him can foresee the future and everything.</font>

671
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,980
<font color="yellow">Watch your mouth, Grim Reaper.</font>

672
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,010
<font color="yellow">Don't underestimate my power to foresee the future.</font>

673
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:27,610
<font color="yellow">That's not all. Just look at his pale skin and bloody red lips.</font>

674
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:29,180
<font color="yellow">And why does he only wear black?</font>

675
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,750
<font color="yellow">I thought he looked dashing.</font>

676
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,510
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

677
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,980
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

678
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,180
<font color="yellow">How did you know that I'm a grim reaper?</font>

679
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,380
<font color="yellow">How can I not know when you do things like that?</font>

680
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,280
<font color="yellow">You just teleported here.</font>

681
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,150
<font color="yellow">You guys should really be more cautious.</font>

682
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,980
<font color="yellow">You guys are so carefree.</font>

683
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:02,950
<font color="yellow">You blew my cover.</font>

684
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,910
<font color="yellow">You talked about me behind my back, Goblin.</font>

685
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,210
<font color="yellow">How can you blame me with the way you behave?</font>

686
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,580
<font color="yellow">You could've been a murderer in your previous life for all I know.</font>

687

688
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:26,510
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're being punished for not sinning at all.</font>

689
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,280
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

690
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,380
<font color="yellow">You must've hurt him.</font>

691
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:38,610
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

692
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,010
<font color="yellow">Can't you see that I have no clue?</font>

693
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:44,710
<font color="yellow">Great sin, is it?</font>

694
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,380
<font color="yellow">Disobedience.</font>

695
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,910
<font color="yellow">Disloyalty.</font>

696
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,380
<font color="yellow">Insolence.</font>

697
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:57,950
<font color="yellow">Immorality.</font>

698
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,650
<font color="yellow">Infidelity.</font>

699
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,680
<font color="yellow">Let's not go there.</font>

700
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,450
<font color="yellow">- It's probably not the case.
- No, it's not.</font>

701
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,810
<font color="yellow">What is it? What are you going to do now?</font>

702
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,080
<font color="yellow">Act of responsibility.</font>

703
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:19,310
<font color="yellow">Willingness to become better.</font>

704
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:20,750
<font color="yellow">People call it, "apology".</font>

705
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,880
<font color="yellow">I apologize for the slip of my tongue.</font>

706
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,850
<font color="yellow">What did I not do among these?</font>

707
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,710
<font color="yellow">- Disobedience?
- Get out.</font>

708
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,810
<font color="yellow">I did it again. I thought you'd laugh.</font>

709
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,450
<font color="yellow">- Get out.
- Your previous life doesn't matter.</font>

710
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:38,550
<font color="yellow">I don't care what you did or who you were in your previous life.</font>

711
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:40,950
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes.</font>

712
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,450
<font color="yellow">No matter what you did, I'll hate you just the same.</font>

713
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:51,810
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't laugh.</font>

714
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,550
<font color="yellow">When they first met,</font>

715
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,180
<font color="yellow">I thought Uncle would kick him out in an instance.</font>

716
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,580
<font color="yellow">But they're strangely good together.</font>

717
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:04,210
<font color="yellow">One is suffering from losing the memory of the previous life.</font>

718
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:07,910
<font color="yellow">The other is suffering because he can't forget.</font>

719
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:12,080
<font color="yellow">The two are depending on each other.</font>

720
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,310
<font color="yellow">You and I...</font>

721
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:20,010
<font color="yellow">are rest stops they dwell with...</font>

722
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,450
<font color="yellow">in their long, long lives.</font>

723
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,250
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

724
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:28,810
<font color="yellow">Wait, you knew about it as well?</font>

725
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,950
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

726
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,980
<font color="yellow">I'm worried they might blow their covers out there.</font>

727
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,050
<font color="yellow">You just worry about yourself.</font>

728
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:38,550
<font color="yellow">Raise your arms straight.</font>

729
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,510
<font color="yellow">Straighten your back.</font>

730
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,350
<font color="yellow">I can't be your grandson.</font>

731
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,610
<font color="yellow">You couldn't do this to your blood-related grandson.</font>

732
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,910
<font color="yellow">- I'll have my revenge.
- Punk!</font>

733
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,670
<font color="yellow">As you know, Mr. Kim,</font>

734
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:23,000
<font color="yellow">this building was a present for my eighth birthday.</font>

735
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,740
<font color="yellow">I know. What did you get when you turned nine?</font>

736
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,340
<font color="yellow">A lot of hate. Not for long, though.</font>

737
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,480
<font color="yellow">Now that I'm a grown adult...</font>

738
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,510
<font color="yellow">You know they still hate you, right?</font>

739
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:34,510
<font color="yellow">You spend so much money like a grown up.</font>

740
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:36,340
<font color="yellow">So you canceled my credit cards.</font>

741
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:41,010
<font color="yellow">That's why I plan on making some cash with this building.</font>

742
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,710
<font color="yellow">Have the tenants move out. The less trouble the better.</font>

743
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:47,240
<font color="yellow">Start with the out-of-business fried chicken restaurant.</font>

744
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,640
<font color="yellow">There are a few things you must know.</font>

745
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,840
<font color="yellow">First, do you see the sign that says "closed"?</font>

746
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,580
<font color="yellow">The store isn't open yet. It's not out of business.</font>

747
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,210
<font color="yellow">Second, I'm not here to do your bidding.</font>

748
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:02,040
<font color="yellow">I'm tailing you because the chairman ordered me to.</font>

749
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,510
<font color="yellow">You tailed me in the open?</font>

750
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,780
<font color="yellow">I thought you were with me.</font>

751
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:11,480
<font color="yellow">Let's do this, then. You will soon get a call.</font>

752
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,280
<font color="yellow">A woman will ask if I work there.</font>

753
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,840
<font color="yellow">You just have to say that I do. That's all you need to do.</font>

754
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:19,140
<font color="yellow">You don't work there.</font>

755
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:24,140
<font color="yellow">Come on, Mr. Kim. You're way too honest.</font>

756
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,240
<font color="yellow">My grandpa must be pleased you work for him.</font>

757
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,980
<font color="yellow">I need to make a new credit card.</font>

758
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,310
<font color="yellow">Please? Just this once.</font>

759
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:49,880
<font color="yellow">Going somewhere?</font>

760
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,640
<font color="yellow">- To the store.
- The store?</font>

761
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,510
<font color="yellow">Your excuses are getting lamer.</font>

762
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,510
<font color="yellow">Don't you see the Eco bag?</font>

763
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,680
<font color="yellow">I didn't know the purpose of it.</font>

764
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:14,280
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you tagged along. Don't you trust me?</font>

765
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:15,710
<font color="yellow">Could I?</font>

766
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:20,940
<font color="yellow">You were going to see her but came here when I tagged along.</font>

767
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,840
<font color="yellow">You went to the cafe to get her, but I got you first.</font>

768
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,910
<font color="yellow">I won't take her.</font>

769
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,580
<font color="yellow">I'm actually rooting for her.</font>

770
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,410
<font color="yellow">Why would you root for her?</font>

771
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,010
<font color="yellow">I'm on her side. You die when the bride takes the sword out.</font>

772
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,310
<font color="yellow">It'd be better for you to disappear forever...</font>

773
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,280
<font color="yellow">instead of taking a trip abroad.</font>

774
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,280
<font color="yellow">She can't see the sword yet,</font>

775
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:44,010
<font color="yellow">but I'm hoping for a miracle that she might notice it later.</font>

776
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:46,280
<font color="yellow">I'm betting all I have on that day.</font>

777
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,480
<font color="yellow">There are people watching.</font>

778
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,210
<font color="yellow">Fine, then. Make a promise.</font>

779
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,480
<font color="yellow">What promise?</font>

780
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,610
<font color="yellow">That you won't harm her if I leave.</font>

781
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,010
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

782
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:10,680
<font color="yellow">- Are you really leaving?
- However,</font>

783
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,910
<font color="yellow">if you try to take her, I'll come right back.</font>

784
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,740
<font color="yellow">Leave her alone.</font>

785
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:21,340
<font color="yellow">When will you leave?</font>

786
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,210
<font color="yellow">In two days. Happy now?</font>

787
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,610
<font color="yellow">Did someone see you?</font>

788
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,810
<font color="yellow">You can't come to where I live.</font>

789
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,080
<font color="yellow">My aunt will kill us both. Did she see you?</font>

790
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,340
<font color="yellow">Is she asleep?</font>

791
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:29,480
<font color="yellow">- I don't know.
- You scared me.</font>

792
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:37,040
<font color="yellow">What were you doing outside my house?</font>

793
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,610
<font color="yellow">Are you here to see me?</font>

794
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,680
<font color="yellow">Maybe.</font>

795
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,080
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

796
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:49,480
<font color="yellow">I must have thought of you for a while.</font>

797
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,740
<font color="yellow">I guess that's why I ended up here.</font>

798
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,040
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

799
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,980
<font color="yellow">I'm not your bride and I'm not pretty.</font>

800
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:04,780
<font color="yellow">I'm just a load of trouble. You always have to save me.</font>

801
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,640
<font color="yellow">Why did you come to see me?</font>

802
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,410
<font color="yellow">I guess I missed that about you.</font>

803
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,340
<font color="yellow">I saw you, so I can go now. Your aunt disappeared.</font>

804
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,380
<font color="yellow">The house is empty. Go on inside.</font>

805
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,780
<font color="yellow">My aunt disappeared?</font>

806
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,240
<font color="yellow">Really? When?</font>

807
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,080
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here if you didn't know?</font>

808
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,310
<font color="yellow">I came to get something I left behind.</font>

809
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,840
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

810
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,140
<font color="yellow">It's just a thing.</font>

811
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,640
<font color="yellow">You don't need to know.</font>

812
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,610
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

813
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:56,710
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

814
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,810
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr. Man in Black.</font>

815
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,940
<font color="yellow">Don't you need a hairpin?</font>

816
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:58,510
<font color="yellow">Hairpins aren't my thing.</font>

817
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,080
<font color="yellow">Get one for your girlfriend.</font>

818
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,080
<font color="yellow">I don't have one.</font>

819
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:05,640
<font color="yellow">Girlfriends come and go, you know.</font>

820
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,740
<font color="yellow">Once you buy one, it's yours forever.</font>

821
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:12,610

824
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,680
<font color="yellow">I picked it up first.</font>

825
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,610
<font color="yellow">Are you crying?</font>

826
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:07,710
<font color="yellow">Do you want it?</font>

827
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:20,210
<font color="yellow">It's not for free.</font>

828
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,740
<font color="yellow">Give me your number.</font>

829
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:26,240
<font color="yellow">- I don't have one.
- You don't have a phone?</font>

830
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:30,740

<font color="yellow">You just don't want to give me your number.</font>

832
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,480
<font color="yellow">The ring is mine, then.</font>

833

<font color="yellow">Give me your number. Write it down...</font>

834
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,440

836
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:54,610

837
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,110
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you.</font>

838
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,180

<font color="yellow">Sun Hee?</font>

840
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,380

841
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,410
<font color="yellow">It's a fake name anyway, so anything goes.</font>

842
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:29,780
<font color="yellow">Credit card?</font>

843
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,040
<font color="yellow">Or cash?</font>

844
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,780

853
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:00,600
<font color="yellow">You should go.</font>

01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,430

862
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:50,500

<font color="yellow">I'll kill that woman first.</font>

864

868
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,160
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

869
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:13,330
<font color="yellow">Is my face having a bad season?</font>

870
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,130
<font color="yellow">I had it all figured out.</font>

871
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,230
<font color="yellow">They never take this long to call me.</font>

872
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:19,430
<font color="yellow">Why hasn't he called me yet?</font>

873
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:22,200
<font color="yellow">The ring guy? That man?</font>

874
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:24,730

- I can't calm down.</font>

875
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,430
<font color="yellow">He's the most handsome man I have ever seen.</font>

879
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,530
<font color="yellow">- Just forget about him.
- How can I?</font>

880
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,330
<font color="yellow">He was the only guy I've met that wasn't considerate.</font>

881
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,730
<font color="yellow">That ring was so pretty.</font>

882
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,900
<font color="yellow">It was supposed to be mine.</font>

883
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,830
<font color="yellow">Do you have a pen?</font>

884
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:19,900
<font color="yellow">No. You can just tell me.</font>

885
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:22,730
<font color="yellow">That was funny.</font>

886
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,260
<font color="yellow">Are you good at memorizing numbers?</font>

887

01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,660
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

918
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:42,330
<font color="yellow">Give me your hands.</font>

919
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,360
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

920
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,400
<font color="yellow">Both hands.</font>

921
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:58,070
<font color="yellow">You're so thorough.</font>

922
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:01,600
<font color="yellow">This is why smart kids are scary.</font>

923
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak.</font>

924
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,200
<font color="yellow">I'm scared when kids like you do well in school.</font>

925
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:14,630
<font color="yellow">You act like you're kind and you make us feel sorry for you.</font>

926
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:16,330
<font color="yellow">However, it's all an act.</font>

927
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:19,260
<font color="yellow">It's people like you who taint our society.</font>

928
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:24,130
<font color="yellow">That's how good people end up getting wronged.</font>

929
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,030
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

930
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,360
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

931
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:50,860
<font color="yellow">Why are you drinking all of a sudden?</font>

932
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:54,960
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

933
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:57,930
<font color="yellow">It's never too sudden to drink.</font>

934
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,930
<font color="yellow">It's always better to have more alcohol, women, and meat.</font>

935
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,000
<font color="yellow">I was noble enough when I was a general.</font>

936
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,000
<font color="yellow">You were a general?</font>

937
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:10,230
<font color="yellow">Back in the days, you wouldn't dare talk to me.</font>

938
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:12,260
<font color="yellow">Come on, you don't even know who I was.</font>

939
01:14:12,830 --> 01:14:13,830
<font color="yellow">Who were you?</font>

940
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:20,430
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

941
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:22,400
<font color="yellow">What? Were you a king?</font>

942
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,630
<font color="yellow">Did you finish packing?</font>

943
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,600
<font color="yellow">That's what you meant?</font>

944
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:28,330
<font color="yellow">Well, I don't have much to pack.</font>

945
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,160
<font color="yellow">Have a safe trip.</font>

946
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,730
<font color="yellow">- I'll call you.
- I don't have a phone.</font>

947
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:37,830
<font color="yellow">That's why I said it.</font>

948
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:25,400
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? You're bothering me.</font>

949
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,660
<font color="yellow">Was a can of beer really enough for you to be like this?</font>

950
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:29,860
<font color="yellow">I don't know where she is.</font>

951
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,030
<font color="yellow">- Where who is?
- She won't summon me.</font>

952
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:34,360
<font color="yellow">She won't summon me, so I can't find her.</font>

953
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,630
<font color="yellow">I'm not the all-mighty, but there wasn't anything I couldn't do.</font>

954
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,430
<font color="yellow">I can't find that girl.</font>

955
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,160
<font color="yellow">All of my possessions are of no value to me.</font>

956
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,860
<font color="yellow">That's the truth.</font>

957
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:50,800
<font color="yellow">Your powers are only good for enjoying yourself.</font>

958
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,830
<font color="yellow">How did you find her before?</font>

959
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,570
<font color="yellow">I just did. Like this.</font>

960
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,300
<font color="yellow">Just call her.</font>

961
01:16:00,530 --> 01:16:01,800
<font color="yellow">She must have a phone, right?</font>

962
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,130
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

963
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,030
<font color="yellow">But I don't have her number.</font>

964
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,400
<font color="yellow">And I shouldn't anymore.</font>

965
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,070
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

966
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:53,360
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

967
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,230
<font color="yellow">How are you?</font>

968
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:01,500
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

969
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,300
<font color="yellow">Are you resting in peace?</font>

970
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,530
<font color="yellow">How is it like up there?</font>

971
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:14,230
<font color="yellow">Is it better than here?</font>

972
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:22,660
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm...</font>

973
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,330
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

974
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:33,960
<font color="yellow">I'm not well.</font>

975
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:41,530
<font color="yellow">Nobody asks me how I am.</font>

976
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:50,800
<font color="yellow">Again.</font>

977
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,960
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of it.</font>

978
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,530
<font color="yellow">My life is rainy.</font>

979
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:37,430
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm feeling down.</font>

980
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,230
<font color="yellow">What is?</font>

981
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
<font color="yellow">The rain.</font>

982
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:51,600
<font color="yellow">It'll stop soon.</font>

983
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,130
<font color="yellow">Does it rain when you feel down?</font>

984
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:57,800
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

985
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,400
<font color="yellow">How down do you have to be to make a typhoon?</font>

986
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:05,230
<font color="yellow">That's not me. It's the planet.</font>

987
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,130
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

988
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,160
<font color="yellow">The rain is stopping.</font>

989
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,500
<font color="yellow">I just started to feel better.</font>

990
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:31,700
<font color="yellow">I didn't summon you this time.</font>

991
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,630
<font color="yellow">No, you didn't.</font>

992
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,530
<font color="yellow">I've been busy, too. Doing this and that.</font>

993
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:41,600
<font color="yellow">I've been pretty occupied.</font>

994
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:45,860
<font color="yellow">This isn't good.</font>

995
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,800
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

996
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,230
<font color="yellow">Whenever it rains,</font>

997
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,100
<font color="yellow">I'll think you're feeling down from now on.</font>

998
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,900
<font color="yellow">It's not like I have anyone to rely on.</font>

999
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,830
<font color="yellow">I'll have to worry about you on top of that.</font>

1000
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,260
<font color="yellow">Aren't you cold? What are you doing out here?</font>

1001
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,760
<font color="yellow">Because I'm not happy.</font>

1002
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:13,030
<font color="yellow">It feels more like a cold now.</font>

1003
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,730
<font color="yellow">- What does?
- My series of misfortunes.</font>

1004
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,260
<font color="yellow">It comes back when I think I have forgotten about it.</font>

1005
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,860
<font color="yellow">When the time comes, I catch it again.</font>

1006
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,330
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying this to make you feel bad.</font>

1007
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,200
<font color="yellow">You didn't mean anything specific by that, did you?</font>

1008
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,360
<font color="yellow">Did I catch you off guard?</font>

1009
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:36,630
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

1010
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,760
<font color="yellow">That's the phrase I hate the most.</font>

1011
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,700
<font color="yellow">I picked the words correctly, then.</font>

1012
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,930
<font color="yellow">Continue your story.</font>

1013
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:57,100
<font color="yellow">It'll make you weep tears of sorrow.</font>

1014
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,960
<font color="yellow">I'll try to hold it in.</font>

1015
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,100
<font color="yellow">Have you heard the story?</font>

1016
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,260
<font color="yellow">Humans have four lives.</font>

1017
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:07,300
<font color="yellow">A life of planting seeds,</font>

1018
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:09,260
<font color="yellow">a life of watering the seeds,</font>

1019
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,300
<font color="yellow">a life of harvesting,</font>

1020
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,130
<font color="yellow">and a life of cherishing the harvests.</font>

1021
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,030
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

1022
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,700
<font color="yellow">That's what grim reapers say to the deceased.</font>

1023
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:21,300
<font color="yellow">I've been the goblin's bride for 19 years.</font>

1024
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:23,330
<font color="yellow">I've heard stories told by the ghosts.</font>

1025
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,400
<font color="yellow">I think it's unfair.</font>

1026
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,200
<font color="yellow">Why don't I get to...</font>

1027
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:31,070
<font color="yellow">the harvesting part in my life?</font>

1028
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,430
<font color="yellow">There's no progress.</font>

1029
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:38,900
<font color="yellow">My condolences.</font>

1030
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,800
<font color="yellow">- That's so formal.
- How should I do it, then?</font>

1031
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:44,300
<font color="yellow">There are so many choices.</font>

1032
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:46,630
<font color="yellow">You could pat my shoulder, brush my hair,</font>

1033
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,400
<font color="yellow">or give me 5,000 dollars.</font>

1034
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,600
<font color="yellow">Gosh. What about your hand?</font>

1035
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,400
<font color="yellow">My hands...</font>

1036
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,400
<font color="yellow">need to rest from working part-time too much.</font>

1037
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:57,530
<font color="yellow">I'm saving them for later...</font>

1038
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,070
<font color="yellow">in case someone hands me a handful of something.</font>

1039
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,070
<font color="yellow">Like what?</font>

1040
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,360
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

1041
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:13,800
<font color="yellow">My present for you.</font>

1042
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,400
<font color="yellow">It's pretty, isn't it?</font>

1043
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,300
<font color="yellow">- It's pretty.
- I know, right?</font>

1044
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:00,930
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

1045
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,730
<font color="yellow">I brushed your hair.</font>

1046
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:07,260
<font color="yellow">It was a farewell.</font>

1047
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,630
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving tomorrow.</font>

1048
01:23:35,654 --> 01:23:47,654
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU</font>

1049
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:49,660
<font color="yellow">Did you pack your things?</font>

1050
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,900
<font color="yellow">You asked me that already.</font>

1051
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,600
<font color="yellow">I want to keep reminding myself.</font>

1052
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:55,900
<font color="yellow">It makes me feel happy.</font>

1053
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,800
<font color="yellow">You got a text.</font>

1054
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,530
<font color="yellow">No. It was the bell.</font>

1055
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:04,000
<font color="yellow">That's the first time it rang in 60 years.</font>

1056
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,000
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1057
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:08,900
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1058
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,660
<font color="yellow">What did I just say?</font>

1059
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:19,530
<font color="yellow">The bell.</font>

1060
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,600
<font color="yellow">Nobody rings the bell.</font>

1061
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,960
<font color="yellow">Cut it out. You're scaring me.</font>

1062
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,160
<font color="yellow">- See through the wall.
- I can't do that.</font>

1063
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:30,400
<font color="yellow">What kind of grim reaper can't even see through walls?</font>

1064
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,400
<font color="yellow">You're one to talk.</font>

1065
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:43,330
<font color="yellow">Is this Mr. Goblin's house?</font>

1066
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:44,700
<font color="yellow">It's my house.</font>

1067
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,360
<font color="yellow">Did you come looking for me at my doorsteps?</font>

1068
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:48,960
<font color="yellow">Did you make an appointment with me?</font>

1069
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,700
<font color="yellow">I think I came to the wrong house.</font>

01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:58,860
<font color="yellow">Did you even tell her where you live?</font>

1071
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:04,800
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? How did you find this place?</font>

1072
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:09,000
<font color="yellow">I asked the ghosts where the goblin lives.</font>

1073
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,900
<font color="yellow">What's he doing here?</font>

1074
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:15,160
<font color="yellow">Your love spat's still ongoing. I hope you reach a happy conclusion.</font>

1075
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:17,300
<font color="yellow">I feel very uncomfortable.</font>

1076
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,230
<font color="yellow">- Do you live together?
- Just until today.</font>

1077
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,730
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

1078
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,930
<font color="yellow">To tell you something I didn't get to earlier.</font>

1079
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:32,160
<font color="yellow">You keep asking if I see something.</font>

1080
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:34,800
<font color="yellow">What if I see it?</font>

1081
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,200
<font color="yellow">- Why ask? You don't see it.
- Who says I don't?</font>

1082
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,960
<font color="yellow">One, if I see it, do we have to get married right away?</font>

1083
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,830
<font color="yellow">Two, if I see it, will you lend me 5,000 dollars?</font>

1084
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:49,330
<font color="yellow">Three, if I see it,</font>

1085
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,260
<font color="yellow">will you stay?</font>

1086
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,330
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

1087
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:04,360
<font color="yellow">Stay here in Korea.</font>

1088
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:08,730
<font color="yellow">Can't you?</font>

1089
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:14,860
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

1090
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,100
<font color="yellow">really see it?</font>

1091
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,510
<font color="yellow">- What if I do?
- Prove it.</font>

1092
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:22,080
<font color="yellow">I want an answer first.</font>

1093
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,240
<font color="yellow">Pick 1 of the 3 options.</font>

1094
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,340
<font color="yellow">You don't see it.</font>

1095
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,340
<font color="yellow">I really see it. I really do.</font>

1096
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:31,710
<font color="yellow">That sword.</font>

1097
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:30,610
<font color="yellow">(GOBLIN)</font>

1098
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:34,940
<font color="yellow">She sees the sword. She's my bride. I'm going to die.</font>

1099
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:38,210
<font color="yellow">Is she really my uncle's bride?</font>

1100
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,140
<font color="yellow">Why is she his bride?</font>

1101
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:41,580
<font color="yellow">It's a trick of fate.</font>

1102
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:44,240
<font color="yellow">It's a perfect house to raise a kid in.</font>

1103
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:47,680
<font color="yellow">Let's have a few kids and live happily.</font>

1104
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:51,080
<font color="yellow">Is this why they say marriage is a disaster?</font>

1105
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:53,110
<font color="yellow">Mister, is this our honeymoon?</font>

1106
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,940
<font color="yellow">Hello, how have you been?</font>

1107
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,010
<font color="yellow">I made up my mind.</font>

1108
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:01,840
<font color="yellow">I must disappear...</font>

1109
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:04,310
<font color="yellow">before I want to live for longer.</font>

1110
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:06,980
<font color="yellow">Before I feel happier.</font>

1111
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:11,840
<font color="yellow">This is something I must do for you.</font>

1112
01:28:13,410 --> 01:28:15,080
<font color="yellow">I must end this life.</font>

1113
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,480
<font color="yellow">You're the goblin's bride.</font>
