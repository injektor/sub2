<font color="yellow">(Episode 16)</font>

4
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:19,244
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because today is just about right.</font>

5
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:25,414
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because you are still shining.</font>

6
00:00:28,014 --> 00:00:32,344
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because you were that first love.</font>

7

<font color="yellow">On another day that is just about right,</font>

8

<font color="yellow">will you be my bride?</font>

9

<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

10
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:21,414
<font color="yellow">I will be the bride of this lonely man.</font>

11

<font color="yellow">I will be...</font>

12
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:29,374
<font color="yellow">the first and the last bride of this beautiful man.</font>

13
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,544
<font color="yellow">I most definitely will be.</font>

14
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:11,314
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

15
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:13,544
<font color="yellow">I'm getting married.</font>

16
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:16,614
<font color="yellow">I'll be happy.</font>

17
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:24,974
<font color="yellow">I see you met the goblin.</font>

18
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:27,714
<font color="yellow">And you're getting married.</font>

19
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,974
<font color="yellow">Good for you.</font>

20
00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:32,114
<font color="yellow">Why am I tearing up?</font>

21
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:34,974
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

22
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:40,444
<font color="yellow">- Do you see us? - Yes.</font>

23
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:43,174
<font color="yellow">How long has it been? How have you been?</font>

24
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:46,314
<font color="yellow">You finally see us again.</font>

25
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:47,714
<font color="yellow">You startled me.</font>

26
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:50,444
<font color="yellow">Have you been doing okay?</font>

27
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:52,474
<font color="yellow">We were lonely, that's all.</font>

28
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:55,474
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

29
00:02:56,374 --> 00:02:58,074
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you better than the goblin does.</font>

30

<font color="yellow">Wait here. I have a sack of salt somewhere to...</font>

31
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:06,244
<font color="yellow">You still have the same fiery temper.</font>

32
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:09,014
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

33
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,974
<font color="yellow">- You're getting married. - Congratulations.</font>

34
00:03:19,014 --> 00:03:20,144
<font color="yellow">Drink it.</font>

35
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:23,114
<font color="yellow">It'll remove your memories from your life.</font>

36
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,674
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

37
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:27,144
<font color="yellow">What kind of nonsense is this?</font>

38
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:29,314
<font color="yellow">I won't share a table with my driver.</font>

39
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:30,714
<font color="yellow">Or drink the same tea.</font>

40
00:03:30,714 --> 00:03:33,874
<font color="yellow">Here, everyone gets the same cup of tea.</font>

41
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:36,444
<font color="yellow">What logic is that? I'm upset as it is to be dead.</font>

42
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:38,944
<font color="yellow">Why should I be treated the same as...</font>

43
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:42,214
<font color="yellow">the likes of a man whose whole life isn't worth the watch on my wrist?</font>

44
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:44,074
<font color="yellow">I will tell you again.</font>

45
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,814
<font color="yellow">Here, everyone gets the same cup of tea.</font>

46
00:03:47,614 --> 00:03:50,244
<font color="yellow">Your watch has already stopped ticking.</font>

47
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:52,744
<font color="yellow">Nothing you have with you...</font>

48
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:55,944
<font color="yellow">can pass that threshold.</font>

49
00:03:58,074 --> 00:04:00,474
<font color="yellow">Were you a powerful man in this life?</font>

50
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:03,344
<font color="yellow">As soon as you go through that door, you'll realize that...</font>

51
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:07,174
<font color="yellow">the crimes you committed with your eyes, your mouth,</font>

52
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:09,144
<font color="yellow">your hands and feet...</font>

53
00:04:09,144 --> 00:04:13,074
<font color="yellow">and heart are much more powerful than anything you knew.</font>

54
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:18,314
<font color="yellow">See how deep in Hades they drag you down.</font>

55
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:39,374
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to go on a blind date?</font>

56
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:40,844
<font color="yellow">I don't like chefs.</font>

57
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:42,514
<font color="yellow">He isn't a chef.</font>

58
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:44,614
<font color="yellow">He's a client of mine.</font>

59
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:46,814
<font color="yellow">He's rich, owns a company,</font>

60
00:04:46,814 --> 00:04:49,744
<font color="yellow">is handsome and the crucial part is that...</font>

61
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,414
<font color="yellow">he's young.</font>

62
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:54,274
<font color="yellow">He likes older women.</font>

63
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:57,314
<font color="yellow">I consult him about inheritance issues,</font>

64
00:04:57,314 --> 00:04:59,684
<font color="yellow">not anything shady. What do you think?</font>

65
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:03,903
<font color="yellow">A blind date?</font>

66
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,974
<font color="yellow">Oh no. These are new.</font>

67
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:19,644
<font color="yellow">What just happened?</font>

68
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,176
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be waiting here.</font>

69
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:24,276
<font color="yellow">Ji Eun Tak!</font>

70
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:29,606
<font color="yellow">What should we listen to? A new singer's song?</font>

71
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:30,776
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

72
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:36,306
<font color="yellow">How can I help you?</font>

73
00:05:36,306 --> 00:05:38,476
<font color="yellow">I'm Producer Ji's boyfriend.</font>

74
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:41,676
<font color="yellow">- What? - Her fiance, to be exact.</font>

75
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,376
<font color="yellow">Shall we get hitched this weekend?</font>

76
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,306
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

77
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:48,476
<font color="yellow">Shall we get some lunch first? Let's get out of here.</font>

78
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:52,506
<font color="yellow">Is someone joining us?</font>

79
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:56,776
<font color="yellow">Deok Hwa. You should say hi.</font>

80
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:58,176
<font color="yellow">I guess.</font>

81
00:05:58,376 --> 00:06:01,336
<font color="yellow">What if he doesn't recognize me because I look so old?</font>

82
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:02,936
<font color="yellow">That will never happen.</font>

83
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:05,076
<font color="yellow">Can I have some soup, please?</font>

84
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:06,236
<font color="yellow">- Sure. - He's here.</font>

85
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:18,206
<font color="yellow">An official-looking feast in front of...</font>

86
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:19,836
<font color="yellow">a couple sitting side-by-side.</font>

87
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:23,176
<font color="yellow">- I got what's going on. - Yes.</font>

88
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:25,206
<font color="yellow">We're engaged.</font>

89
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,336
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

90
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:29,406
<font color="yellow">Saturday or Sunday?</font>

91
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,406
<font color="yellow">What got into you today?</font>

92
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:33,236
<font color="yellow">Lunchtime or dinnertime?</font>

93
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:35,806
<font color="yellow">I prefer Sunday evening. Saturday's my night out.</font>

94
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:38,376
<font color="yellow">What's this about?</font>

95
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:41,276
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell? It's to stop you from going on blind dates.</font>

96
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,936
<font color="yellow">With a handsome rich guy...</font>

97
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,776
<font color="yellow">who is younger than you.</font>

98
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:46,506
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

99
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,236
<font color="yellow">I'm the only one in Korea who fits that description.</font>

100
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:52,406
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. You aren't my type.</font>

101
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:56,476
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you. I am Yu Deok Hwa.</font>

102
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:58,636
<font color="yellow">Hello, I heard a lot about you.</font>

103
00:06:58,636 --> 00:07:00,476
<font color="yellow">I am Ji Eun Tak.</font>

104
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:03,036
<font color="yellow">He got promoted to manager.</font>

105
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:04,506
<font color="yellow">Ji Eun Tak?</font>

106
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:06,406
<font color="yellow">The Ji Eun Tak of that old letter?</font>

107
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:08,336
<font color="yellow">The Ji Eun Tak who knows my tenant?</font>

108
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:10,936
<font color="yellow">There's still a lot you don't know.</font>

109
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,306
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy your soup. - Thanks, I will.</font>

110
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:19,636
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

111
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:22,106
<font color="yellow">do you know what my uncle is?</font>

112
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:25,406
<font color="yellow">He's a goblin. Doesn't everyone know one of those?</font>

113
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:27,306
<font color="yellow">- Correct. - No way.</font>

114
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:30,476
<font color="yellow">You know about my building and my uncle.</font>

115
00:07:30,676 --> 00:07:33,506
<font color="yellow">What's going on? Why am I the only one in the dark?</font>

116
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:34,606
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

117
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:37,306
<font color="yellow">Eat up and grow up.</font>

118
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:39,036
<font color="yellow">You'll find out in due time.</font>

119
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:42,606
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

120
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:49,836
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare go on a blind date.</font>

121
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,976
<font color="yellow">Why would I? I'll be a married woman soon.</font>

122
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:58,276
<font color="yellow">She said "married woman".</font>

123
00:07:58,576 --> 00:07:59,936
<font color="yellow">Where do you live?</font>

124
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,976
<font color="yellow">I said you aren't my type.</font>

125
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:05,276
<font color="yellow">Do you like your job?</font>

126
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,936
<font color="yellow">My uncle's getting married.</font>

127
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:09,006
<font color="yellow">That's great news.</font>

128
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:11,976
<font color="yellow">It is. I want to get married before he does.</font>

129
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:13,676
<font color="yellow">That's even greater news.</font>

130
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:15,806
<font color="yellow">Isn't it? I'll have lots of kids...</font>

131
00:08:15,806 --> 00:08:17,236
<font color="yellow">so that no one's lonely.</font>

132
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:19,736
<font color="yellow">I could wish for nothing more.</font>

133
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:21,236
<font color="yellow">But Deok Hwa.</font>

134
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:23,906
<font color="yellow">You need a partner to get married.</font>

135
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:25,736
<font color="yellow">I have lots of women.</font>

136
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:29,136
<font color="yellow">Yes, and that's the problem. You can't have many women.</font>

137
00:08:32,706 --> 00:08:36,006
<font color="yellow">Was there anyone who made your heart pound?</font>

138
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:39,246
<font color="yellow">Anyone you missed to the point of wanting to cry?</font>

139
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:42,876
<font color="yellow">Was there anyone who made you think you'd be willing to...</font>

140
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:45,006
<font color="yellow">die for that person?</font>

141
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:47,776
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

142
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:52,006
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to get married?</font>

143
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:54,836
<font color="yellow">- I don't. - Why not?</font>

144
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:56,606
<font color="yellow">I'm already married with three kids.</font>

145
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:58,276
<font color="yellow">I married such a person.</font>

146
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:00,476
<font color="yellow">No way. Did you really?</font>

147
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:02,706
<font color="yellow">- Why didn't I know that? - I never told you.</font>

148
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:05,306
<font color="yellow">- Why didn't you tell me? - You never asked.</font>

149
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:09,576
<font color="yellow">You don't care much about...</font>

150
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:12,776
<font color="yellow">the people around you or how the world works.</font>

151
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,606
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm waiting for you to ask questions.</font>

152
00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:18,006
<font color="yellow">Questions that an adult would ask.</font>

153
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:20,906
<font color="yellow">About the world...</font>

154
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:25,036
<font color="yellow">and about the joy and sorrows of those around you.</font>

155
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:31,476
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

156
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:34,876
<font color="yellow">Give me a little more time.</font>

157
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:38,246
<font color="yellow">I'll try my best to grow up.</font>

158
00:09:39,076 --> 00:09:40,376
<font color="yellow">You do that.</font>

159
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:50,476
<font color="yellow">How could you just come out and tell everyone...</font>

160
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:52,246
<font color="yellow">without my permission?</font>

161
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:54,336
<font color="yellow">Eyes on the road. A car's coming.</font>

162
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:55,606
<font color="yellow">Watch out.</font>

163
00:09:56,336 --> 00:09:57,506
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid?</font>

164
00:09:57,506 --> 00:10:00,036
<font color="yellow">No. Watching you drive makes me think...</font>

165
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:02,076
<font color="yellow">you're all grown up. Stay in your lane.</font>

166
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:04,506
<font color="yellow">- Keep your hands on the wheel. - I am.</font>

167
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:07,636
<font color="yellow">I know you are, I just find it fascinating, that's all.</font>

168
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:09,306
<font color="yellow">I've never been a passenger before.</font>

169
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:12,976
<font color="yellow">- Turn left here. - Left?</font>

170
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:15,676
<font color="yellow">Not right, left, left!</font>

171
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:20,106
<font color="yellow">Stop yelling. Where are we going anyway?</font>

172
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:23,776
<font color="yellow">Turn on the blinkers before you make a turn!</font>

173
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:51,906
<font color="yellow">You look so pretty.</font>

174
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:57,476
<font color="yellow">You look pretty nice yourself.</font>

175
00:10:57,636 --> 00:10:59,576
<font color="yellow">I always do.</font>

176
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:06,176
<font color="yellow">Let's get married with a bowl of water.</font>

177
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:07,776
<font color="yellow">Keep it mysterious.</font>

178
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:09,636
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

179
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:21,006
<font color="yellow">Is it a gift?</font>

180
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:22,976
<font color="yellow">A wedding gift.</font>

181
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:27,336
<font color="yellow">He has pretty wrists.</font>

182
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:29,106
<font color="yellow">I'll take this one.</font>

183
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:14,076
<font color="yellow">I love all the roads we will walk together.</font>

184
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:16,506
<font color="yellow">I love all the sceneries we will see together.</font>

185
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:18,876
<font color="yellow">I love all the questions we will shyly ask each other...</font>

186
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:21,776
<font color="yellow">and all the answers to those questions.</font>

187
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:23,936
<font color="yellow">I love you...</font>

188
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:27,476
<font color="yellow">in all those moments. From your bride.</font>

189
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:31,306
<font color="yellow">After we listen to a song, we will come back with a listener's story.</font>

190
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:32,336
<font color="yellow">Cue.</font>

191
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:35,236
<font color="yellow">What is this letter?</font>

192
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:37,176
<font color="yellow">It's so poorly written.</font>

193
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:39,506
<font color="yellow">Was this written at night?</font>

194
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:41,876
<font color="yellow">What is it? I love love letters.</font>

195
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:43,506
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you do.</font>

196
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:46,406
<font color="yellow">"To the one who thought..."</font>

197
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:48,776
<font color="yellow">"that oblivion would bring me peace of mind."</font>

198
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:51,336
<font color="yellow">"The moment our eyes met, I knew..."</font>

199
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:54,276
<font color="yellow">"that you too retained your memories."</font>

200
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:56,306
<font color="yellow">Pick this story. It's my right as the producer.</font>

201
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:57,506
<font color="yellow">I'll be back soon.</font>

202
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:59,476
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak! Hey!</font>

203
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:01,376
<font color="yellow">This is a live show!</font>

204
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,036
<font color="yellow">"I pray that in our next life..."</font>

205
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:08,806
<font color="yellow">"The wait will be short and the meeting shall be long."</font>

206
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:13,006
<font color="yellow">"That we won't need an excuse to see each other."</font>

207
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:17,936
<font color="yellow">"Entitled with our own dearest names."</font>

208
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:22,506
<font color="yellow">"So we could greet each other..."</font>

209
00:13:22,606 --> 00:13:24,936
<font color="yellow">"when we accidentally run into each other."</font>

210
00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:28,576
<font color="yellow">With our love always being the solution.</font>

211
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,976
<font color="yellow">I pray that we can meet like that.</font>

212
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:35,776
<font color="yellow">I'm just happy that I saw your face.</font>

213
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:38,676
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, you're Kim Woo Bin.</font>

214
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:42,576
<font color="yellow">And sometimes, you're Wang Yeo.</font>

215
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:45,406
<font color="yellow">Please live a long...</font>

216
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:47,436
<font color="yellow">and happy life.</font>

217
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:51,636
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

218
00:13:52,776 --> 00:13:56,306
<font color="yellow">Did she really sell the building? Didn't she just move?</font>

219
00:13:56,306 --> 00:13:59,576
<font color="yellow">No. She sold the building last week. You live on the rooftop, right?</font>

220
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:02,176
<font color="yellow">You're my tenant now.</font>

221
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:04,106
<font color="yellow">I heard you work for a radio station.</font>

222
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:06,036
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

223
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:09,136
<font color="yellow">I'm in a little bit of a hurry right now. I'll see you later.</font>

224
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:13,606
<font color="yellow">(The rooftop unit)</font>

225
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:24,506
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak.</font>

226
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:26,176
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

227
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:28,736
<font color="yellow">Take care. Don't cry.</font>

228
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,276
<font color="yellow">Get something to eat.</font>

229
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:35,006
<font color="yellow">You were all alone without a family.</font>

230
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:37,706
<font color="yellow">I hope I provided you a little bit of comfort.</font>

231
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:40,776
<font color="yellow">Please take good care of my stubborn brother.</font>

232
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:43,036
<font color="yellow">Stay happy together.</font>

233
00:14:43,376 --> 00:14:44,636
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

234
00:14:48,676 --> 00:14:51,036
<font color="yellow">She remembered everything.</font>

235
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,136
<font color="yellow">Sunny...</font>

236
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:00,836
<font color="yellow">left.</font>

237
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:05,606
<font color="yellow">She remembered everything.</font>

238
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:08,236
<font color="yellow">She kept the memory alone.</font>

239
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,636
<font color="yellow">She took care of me when I didn't remember anything.</font>

240
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,206
<font color="yellow">She missed her brother who disappeared.</font>

241
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:15,506
<font color="yellow">She must've been so lonely.</font>

242
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:20,336
<font color="yellow">Why did she leave now?</font>

243
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:22,606
<font color="yellow">It's because she can't forgive him.</font>

244
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:25,606
<font color="yellow">She made the choice...</font>

245
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,306
<font color="yellow">not to see him again in this life.</font>

246
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:32,676
<font color="yellow">There's no bigger punishment...</font>

247
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:35,706
<font color="yellow">for the Grim Reaper.</font>

248
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:54,436
<font color="yellow">I should count to 50 and leave.</font>

249
00:15:55,976 --> 00:15:57,236
<font color="yellow">One.</font>

250
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:01,776
<font color="yellow">Two.</font>

251
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:07,376
<font color="yellow">47.</font>

252
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:09,976
<font color="yellow">48.</font>

253
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,006
<font color="yellow">49.</font>

254
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,560
<font color="yellow">One.</font>

255
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:34,965
<font color="yellow">Two.</font>

256
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,645
<font color="yellow">Three.</font>

257
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:46,736
<font color="yellow">You will...</font>

258
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:49,906
<font color="yellow">not hear from me.</font>

259
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:55,876
<font color="yellow">In this life,</font>

260
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:01,436
<font color="yellow">we will never meet again.</font>

261
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:07,806
<font color="yellow">Can I...</font>

262
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:11,006
<font color="yellow">hug you just once?</font>

263
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:47,976
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

264
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,376
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

265
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:00,176
<font color="yellow">Like that,</font>

266
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:03,946
<font color="yellow">we parted in this life.</font>

267
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:08,606
<font color="yellow">It was...</font>

268
00:18:09,776 --> 00:18:11,276
<font color="yellow">much later...</font>

269
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:13,376
<font color="yellow">when I heard from her.</font>

270
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:45,206
<font color="yellow">I touched this vulgar thing for you.</font>

271
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:47,136
<font color="yellow">Why don't you try it?</font>

272
00:18:49,206 --> 00:18:52,206
<font color="yellow">The apples look like bunnies.</font>

273
00:18:55,976 --> 00:18:57,606
<font color="yellow">Sunny...</font>

274
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:00,506
<font color="yellow">left.</font>

275
00:19:02,306 --> 00:19:03,676
<font color="yellow">She is...</font>

276
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:05,976
<font color="yellow">always...</font>

277
00:19:06,476 --> 00:19:07,906
<font color="yellow">so good...</font>

278
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:10,776
<font color="yellow">at leaving.</font>

279
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:17,776
<font color="yellow">After what happened to you,</font>

280
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:21,176
<font color="yellow">I didn't know what to do, so I kept it.</font>

281
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:23,946
<font color="yellow">I meant to return it to you much sooner.</font>

282
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:28,676
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry it's late.</font>

283
00:19:30,106 --> 00:19:32,276
<font color="yellow">It wasn't mine from the start.</font>

284
00:19:33,276 --> 00:19:36,036
<font color="yellow">It was your resentment, sin, and longing.</font>

285
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,236
<font color="yellow">I think you should keep it.</font>

286
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:40,946
<font color="yellow">Can I keep it?</font>

287
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:42,506
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

288
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,376
<font color="yellow">If you eat this.</font>

289
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:51,176
<font color="yellow">And thank you.</font>

290
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:55,206
<font color="yellow">I heard you lit the candles...</font>

291
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:59,506
<font color="yellow">at the temple while I was gone for the past nine years.</font>

292
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:04,176
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I had the rights to pay respects to them.</font>

293
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:08,076
<font color="yellow">But I wanted to face my sins.</font>

294
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:12,336
<font color="yellow">I wish someone could tell us.</font>

295
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:15,836
<font color="yellow">"You've done enough."</font>

296
00:20:17,236 --> 00:20:19,036
<font color="yellow">"It's time to end it all."</font>

297
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,006
<font color="yellow">I'd like that.</font>

298
00:20:35,576 --> 00:20:38,336
<font color="yellow">I heard you wanted to see me.</font>

299
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:40,576
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

300
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:42,976
<font color="yellow">I want...</font>

301
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,236
<font color="yellow">to tell you a secret.</font>

302
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:49,136
<font color="yellow">A secret?</font>

303
00:20:50,976 --> 00:20:54,976
<font color="yellow">You become a grim reaper if you commit a sin in your past life.</font>

304
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:58,036
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell you what your sin was.</font>

305
00:21:01,976 --> 00:21:03,906
<font color="yellow">The big sin we committed...</font>

306
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:06,876
<font color="yellow">was taking our own lives.</font>

307
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,076
<font color="yellow">Those who took their own lives...</font>

308
00:21:10,576 --> 00:21:12,706
<font color="yellow">are born again as grim reapers,</font>

309
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:16,236
<font color="yellow">made to guide many deaths,</font>

310
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,806
<font color="yellow">and live as a being that's in between the living and the dead.</font>

311
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:23,106
<font color="yellow">What do you think is the reason for this?</font>

312
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:26,176
<font color="yellow">Why do you think someone without a name...</font>

313
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:28,236
<font color="yellow">or any memories...</font>

314
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:31,906
<font color="yellow">needs a house...</font>

315
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:35,106
<font color="yellow">and food?</font>

316
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:37,206
<font color="yellow">What do you think is the reason?</font>

317
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:40,376
<font color="yellow">While looking for the answer to those questions,</font>

318
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:42,236
<font color="yellow">I realized one day...</font>

319
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:45,336
<font color="yellow">that maybe it makes us...</font>

320
00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:47,306
<font color="yellow">yearn for a name...</font>

321
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:49,676
<font color="yellow">and the life...</font>

322
00:21:50,236 --> 00:21:52,406
<font color="yellow">we had once abandoned.</font>

323
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:57,636
<font color="yellow">Maybe this punishment ends...</font>

324
00:21:57,736 --> 00:22:00,076
<font color="yellow">when we become desperate for life.</font>

325
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:06,906
<font color="yellow">I know why you avoided me.</font>

326
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:09,136
<font color="yellow">I assume...</font>

327
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:12,676
<font color="yellow">you met Park Joong Heon nine years ago.</font>

328
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:15,636
<font color="yellow">That means you know...</font>

329
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:19,236
<font color="yellow">who you are and who I am.</font>

330
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:21,406
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

331
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:25,576
<font color="yellow">I wanted to apologize.</font>

332
00:22:26,036 --> 00:22:28,176
<font color="yellow">I should not have chosen death...</font>

333
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:30,906
<font color="yellow">by borrowing your hands as I did.</font>

334
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:32,506
<font color="yellow">I regret it.</font>

335
00:22:32,806 --> 00:22:34,006
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

336
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:36,976
<font color="yellow">I beg for your forgiveness.</font>

337
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:51,176
<font color="yellow">So forget everything.</font>

338
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:53,176
<font color="yellow">Forget from now on.</font>

339
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,306
<font color="yellow">Send off the deceased souls during their final moments.</font>

340
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,006
<font color="yellow">Make penance like that.</font>

341
00:22:59,506 --> 00:23:01,206
<font color="yellow">I hope you will...</font>

342
00:23:03,106 --> 00:23:05,236
<font color="yellow">come to forgive yourself as well.</font>

343
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:08,906
<font color="yellow">What the deity wants of us...</font>

344
00:23:09,076 --> 00:23:13,776
<font color="yellow">is probably to forgive ourselves and realize the earnestness of life.</font>

345
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:32,876
<font color="yellow">Come eat.</font>

346
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:35,476
<font color="yellow">Where are you going so late at night?</font>

347
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:38,436
<font color="yellow">The soup will get cold. Eat.</font>

348
00:23:39,006 --> 00:23:40,736
<font color="yellow">Do you have a boyfriend?</font>

349
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:45,036
<font color="yellow">I hope you don't end up being a single mom like your mom.</font>

350
00:23:46,906 --> 00:23:48,676
<font color="yellow">Why must you always...</font>

351
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:52,776
<font color="yellow">How long are you staying?</font>

352
00:23:53,676 --> 00:23:55,576
<font color="yellow">I gave you enough memorial foods.</font>

353
00:23:55,806 --> 00:23:58,806
<font color="yellow">You're a ghost. It isn't good to roam for too long.</font>

354
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:00,976
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk to me like that?</font>

355
00:24:01,236 --> 00:24:02,436
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

356
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:06,576
<font color="yellow">I can't just go like this. It's not fair.</font>

357
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:11,406
<font color="yellow">If only I had those bank books. If only you hadn't stolen them,</font>

358
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:14,376
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have died on the streets!</font>

359
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:22,606
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

360
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:25,706
<font color="yellow">Must you do this even after you die?</font>

361
00:24:26,206 --> 00:24:30,176
<font color="yellow">You're talking back because you haven't been hit in a while.</font>

362
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:31,276
<font color="yellow">Why I...</font>

363
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:35,406
<font color="yellow">Hey, lady. Whom do you think you're trying to touch?</font>

364
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:39,776
<font color="yellow">She's someone I cherish dearly. Shall I break your wrist?</font>

365
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:42,806
<font color="yellow">What's your problem? Who is this psycho?</font>

366
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,406
<font color="yellow">I'm your senior by years, and what? A psycho?</font>

367
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:50,236
<font color="yellow">You know what? You need to come with me.</font>

368
00:24:50,436 --> 00:24:53,406
<font color="yellow">Go with me. It's because I'm lonely.</font>

369
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:58,476
<font color="yellow">I tend to get along well with evil witches.</font>

370
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,806
<font color="yellow">Let go. Let go of me!</font>

371
00:25:02,076 --> 00:25:03,676
<font color="yellow">- Do you know her? - Hey!</font>

372
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:06,276
<font color="yellow">I think I've finally found my companion.</font>

373
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:09,806
<font color="yellow">She'll be a good sparring partner for the lonely afterlife.</font>

374
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:12,576
<font color="yellow">You're leaving?</font>

375
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:16,206
<font color="yellow">It's time.</font>

376
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:19,406
<font color="yellow">Thanks for everything.</font>

377
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:22,906
<font color="yellow">Live happily ever after with the goblin.</font>

378
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:27,076
<font color="yellow">Come on. Let's go.</font>

379
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:28,576
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

380
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:34,906
<font color="yellow">Auntie. Thank you for raising me.</font>

381
00:25:35,206 --> 00:25:39,276
<font color="yellow">In our next lifetime, let's meet on good terms.</font>

382
00:25:40,376 --> 00:25:42,476
<font color="yellow">Don't make me laugh! Why would I meet you again?</font>

383
00:25:42,476 --> 00:25:45,106
<font color="yellow">Let go! Let go!</font>

384
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,506
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

385
00:25:46,676 --> 00:25:49,636
<font color="yellow">Let go! Let go!</font>

386
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:07,076
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

387
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:12,206
<font color="yellow">You're still doing that alone. Where's the goblin?</font>

388
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:14,706
<font color="yellow">I don't know. He said something about drawing fresh water.</font>

389
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:17,976
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who wanted to see you.</font>

390
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,336
<font color="yellow">I have something for you.</font>

391
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:21,776
<font color="yellow">Did you get...</font>

392
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:25,106
<font color="yellow">my name card?</font>

393
00:26:28,936 --> 00:26:30,876
<font color="yellow">No, it's not like that.</font>

394
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:34,876
<font color="yellow">I see. You scared me.</font>

395
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:38,476
<font color="yellow">Are you worried that your name will come up?</font>

396
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:41,106
<font color="yellow">Not really worried. I'm curious...</font>

397
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:44,506
<font color="yellow">about how my fate has changed.</font>

398
00:26:46,176 --> 00:26:49,176
<font color="yellow">Your fate has so many variables.</font>

399
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,076
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

400
00:26:52,106 --> 00:26:55,476
<font color="yellow">The birthmark is gone and I pulled out the sword.</font>

401
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:59,406
<font color="yellow">So I've been living without problems for the past nine years.</font>

402
00:27:00,606 --> 00:27:05,476
<font color="yellow">But it doesn't change the fact that I'm a missing soul.</font>

403
00:27:06,406 --> 00:27:08,706
<font color="yellow">I was almost never born.</font>

404
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:12,476
<font color="yellow">I drove the person I love to death.</font>

405
00:27:13,436 --> 00:27:14,506
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

406
00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:18,906
<font color="yellow">the person before me is a grim reaper.</font>

407
00:27:19,876 --> 00:27:24,376
<font color="yellow">Above all else, every human dies at some point.</font>

408
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:27,706
<font color="yellow">That's why life is even more beautiful.</font>

409
00:27:31,076 --> 00:27:32,106
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

410
00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:35,206
<font color="yellow">the first thought I had once I got my memory back...</font>

411
00:27:36,036 --> 00:27:39,436
<font color="yellow">was to live each day as if it were my last.</font>

412
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:44,306
<font color="yellow">If today is my last day, this will be...</font>

413
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:47,276
<font color="yellow">my final memory of the person I love.</font>

414
00:27:49,476 --> 00:27:51,236
<font color="yellow">So I'd better...</font>

415
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:54,076
<font color="yellow">live hard and love.</font>

416
00:27:54,336 --> 00:27:55,636
<font color="yellow">That's what I told myself.</font>

417
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:59,876
<font color="yellow">Your life is already beautiful. Just know that.</font>

418
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:05,276
<font color="yellow">What did you want to give me?</font>

419
00:28:08,306 --> 00:28:09,376
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

420
00:28:20,976 --> 00:28:23,876
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on your wedding, Goblin's bride.</font>

421
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:27,276
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

422
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:49,906
<font color="yellow">Until death parts us,</font>

423
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:53,336
<font color="yellow">every word that you say,</font>

424
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:55,836
<font color="yellow">whatever it may be,</font>

425
00:28:58,506 --> 00:28:59,706
<font color="yellow">me too.</font>

426
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:02,406
<font color="yellow">Until death parts us,</font>

427
00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:06,676
<font color="yellow">every word that you say, whatever it may be,</font>

428
00:29:07,176 --> 00:29:08,506
<font color="yellow">me too.</font>

429
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:19,506
<font color="yellow">- That looks good. - This?</font>

430
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:21,376
<font color="yellow">Should we make more?</font>

431
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:29,236
<font color="yellow">Champagne is best between 7 and 8ºC.</font>

432
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:34,906
<font color="yellow">Uncle Tenant.</font>

433
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,706
<font color="yellow">I feel drunk already, and I haven't even drunk yet.</font>

434
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:42,776
<font color="yellow">You can't get drunk already.</font>

435
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,806
<font color="yellow">- Bottoms up. - Not you, too.</font>

436
00:30:00,976 --> 00:30:02,206
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

437
00:30:02,406 --> 00:30:04,906
<font color="yellow">- You don't look well. - I'm fine.</font>

438
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:08,436
<font color="yellow">Okay. I made it 7ºC.</font>

439
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,776
<font color="yellow">Would you like a glass?</font>

440
00:30:11,206 --> 00:30:12,936
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you...</font>

441
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:16,836
<font color="yellow">- Oh no. - Mr. Kim.</font>

442
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:17,906
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

443
00:30:17,906 --> 00:30:19,876
<font color="yellow">Can't you guys be more careful?</font>

444
00:30:19,976 --> 00:30:22,576
<font color="yellow">Both of you are too careless and relaxed.</font>

445
00:30:26,176 --> 00:30:28,506
<font color="yellow">What was that? How did that come out so naturally?</font>

446
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:33,636
<font color="yellow">Sing. Sing.</font>

447
00:30:34,936 --> 00:30:36,706
<font color="yellow">Sing.</font>

448
00:30:36,736 --> 00:30:39,076
<font color="yellow">No, no. I can't sing.</font>

449
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:40,306
<font color="yellow">I can't sing.</font>

450
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:42,236
<font color="yellow">Meeting you.</font>

451
00:30:42,706 --> 00:30:45,906
<font color="yellow">Among all these people.</font>

452
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:48,206
<font color="yellow">Was.</font>

453
00:30:48,506 --> 00:30:51,776
<font color="yellow">Really lucky.</font>

454
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,706
<font color="yellow">Meeting you.</font>

455
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:58,606
<font color="yellow">In this big world.</font>

456
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,876
<font color="yellow">All together, now.</font>

457
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:05,306
<font color="yellow">Meeting you was happiness for me.</font>

458
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:13,036
<font color="yellow">Meeting you among all these people</font>

459
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sleepy.</font>

460
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,939
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

461
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:31,239
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

462
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:54,958
<font color="yellow">This is our last song. I wish you happiness.</font>

463
00:31:57,128 --> 00:31:59,158
<font color="yellow">Okay, good job.</font>

464
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:00,941
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

465
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,728
<font color="yellow">Today's show was so great.</font>

466
00:32:04,728 --> 00:32:07,328
<font color="yellow">You were right on time and the set list was perfect.</font>

467
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:09,328
<font color="yellow">Our bulletin board is receiving a lot of good feedback.</font>

468
00:32:09,588 --> 00:32:10,858
<font color="yellow">It's rare to have such a perfect show.</font>

469
00:32:10,858 --> 00:32:14,028
<font color="yellow">Stop flattering me.</font>

470
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:17,628
<font color="yellow">Then I'm going to go meet with a guest,</font>

471
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:18,658
<font color="yellow">then go straight home from there.</font>

472
00:32:18,658 --> 00:32:20,058
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

473
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:21,988
<font color="yellow">- Goodnight. - See you tomorrow.</font>

474
00:32:41,988 --> 00:32:45,758

00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:54,588
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

477
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:58,388

484
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,858
<font color="yellow">Why would it change, though?</font>

485
00:34:04,528 --> 00:34:06,328
<font color="yellow">Because of a death...</font>

486
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:09,188
<font color="yellow">where a list cannot be made.</font>

487
00:34:09,188 --> 00:34:12,388
<font color="yellow">Can there be a death without a name list?</font>

488
00:34:12,728 --> 00:34:14,088
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

489
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:20,528

494
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:38,358
<font color="yellow">It's 4pm. I'm on my way to a meeting.</font>

495

<font color="yellow">Hold on. Let me turn right first.</font>

496
00:34:42,128 --> 00:34:44,188

<font color="yellow">(Bride)</font>

<font color="yellow">In loving memory of...</font>

<font color="yellow">beloved goblin's bride.</font>

631
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:55,128
<font color="yellow">May she rest in peace.</font>

632
00:47:06,588 --> 00:47:07,588
<font color="yellow">(In loving memory of beloved goblin's bride.)</font>

633
00:47:07,588 --> 00:47:08,758
<font color="yellow">(May she rest in peace.)</font>

634
00:47:19,828 --> 00:47:21,888
<font color="yellow">(Beloved, bride, rest in peace)</font>

635
00:47:55,658 --> 00:47:57,488
<font color="yellow">That day,</font>

636
00:47:58,258 --> 00:48:00,358
<font color="yellow">Missing Soul walked through...</font>

637
00:48:00,558 --> 00:48:02,228
<font color="yellow">the tears of someone.</font>

638
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:07,758
<font color="yellow">Tides of time got carried away...</font>

639
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:10,428
<font color="yellow">by the rainfall.</font>

640
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,258
<font color="yellow">It was...</font>

641
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:15,228
<font color="yellow">a very long rain.</font>

642
00:48:17,788 --> 00:48:19,288
<font color="yellow">Missing Soul...</font>

643
00:48:19,588 --> 00:48:22,158
<font color="yellow">left this world without a guardian...</font>

644
00:48:22,788 --> 00:48:25,828
<font color="yellow">after leaving one behind.</font>

645
00:48:27,828 --> 00:48:31,658
<font color="yellow">A very lonely and beautiful guardian.</font>

646
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:42,328
<font color="yellow">She must have...</font>

647
00:48:42,788 --> 00:48:44,258
<font color="yellow">met her mom by now.</font>

648
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,428
<font color="yellow">What is that hairpin?</font>

649
00:48:54,988 --> 00:48:56,988
<font color="yellow">You didn't pay for that, did you?</font>

650
00:48:56,988 --> 00:48:58,958
<font color="yellow">No, this is of my dad's taste.</font>

651
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:01,588
<font color="yellow">Then wear it when he's around. Why do you have it on now?</font>

652
00:49:01,588 --> 00:49:05,088
<font color="yellow">I love my dad whether he's around or not.</font>

653
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:07,058
<font color="yellow">So mind your own business and shut your mouth.</font>

654
00:49:08,558 --> 00:49:11,088
<font color="yellow">I don't even have a dad who can buy me one of those.</font>

655
00:49:11,188 --> 00:49:12,528
<font color="yellow">I don't get it.</font>

656
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:15,758
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why do you have to get all serious?</font>

657
00:49:18,728 --> 00:49:20,558
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at, Lady?</font>

658
00:49:23,288 --> 00:49:25,358
<font color="yellow">Kids these days are scary.</font>

659
00:49:26,028 --> 00:49:27,228
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

660
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:31,558
<font color="yellow">Sweetheart.</font>

661
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:35,158
<font color="yellow">I know you can be like that at your age,</font>

662
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:38,988
<font color="yellow">but you don't have to be.</font>

663
00:49:38,988 --> 00:49:41,128
<font color="yellow">I was only looking at you...</font>

664
00:49:41,128 --> 00:49:44,388
<font color="yellow">because I couldn't believe how precious you are.</font>

665
00:49:46,028 --> 00:49:47,458
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

666
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:48,988
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

667
00:49:53,188 --> 00:49:54,358
<font color="yellow">Do you want more fish cake?</font>

668
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,458
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Yes.</font>

669
00:50:04,758 --> 00:50:07,858
<font color="yellow">First loves never work out.</font>

670
00:50:09,128 --> 00:50:10,858
<font color="yellow">You must've loved her a lot.</font>

671
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:12,558
<font color="yellow">I guess I did,</font>

672
00:50:13,088 --> 00:50:14,988
<font color="yellow">considering I can't hold back.</font>

673
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:23,988
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

674
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:27,728
<font color="yellow">I missed you so much that I couldn't breathe.</font>

675
00:50:27,888 --> 00:50:29,528
<font color="yellow">It was too dangerous.</font>

676
00:50:46,488 --> 00:50:48,458
<font color="yellow">The woman forgot about you,</font>

677
00:50:48,658 --> 00:50:51,088
<font color="yellow">but you didn't forget her.</font>

678
00:50:52,388 --> 00:50:53,458
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

679
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:56,588
<font color="yellow">Never for a second or a day.</font>

680
00:51:01,088 --> 00:51:02,728
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

681
00:51:06,528 --> 00:51:09,888
<font color="yellow">you're not supposed to press my head like that.</font>

682
00:51:16,128 --> 00:51:19,288
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to pat it like this.</font>

683
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:50,828
<font color="yellow">(30 years later)</font>

684
00:52:23,988 --> 00:52:26,858
<font color="yellow">It's your final name card.</font>

685
00:52:27,488 --> 00:52:31,888
<font color="yellow">Your long punishment has come to an end.</font>

686
00:52:40,058 --> 00:52:41,428
<font color="yellow">Is it just one?</font>

687
00:52:42,288 --> 00:52:43,528
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

688
00:52:47,158 --> 00:52:51,358
<font color="yellow">Finally, it's the end of my long punishment.</font>

689
00:52:52,058 --> 00:52:53,658
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

690
00:52:54,188 --> 00:52:55,458
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

691
00:52:57,188 --> 00:52:58,558
<font color="yellow">go in peace.</font>

692
00:53:06,588 --> 00:53:08,328
<font color="yellow">You've helped me a lot.</font>

693
00:53:10,328 --> 00:53:11,788
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

694
00:53:44,658 --> 00:53:46,858
<font color="yellow">I won't need to dry clean this anymore.</font>

695
00:54:07,888 --> 00:54:09,258
<font color="yellow">You said...</font>

696
00:54:10,528 --> 00:54:12,488
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't hear from you.</font>

697
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:21,658
<font color="yellow">Your news came anyway.</font>

698
00:54:47,528 --> 00:54:49,088
<font color="yellow">It's my last job.</font>

699
00:54:49,858 --> 00:54:51,058
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

700
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:53,328
<font color="yellow">You too.</font>

701
00:54:55,658 --> 00:54:58,028
<font color="yellow">Regardless of the time or the appearance you wear,</font>

702
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:00,588
<font color="yellow">be happy.</font>

703
00:55:02,028 --> 00:55:04,888
<font color="yellow">I've had a good life until now.</font>

704
00:55:06,488 --> 00:55:09,328
<font color="yellow">- Don't make it rain. - Don't worry.</font>

705
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:12,388
<font color="yellow">This has been my job for a long while.</font>

706
00:55:16,328 --> 00:55:19,758
<font color="yellow">Once the washing is done, make sure to hang the laundry.</font>

707
00:55:23,728 --> 00:55:26,788
<font color="yellow">When you're done with that, come to the tea house.</font>

708
00:55:27,988 --> 00:55:30,228
<font color="yellow">I plan to break the rules just one more time.</font>

709
00:55:30,988 --> 00:55:32,828
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving anyway.</font>

710
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:02,488
<font color="yellow">You haven't aged at all.</font>

711
00:56:02,588 --> 00:56:04,658
<font color="yellow">You're still just as handsome.</font>

712
00:56:05,828 --> 00:56:07,358
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

713
00:56:07,488 --> 00:56:09,928
<font color="yellow">You said I wouldn't hear from you.</font>

714
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:12,288
<font color="yellow">I had forgotten...</font>

715
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,558
<font color="yellow">that the man I was seeing was a grim reaper.</font>

716
00:56:17,388 --> 00:56:21,128
<font color="yellow">I forgot that you would find out.</font>

717
00:56:22,028 --> 00:56:23,458
<font color="yellow">I've missed you.</font>

718
00:56:24,328 --> 00:56:26,228
<font color="yellow">I knew you would.</font>

719
00:56:44,588 --> 00:56:48,588
<font color="yellow">I've always wanted to put it on you properly, at least once.</font>

720
00:56:49,228 --> 00:56:53,288
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I forced it on you so meanly that time.</font>

721
00:56:54,158 --> 00:56:57,658
<font color="yellow">I've missed you a lot.</font>

722
00:56:59,188 --> 00:57:00,988
<font color="yellow">I knew you would.</font>

723
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:06,328
<font color="yellow">You are the last deceased soul...</font>

724
00:57:06,858 --> 00:57:08,758
<font color="yellow">that I am leading.</font>

725
00:57:09,588 --> 00:57:11,028
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

726
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:15,358
<font color="yellow">Then what's next?</font>

727
00:57:15,758 --> 00:57:17,458
<font color="yellow">What happens to us?</font>

728
00:57:18,558 --> 00:57:20,858
<font color="yellow">Is this our happy ending?</font>

729
00:57:22,258 --> 00:57:26,588
<font color="yellow">This was your third life.</font>

730
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,458
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

731
00:57:30,088 --> 00:57:31,328
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

732
00:57:32,488 --> 00:57:33,888
<font color="yellow">I guess...</font>

733
00:57:35,228 --> 00:57:38,288
<font color="yellow">this may be the last time.</font>

734
00:57:41,188 --> 00:57:43,528
<font color="yellow">Your brother is here.</font>

735
00:57:44,558 --> 00:57:45,728
<font color="yellow">Outside.</font>

736
00:57:52,758 --> 00:57:54,928
<font color="yellow">You still don't care about your brother.</font>

737
00:57:54,928 --> 00:57:58,658
<font color="yellow">I am happy I get to see you at least like this...</font>

738
00:57:59,288 --> 00:58:00,858
<font color="yellow">before I go.</font>

739
00:58:00,858 --> 00:58:02,988
<font color="yellow">It is because I made a good friend.</font>

740
00:58:06,428 --> 00:58:10,658
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for going first and leaving you behind.</font>

741
00:58:11,128 --> 00:58:13,188
<font color="yellow">Please take care of yourself.</font>

742
00:58:13,628 --> 00:58:17,428
<font color="yellow">Let's meet again someday.</font>

743
00:58:17,988 --> 00:58:19,258
<font color="yellow">Be happy,</font>

744
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,428
<font color="yellow">my ugly sister.</font>

745
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:21,328
<font color="yellow">My sister,</font>

746
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:25,358
<font color="yellow">my friend,</font>

747
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:30,128
<font color="yellow">and my bride...</font>

748
00:59:33,658 --> 00:59:35,088
<font color="yellow">have all left.</font>

749
00:59:38,758 --> 00:59:40,388
<font color="yellow">And as always,</font>

750
00:59:41,942 --> 00:59:44,572
<font color="yellow">I am left all alone.</font>

751
01:00:13,771 --> 01:00:14,901
<font color="yellow">Cheer up.</font>

752
01:00:18,433 --> 01:00:20,563
<font color="yellow">Do you know why sandwiches come in pairs?</font>

753
01:00:20,563 --> 01:00:22,403
<font color="yellow">To share with someone else.</font>

754
01:00:22,403 --> 01:00:24,133
<font color="yellow">Take it.</font>

755
01:00:24,933 --> 01:00:28,733
<font color="yellow">There are lots of jobs in this world. We'll find one.</font>

756
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,040
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

757
01:00:34,303 --> 01:00:35,803
<font color="yellow">You're young.</font>

758
01:00:35,803 --> 01:00:37,563
<font color="yellow">I know you're frustrated.</font>

759
01:00:38,403 --> 01:00:40,103
<font color="yellow">Try to cheer up, though.</font>

760
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,133
<font color="yellow">Some people shine...</font>

761
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:45,233
<font color="yellow">later on in life.</font>

762
01:00:48,733 --> 01:00:50,433
<font color="yellow">Every life is touched...</font>

763
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:54,963
<font color="yellow">by a deity at least once.</font>

764
01:00:56,863 --> 01:00:59,433
<font color="yellow">Just when you're drifting away from the world,</font>

765
01:01:00,363 --> 01:01:03,433
<font color="yellow">if someone nudged you back in the right direction,</font>

766
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:05,503
<font color="yellow">that would be...</font>

767
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:08,803
<font color="yellow">when the deity chose to visit you.</font>

768
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,363
<font color="yellow">I have to go.</font>

769
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:15,063
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

770
01:01:16,903 --> 01:01:18,803
<font color="yellow">Go this way instead.</font>

771
01:01:19,363 --> 01:01:22,163
<font color="yellow">You will meet someone who needs your help.</font>

772
01:01:23,903 --> 01:01:25,563
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the sandwich.</font>

773
01:01:34,663 --> 01:01:37,363
<font color="yellow">Do you know anything about cars?</font>

774
01:01:37,363 --> 01:01:38,563
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

775
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:42,363
<font color="yellow">I can tell that this one's not running.</font>

776
01:01:43,563 --> 01:01:45,163
<font color="yellow">Can I help you?</font>

777
01:01:47,363 --> 01:01:48,763
<font color="yellow">Do you know about cars?</font>

778
01:01:48,763 --> 01:01:51,303
<font color="yellow">I've been fixing them for about 20 years.</font>

779
01:01:53,163 --> 01:01:54,433
<font color="yellow">Let's have a look.</font>

780
01:01:54,433 --> 01:01:56,533
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you call your insurance company?</font>

781
01:01:56,533 --> 01:01:58,133
<font color="yellow">They'd sort things out for you.</font>

782
01:01:59,663 --> 01:02:01,233
<font color="yellow">Did you call the insurance company?</font>

783
01:02:01,233 --> 01:02:05,203
<font color="yellow">I got distracted when you opened the hood.</font>

784
01:02:05,303 --> 01:02:06,933
<font color="yellow">I'll call right away.</font>

785
01:02:07,063 --> 01:02:08,433
<font color="yellow">I believe...</font>

786
01:02:10,603 --> 01:02:13,503
<font color="yellow">I was meant to meet you.</font>

787
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,663
<font color="yellow">Were we?</font>

788
01:02:16,503 --> 01:02:18,933
<font color="yellow">That's a romantic thought, Sir.</font>

789
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:22,933
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm a bit of a romantic.</font>

790
01:02:23,063 --> 01:02:24,303
<font color="yellow">There we go.</font>

791
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:33,603
<font color="yellow">As I sent the lantern flying that night,</font>

792
01:03:34,533 --> 01:03:36,563
<font color="yellow">I prayed that my sister, in her future...</font>

793
01:03:37,433 --> 01:03:39,663
<font color="yellow">and my master, in his future...</font>

794
01:03:41,133 --> 01:03:43,433
<font color="yellow">would meet again one day.</font>

795
01:03:45,233 --> 01:03:47,863
<font color="yellow">And when they meet again,</font>

796
01:03:48,433 --> 01:03:49,833
<font color="yellow">that they be happy.</font>

797
01:03:51,133 --> 01:03:52,503
<font color="yellow">That had been my wish.</font>

798
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:00,503
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

799
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,803
<font color="yellow">I arrest people right away,</font>

800
01:04:01,803 --> 01:04:03,133
<font color="yellow">handcuff them without hesitation...</font>

801
01:04:03,133 --> 01:04:04,763
<font color="yellow">and read them their rights.</font>

802
01:04:04,763 --> 01:04:06,403
<font color="yellow">You have the right to remain silent,</font>

803
01:04:06,403 --> 01:04:07,803
<font color="yellow">the right to refuse to testify...</font>

804
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:10,703
<font color="yellow">I asked what this is about. Is that a hard question to ask?</font>

805
01:04:10,703 --> 01:04:13,503
<font color="yellow">You asked me to show you how I act out an arrest.</font>

806
01:04:13,563 --> 01:04:16,633
<font color="yellow">I just... I asked you to show me,</font>

807
01:04:16,633 --> 01:04:18,133
<font color="yellow">not actually handcuff me.</font>

808
01:04:18,133 --> 01:04:20,303
<font color="yellow">Your criminal's over there.</font>

809
01:04:22,263 --> 01:04:24,833
<font color="yellow">Oh, is she the criminal?</font>

810
01:04:25,063 --> 01:04:27,933
<font color="yellow">You looked more like one. Sorry.</font>

811
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:32,963
<font color="yellow">Don't I look like a detective?</font>

812
01:04:32,963 --> 01:04:35,633
<font color="yellow">At 1st glance, 2nd glance and 3rd glance,</font>

813
01:04:35,633 --> 01:04:37,163
<font color="yellow">you look like a criminal.</font>

814
01:04:37,163 --> 01:04:40,763
<font color="yellow">How dare you. What makes you think I'm a criminal?</font>

815
01:04:40,863 --> 01:04:43,433
<font color="yellow">Did I steal your heart or something?</font>

816
01:04:44,433 --> 01:04:46,803
<font color="yellow">You look like the hostess of a gambling den.</font>

817
01:04:46,803 --> 01:04:48,663
<font color="yellow">From head to toe.</font>

818
01:04:48,663 --> 01:04:50,633
<font color="yellow">I just look like one.</font>

819
01:04:50,633 --> 01:04:53,803
<font color="yellow">I'm working undercover. Undercover.</font>

820
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:57,103
<font color="yellow">We're pretending this is 2016.</font>

821
01:04:58,433 --> 01:04:59,803
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

822
01:04:59,803 --> 01:05:02,333
<font color="yellow">Director, who is this guy?</font>

823
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,863
<font color="yellow">Why is he so rude?</font>

824
01:05:03,863 --> 01:05:06,363
<font color="yellow">Didn't I introduce you two?</font>

825
01:05:06,363 --> 01:05:09,203
<font color="yellow">He's our consultant, a detective from a violent crimes unit.</font>

826
01:05:09,203 --> 01:05:11,733
<font color="yellow">I'm Lee Hyuk from Gangnam Police Station.</font>

827
01:05:18,063 --> 01:05:19,703
<font color="yellow">Lee Hyuk? No way.</font>

828
01:05:20,633 --> 01:05:21,703
<font color="yellow">I heard that.</font>

829
01:05:26,303 --> 01:05:29,063
<font color="yellow">Don't get any ideas.</font>

830
01:05:29,063 --> 01:05:30,733
<font color="yellow">I'm an actress...</font>

831
01:05:30,733 --> 01:05:32,703
<font color="yellow">and we're filming nearby.</font>

832
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:35,733
<font color="yellow">The crew didn't book a hotel...</font>

833
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:39,063
<font color="yellow">so I'm here because I don't have a choice.</font>

834
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:46,603
<font color="yellow">I'm her stylist.</font>

835
01:05:47,303 --> 01:05:49,433
<font color="yellow">I have only one free room.</font>

836
01:05:51,733 --> 01:05:53,433
<font color="yellow">I can't believe...</font>

837
01:05:53,433 --> 01:05:56,533
<font color="yellow">why there's always only one free room.</font>

838
01:05:56,533 --> 01:05:59,503
<font color="yellow">That's too bad. We'll take it.</font>

839
01:06:01,363 --> 01:06:02,603
<font color="yellow">Quickly, please.</font>

840
01:06:02,903 --> 01:06:05,163
<font color="yellow">We could try looking for another hotel...</font>

841
01:06:05,163 --> 01:06:07,003
<font color="yellow">but we'd only get sore legs.</font>

842
01:06:07,003 --> 01:06:09,433
<font color="yellow">Sore legs become swollen.</font>

843
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:12,803
<font color="yellow">The more sleep I get the nicer my skin will be tomorrow.</font>

844
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:15,933
<font color="yellow">Why didn't they book a room for the actress?</font>

845
01:06:15,933 --> 01:06:17,573
<font color="yellow">I never wanted to know.</font>

846
01:06:17,763 --> 01:06:19,203
<font color="yellow">Here's the key.</font>

847
01:06:20,533 --> 01:06:23,003
<font color="yellow">Lead the way, stylist.</font>

848
01:06:26,163 --> 01:06:27,503
<font color="yellow">Do you have a room?</font>

849
01:06:28,103 --> 01:06:30,863
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I only have one left.</font>

850
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:34,603
<font color="yellow">Pretend you didn't hear that.</font>

851
01:06:37,203 --> 01:06:38,533
<font color="yellow">I didn't hear anything.</font>

852
01:06:40,803 --> 01:06:43,363
<font color="yellow">So what will we do now?</font>

853
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:48,333
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean? - Like...</font>

854
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:51,433
<font color="yellow">"Should we date? Meet up regularly?"</font>

855
01:06:51,433 --> 01:06:54,663
<font color="yellow">"I like you." When will you say things like that?</font>

856
01:06:54,663 --> 01:06:56,403
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to?</font>

857
01:06:57,573 --> 01:06:59,033
<font color="yellow">Should I say that first?</font>

858
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:02,233
<font color="yellow">Should I, then? I'm an actress.</font>

859
01:07:02,233 --> 01:07:04,203
<font color="yellow">I'm already annoyed that I liked you first.</font>

860
01:07:04,903 --> 01:07:06,533
<font color="yellow">Who said you liked me first?</font>

861
01:07:06,533 --> 01:07:09,203
<font color="yellow">Everyone does. Are they all wrong?</font>

862
01:07:09,203 --> 01:07:10,433
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - How?</font>

863
01:07:10,433 --> 01:07:12,003
<font color="yellow">I liked you first.</font>

864
01:07:12,303 --> 01:07:13,663
<font color="yellow">That's my state...</font>

865
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:16,833
<font color="yellow">No, that's my confession.</font>

866
01:07:19,863 --> 01:07:21,333
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

867
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:23,163
<font color="yellow">Just a step too late...</font>

868
01:07:23,163 --> 01:07:25,133
<font color="yellow">and I might have liked you first.</font>

869
01:07:26,573 --> 01:07:28,003
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

870
01:07:44,233 --> 01:07:47,333
<font color="yellow">- What's this? - Consider it like a handcuff.</font>

871
01:07:47,573 --> 01:07:49,833
<font color="yellow">You just stole my heart.</font>

872
01:07:51,163 --> 01:07:52,663
<font color="yellow">Do you see this?</font>

873
01:07:52,663 --> 01:07:55,103
<font color="yellow">They call you the Grim Reaper.</font>

874
01:07:55,103 --> 01:07:57,433
<font color="yellow">Isn't this a bribe?</font>

875
01:08:00,363 --> 01:08:02,263
<font color="yellow">Arrest me, then.</font>

876
01:08:13,363 --> 01:08:16,633
<font color="yellow">Is this our first day together?</font>

877
01:08:31,133 --> 01:08:33,573
<font color="yellow">Are you going somewhere, Sir?</font>

878
01:08:34,203 --> 01:08:36,103
<font color="yellow">I'd like to go for a walk.</font>

879
01:08:36,703 --> 01:08:39,003
<font color="yellow">Avoid the main street if you can.</font>

880
01:08:39,163 --> 01:08:42,573
<font color="yellow">Some Korean students are visiting and they're noisy.</font>

881
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:46,233
<font color="yellow">- I shouldn't be long. - Of course, Sir.</font>

882
01:09:27,203 --> 01:09:28,363
<font color="yellow">I found him.</font>

883
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:31,703
<font color="yellow">There is no sadness that lasts for eternity.</font>

884
01:09:32,073 --> 01:09:34,073
<font color="yellow">There is no love that lasts for eternity either.</font>

885
01:09:34,233 --> 01:09:35,433
<font color="yellow">I'm going to vote that there is.</font>

886
01:09:35,433 --> 01:09:38,433
<font color="yellow">Which one are you voting for? Love or sadness?</font>

887
01:09:38,533 --> 01:09:40,033
<font color="yellow">Sad love.</font>

888
01:10:13,987 --> 01:10:15,287
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

889
01:10:16,603 --> 01:10:18,233
<font color="yellow">You know who I am, right?</font>

890
01:10:21,603 --> 01:10:23,433
<font color="yellow">The first and the last...</font>

891
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:27,803
<font color="yellow">goblin's bride.</font>

892
01:11:00,433 --> 01:11:23,877
<font color="yellow">Bioskop Keren</font>

893
01:11:32,713 --> 01:11:35,783
<font color="yellow">(Goblin)</font>

894
01:12:41,803 --> 01:12:48,033
<font color="yellow">(Thank you for watching Goblin.)</font>
