<font color="yellow">if I dare make a suggestion,</font>

110
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,830
<font color="yellow">could you give up trying to die...</font>

<font color="yellow">by your side.</font>

122
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,870

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,230

<font color="yellow">Whatever the case,</font>

127
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,840
<font color="yellow">it is good to be back.</font>

128
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200

130
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,670

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,000
<font color="yellow">It started off really well.</font>

132
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,300

<font color="yellow">with the first snow falling.</font>

134
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,130

138
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,100
<font color="yellow">I thought one of you wouldn't.</font>

139
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,800
<font color="yellow">I know. I thought he'd leave me in the field.</font>

140
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,200
<font color="yellow">He brought me back.</font>

141
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,130
<font color="yellow">The missing soul does not know yet...</font>

142
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,930
<font color="yellow">about what will happen when she pulls out his sword.</font>

143
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,340
<font color="yellow">Should I tell her what will happen?</font>

144
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,600
<font color="yellow">The goblin might die of fury.</font>

145
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,130
<font color="yellow">Then this house will be mine.</font>

146
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,670
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking?</font>

147
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,900
<font color="yellow">When you look at me like that,</font>

148
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,970
<font color="yellow">it gives me the chills.</font>

149
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,900
<font color="yellow">Why can't you touch the sword...</font>

150
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,570
<font color="yellow">although you can see it?</font>

151
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,300
<font color="yellow">I was trying to figure it out.</font>

152
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,030
<font color="yellow">You, too? So was I.</font>

153
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,900
<font color="yellow">Why is that?</font>

154
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,000
<font color="yellow">Is the goblin right?</font>

155
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,970
<font color="yellow">Am I really not his bride?</font>

156
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,130
<font color="yellow">Is there another bride who can touch the sword...</font>

157

<font color="yellow">and will she be pretty?</font>

158
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,230
<font color="yellow">Anyone could do the deed.</font>

159
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,340
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

160
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,270
<font color="yellow">Do you think he'd go back to being mean to me?</font>

161
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,800
<font color="yellow">We're pretty close now.</font>

162
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,030
<font color="yellow">One extra mouth to feed is really taxing our expenses.</font>

163
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,570
<font color="yellow">We're out of meat already.</font>

164
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,800
<font color="yellow">Should I start keeping track of receipts?</font>

165
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,170
<font color="yellow">I'm in too rotten a mood to do the dishes.</font>

166
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,170
<font color="yellow">I'll do the dishes.</font>

167
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,930
<font color="yellow">I really want to do the dishes.</font>

168
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
<font color="yellow">Do you?</font>

169
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,300
<font color="yellow">I guess you are at the age where you'd love to do the dishes.</font>

170
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,970
<font color="yellow">There's so much washing to do.</font>

171
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,270
<font color="yellow">I can't afford to send everything to the dry cleaner's.</font>

172
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,500
<font color="yellow">Should I throw out all my dirty clothes?</font>

173
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,470
<font color="yellow">You have me. As soon as I'm done with the dishes,</font>

174
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,370
<font color="yellow">I could do the laundry.</font>

175
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,830
<font color="yellow">Will you do that? If you insist,</font>

176
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,630
<font color="yellow">I prefer them to be hand-washed.</font>

177
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,870
<font color="yellow">I bet students find it easier to concentrate in a clean home.</font>

178
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,700
<font color="yellow">When will I clean all these rooms?</font>

179
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,000
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for the student in the house.</font>

180
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,200
<font color="yellow">Was that deliberate?</font>

181
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

182
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,000
<font color="yellow">I'm wet. You must see that.</font>

183
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,130
<font color="yellow">I wonder if they'll dry by this evening.</font>

184
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,630
<font color="yellow">You are doing that deliberately.</font>

185
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,170
<font color="yellow">Do you hate doing the washing? Tell me what's bothering you.</font>

186
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,130
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you brought that up.</font>

187
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,370
<font color="yellow">You must think I'm not your bride.</font>

188
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,570
<font color="yellow">Let's not jump to conclusions.</font>

189
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,400
<font color="yellow">You might seriously regret giving me a hard time.</font>

190
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,970
<font color="yellow">Do you mean you are my bride but you can only see my sword?</font>

191
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,730
<font color="yellow">You said every moment you spent with me shined.</font>

192
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,630
<font color="yellow">Because the weather was good, bad,</font>

193
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,500
<font color="yellow">- or good enough. - Yes.</font>

194
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,270
<font color="yellow">- Today as well. - See?</font>

195
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,570
<font color="yellow">- What? - Even now.</font>

196
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,600
<font color="yellow">You shine brilliantly.</font>

197
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,200
<font color="yellow">So why are you...</font>

198
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,930
<font color="yellow">- giving me a hard time? - That's different.</font>

199
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,470
<font color="yellow">How are they different issues? You said everything shines.</font>

200
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,430
<font color="yellow">Can't we stop doing this?</font>

201
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,270
<font color="yellow">Let's find another value.</font>

202
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,030
<font color="yellow">If I can't be your bride, since you're my boyfriend,</font>

203
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,000
<font color="yellow">I'll be your girlfriend.</font>

204
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,100
<font color="yellow">No, thanks.</font>

205
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,230
<font color="yellow">- How about acquaintances? - No.</font>

206
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,570
<font color="yellow">Then a lodger?</font>

207
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,430
<font color="yellow">Then pay 500 dollars a month in rent.</font>

208
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,070
<font color="yellow">Water and gas bills are separate.</font>

209
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,500
<font color="yellow">Did he demand you give him money?</font>

210
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,730
<font color="yellow">Yes. We're at loggerheads now.</font>

211
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,600
<font color="yellow">We're bound to clash sooner or later.</font>

212
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,930
<font color="yellow">Why can't I touch the stupid sword?</font>

213
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,030
<font color="yellow">Maybe you need something more powerful than the curse.</font>

214
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,470
<font color="yellow">Something like true love, for example.</font>

215
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,570
<font color="yellow">I tried that already.</font>

216
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,230
<font color="yellow">What did you do?</font>

217
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,670
<font color="yellow">A kiss.</font>

218
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,130
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

219
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,500
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't talk about that.</font>

220
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,170
<font color="yellow">Do you usually go around telling people whom you kissed?</font>

221
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,030
<font color="yellow">I didn't say anything. You did.</font>

222
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,300
<font color="yellow">- Weren't you going to? - I wasn't.</font>

223
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,330
<font color="yellow">They...</font>

224
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,270
<font color="yellow">- kissed? - It's about me.</font>

225
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,500
<font color="yellow">Why do you care?</font>

226
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,400
<font color="yellow">We're talking about my kiss.</font>

227
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,770
<font color="yellow">Hey. No one person can claim a kiss.</font>

228
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,100
<font color="yellow">Half of it is mine.</font>

229
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,400
<font color="yellow">Fine, take half.</font>

230
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,630
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want it.</font>

231
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,870
<font color="yellow">Then I'll keep it all.</font>

232
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,730
<font color="yellow">You do that, greedy bugger.</font>

233
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,430
<font color="yellow">Someone...</font>

234
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,100
<font color="yellow">can't make a call because he doesn't have a business card.</font>

235
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,700
<font color="yellow">These two are just...</font>

236
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,830
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

237
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,270
<font color="yellow">I guess I should be glad you're back,</font>

238
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,100
<font color="yellow">but shouldn't we send the girl packing?</font>

239
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,430
<font color="yellow">- What? - Don't you want to?</font>

240
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,470
<font color="yellow">Can't we send her away and be happy together like we used to be?</font>

241
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,870
<font color="yellow">Whom were you living with?</font>

242
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,800
<font color="yellow">She's not the goblin's bride. I'm going to kick her out.</font>

243
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,500
<font color="yellow">She knows who we are.</font>

244
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,670
<font color="yellow">We can't cut her loose and let her talk.</font>

245
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,100
<font color="yellow">She won't talk if you give her 5,000 dollars.</font>

246
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,470
<font color="yellow">Don't you watch TV dramas?</font>

247
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,370
<font color="yellow">Once you start paying people off, there's no end to it.</font>

248
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,200
<font color="yellow">Maybe you want her to stay.</font>

249
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,070
<font color="yellow">I want her gone.</font>

250
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,370
<font color="yellow">I want to send her away more than anything.</font>

251
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,170
<font color="yellow">- What? - She couldn't touch the sword.</font>

252
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,100
<font color="yellow">You're actually pleased about it, aren't you?</font>

253
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,330
<font color="yellow">Because you can live.</font>

254
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,430
<font color="yellow">Why would that be pleasing? Are you crazy?</font>

255
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,470
<font color="yellow">I've been waiting for this moment for over 900 years.</font>

256
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,170
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. I'll take her out of my friendship for you.</font>

257
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,630
<font color="yellow">She must bother you. She kissed you without permission.</font>

258
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,130
<font color="yellow">There is no friendship between us!</font>

259
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,400
<font color="yellow">What kind of a friend would want another friend to die?</font>

260
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,130
<font color="yellow">See? You're glad you aren't dead.</font>

261
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,800
<font color="yellow">I am not. I just have a promise that I must keep.</font>

262
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,770
<font color="yellow">I signed a contract.</font>

263
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,730
<font color="yellow">A man's word is worth his weight in gold.</font>

264
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,870
<font color="yellow">I made a promise and I will keep it because I'm a man.</font>

265
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,770
<font color="yellow">Were you not a man when you gave me the deeds to the house?</font>

266
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,230
<font color="yellow">When a goblin becomes angry...</font>

267
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,330
<font color="yellow">Hey, come back. Reaper. Reaper?</font>

268
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,530
<font color="yellow">Reaper.</font>

269
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,570
<font color="yellow">On the day of the first snowfall every year,</font>

270
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,270
<font color="yellow">the goblin agrees to be summoned by me.</font>

271
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,330
<font color="yellow">I will be waiting for you.</font>

272
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,570
<font color="yellow">Why are you here and not in your own room?</font>

273
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,130
<font color="yellow">Are you protesting?</font>

274
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,540
<font color="yellow">I want to stay close to where the snacks are.</font>

275
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,430
<font color="yellow">The snacks stopped coming after you stopped trying to impress me.</font>

276
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,870
<font color="yellow">You're so cheap.</font>

277
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,600
<font color="yellow">Our family fortune is going downhill.</font>

278
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,570
<font color="yellow">It's a luxury we can't afford right now.</font>

279
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,630
<font color="yellow">Can you not get on my nerves?</font>

280
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,670
<font color="yellow">I'm in a very sensitive state right now...</font>

281
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,600
<font color="yellow">since I'm preparing for the exam.</font>

282
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,200
<font color="yellow">Are you being cranky right now?</font>

283
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,370
<font color="yellow">What kind of a guardian are you? I have exams coming up.</font>

284
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,700
<font color="yellow">What? What is it?</font>

285
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,170
<font color="yellow">Do you by any chance...</font>

286
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,100
<font color="yellow">know the answers to the college entrance exam?</font>

287
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,200
<font color="yellow">I do. When is the exam?</font>

288
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,270
<font color="yellow">You don't know when it is, but you know the answers?</font>

289
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,540
<font color="yellow">Yes. Do you want me to tell you?</font>

290
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,270
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - First, do the practice questions.</font>

291
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,200
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

292
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,170
<font color="yellow">For your information, it's next Thursday.</font>

293
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,540
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

294
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,470
<font color="yellow">on that day of the first snowfall...</font>

295
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,470
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

296
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,970
<font color="yellow">I wanted to bring it up first.</font>

297
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,300
<font color="yellow">Don't feel pressured.</font>

298
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,730
<font color="yellow">That was my first kiss, of course.</font>

299
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,130
<font color="yellow">I was going to talk about the snow. The snowfall.</font>

300
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,370
<font color="yellow">Oh, the first snowfall.</font>

301
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,470
<font color="yellow">Don't say it.</font>

302
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,000
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about anything related to being the first one.</font>

303
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,400
<font color="yellow">- You got the first question wrong. - I said don't.</font>

304
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,270
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you hungry? - I said stop it.</font>

305
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,230
<font color="yellow">It's so noisy from all the traffic. It's not good for you.</font>

306
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,870
<font color="yellow">Do you like your bed?</font>

307
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,870

402
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,820
<font color="yellow">This is crazy. Why do I keep seeing things these days?</font>

<font color="yellow">Which one do you want? The rabbit or the raccoon?</font>

408
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,720
<font color="yellow">Lighter. I want the lighter.</font>

409

444
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,190
<font color="yellow">You ate countless cows before that. Are you unhealthy?</font>

445
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,960
<font color="yellow">It's delicious. You should've gotten some.</font>

446
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,720

447
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,160
<font color="yellow">How long are you going to nag at me?</font>

448
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,390
<font color="yellow">You gave me gifts and then took them back. I liked that bag.</font>

449

450
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,990

451
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,760
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure I don't next time.</font>

452
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,860
<font color="yellow">You were so strange when you gave them to me...</font>

453
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,360
<font color="yellow">as if you were going to leave.</font>

454
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,890
<font color="yellow">You told me to use them when I got older.</font>

455
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:15,560
<font color="yellow">You gave Deok Hwa a credit card, then the house to Grim Reaper.</font>

456
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,120
<font color="yellow">It's what everyone wanted.</font>

457
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,660
<font color="yellow">They were like goodbye gifts.</font>

458
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,760
<font color="yellow">Am I right? Were they goodbye gifts?</font>

<font color="yellow">Don't mind me. Mind your own business.</font>

582
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,420
<font color="yellow">It's just that I'm better than you.</font>

<font color="yellow">It really disappeared.</font>

597

598

<font color="yellow">It's as if he's a ghost.</font>

599

<font color="yellow">I won the bet,</font>

600
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,720
<font color="yellow">and I asked you to get rid of the piano.</font>

601
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,720
<font color="yellow">I was really bad, but my mom couldn't give up.</font>

<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

613
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,720
<font color="yellow">Is that all you can say?</font>

614
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,220
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm doing this indecent thing to hear that?</font>

615
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,190
<font color="yellow">If you don't erase his memory, he'll spread a rumor about me.</font>

616
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,820
<font color="yellow">Then I'd have to leave here.</font>

617
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,520
<font color="yellow">You wanted to live happily with me.</font>

618
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,190
<font color="yellow">I thought you never said it.</font>

619
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,960
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't live like that. You have to help others.</font>

620
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,160
<font color="yellow">Why would I help the goblin who can't even erase memories?</font>

621
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,020
<font color="yellow">All right. We'll see.</font>

622
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,720
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

623
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,590
<font color="yellow">- Hey! - You were going to cook it anyway.</font>

624
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,790
<font color="yellow">All right. It's perfect.</font>

625
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:56,860
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

626
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,120
<font color="yellow">I was...</font>

627
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,220
<font color="yellow">- I was just cleaning. - The vacuum's outside.</font>

628
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,760
<font color="yellow">Give me what you're sitting on.</font>

629
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,860
<font color="yellow">One more.</font>

630
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:32,360
<font color="yellow">I think I signed only once.</font>

631
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,220
<font color="yellow">Really? Then why are there two copies here? Goodness.</font>

632
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,320
<font color="yellow">You've committed forgery of documents, trespass,</font>

633
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,890
<font color="yellow">- and theft. - Gosh, you're so cheap.</font>

634
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,760
<font color="yellow">Girl groups make you forget about the thousand years of rage.</font>

635
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,060
<font color="yellow">I apologize for not knowing that you're one of those people.</font>

636
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,360
<font color="yellow">This is mine, so give it back to me.</font>

637
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,120
<font color="yellow">I came here to get this back. You have no idea.</font>

638
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,960
<font color="yellow">I told you to read it. I never said you could keep it.</font>

639
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,820
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Look at that girl.</font>

640
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,090
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

641
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,860
<font color="yellow">I can't tell which is the original and which is a copy.</font>

642
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,160
<font color="yellow">I can't compliment her for being talented at this.</font>

643
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:15,360
<font color="yellow">What will she become when she grows up?</font>

644
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,920
<font color="yellow">Was he careless with it because it wasn't his?</font>

645
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,890
<font color="yellow">I'm so annoyed. I'd better not find anything.</font>

646
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,760
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

647
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,290
<font color="yellow">He wrote in it because it wasn't his.</font>

648
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,660
<font color="yellow">Seriously. "First love"?</font>

649
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,960
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

650
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:47,260
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he had one.</font>

651
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,420
<font color="yellow">That broom did everything there is to do.</font>

652
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,090
<font color="yellow">It was my first kiss.</font>

653
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,860
<font color="yellow">He has an ugly handwriting.</font>

654
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,920
<font color="yellow">(Tae Hee)</font>

655
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,120
<font color="yellow">Hi, Tae Hee.</font>

656
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,790
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

657
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:55,840
<font color="yellow">What about it?</font>

658
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,840
<font color="yellow">The phone's ringing.</font>

659
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,640
<font color="yellow">(Sunny not Sun Hee)</font>

660
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,340
<font color="yellow">So what about it?</font>

661
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,610
<font color="yellow">Answer it for me.</font>

662
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,110
<font color="yellow">If I avoid her again, she may really kill me.</font>

663
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:06,810
<font color="yellow">But I don't have a business card yet, so I can't pick up.</font>

664
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,610
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say.</font>

665
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,040
<font color="yellow">Just this once.</font>

666
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,710
<font color="yellow">Why don't you have anything to say?</font>

667
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:14,010
<font color="yellow">"Don't you know my voice? My voice isn't easy to forget."</font>

668
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:15,240
<font color="yellow">Do that.</font>

669
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,310
<font color="yellow">You said let's not help each other. You said you don't need me.</font>

670
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,040
<font color="yellow">You, Grim Reaper, with zero foresight.</font>

671
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,610
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

672
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,110
<font color="yellow">Where did that missing soul go?</font>

673
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,840
<font color="yellow">She can't help you, either.</font>

674
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:28,510
<font color="yellow">She's too busy giggling in front of the ice cream place.</font>

675
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,810
<font color="yellow">Don't bother.</font>

676
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:30,970
<font color="yellow">Giggling?</font>

677
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,370
<font color="yellow">Why is she outside...</font>

678
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:34,110
<font color="yellow">Shut it! I don't want to explain.</font>

679
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,470
<font color="yellow">I was thinking about it and it was just so cool.</font>

680
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,310
<font color="yellow">How could I run into you like that there?</font>

681
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,940
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

682
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,640
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

683
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:04,210
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

684
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:06,410
<font color="yellow">Thinking about you now and then?</font>

685
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,710
<font color="yellow">You're so funny.</font>

686
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,440
<font color="yellow">Missing soul.</font>

687
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:17,210
<font color="yellow">Take this call.</font>

688
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:19,310
<font color="yellow">Are you insane?</font>

689
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,340
<font color="yellow">How could you follow me here?</font>

690
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:23,070
<font color="yellow">Who is he?</font>

691
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,870
<font color="yellow">Is he your father?</font>

692
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,640
<font color="yellow">You are...</font>

693
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,270
<font color="yellow">careless with your words.</font>

694
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,810
<font color="yellow">And what is your name, careless one?</font>

695
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:42,640
<font color="yellow">No! Don't tell him your name. Don't look him in the eye. Look down.</font>

696
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,440
<font color="yellow">I cannot take this call...</font>

697
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,640
<font color="yellow">so take the call for me.</font>

698
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,870
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I shall ask his name...</font>

699
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,510
<font color="yellow">and write it down carefully.</font>

700
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,540
<font color="yellow">Take care of it.</font>

701
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:59,970
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

702
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,840
<font color="yellow">I'll be right back.</font>

703
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,640
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

704
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,770
<font color="yellow">Careless one, sit down.</font>

705
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:15,010
<font color="yellow">So you used to play the piano and now, you play baseball?</font>

706
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,240
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

707
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,970
<font color="yellow">She'll get the wrong idea if a woman picks up.</font>

708
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,110
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

709
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,440
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

710
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,070
<font color="yellow">Isn't this Kim Woo Bin's phone?</font>

711
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,470
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

712
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,370

<font color="yellow">He's a director.</font>

715
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,440
<font color="yellow">What kind of a company promotes employees in a second?</font>

716
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:56,740
<font color="yellow">Whatever. I know he's there. Tell him tomorrow, 1pm at the same cafe.</font>

717
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,640
<font color="yellow">He may come as a manager or a director.</font>

718
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,340

721
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:10,540
<font color="yellow">How did it go? What did she say?</font>

722
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:17,040
<font color="yellow">Talk in person. Tomorrow at 1pm. The same cafe.</font>

723
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:23,040
<font color="yellow">But her voice sounded very familiar.</font>

724
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,810
<font color="yellow">- Is she... - Stop.</font>

725
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,340
<font color="yellow">My question first.</font>

726
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,870

00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,540

729

<font color="yellow">Past relationships. Ideal woman. And so on.</font>

730
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,110
<font color="yellow">You don't know what she'll ask. Prepare answers for them all.</font>

<font color="yellow">Do you like me? Although you kept avoiding my calls?</font>

741
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:25,610
<font color="yellow">I thought...</font>

742
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:29,110
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't like someone who didn't have a business card.</font>

743
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:32,710

<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

748
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,310
<font color="yellow">I wonder what you do.</font>

749
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,440
<font color="yellow">My face is my business card.</font>

750
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,640
<font color="yellow">It says right here, doesn't it? "Pretty person".</font>

751

<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

753
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:01,570
<font color="yellow">I wish...</font>

754
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,440
<font color="yellow">I could take one.</font>

755
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:10,070
<font color="yellow">See? It's so much fun when we meet in person.</font>

756
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:12,210
<font color="yellow">You get to learn more about me and we can get closer.</font>

760
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,540
<font color="yellow">Not that. Like hobbies and things like that.</font>

762
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,040
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

763

<font color="yellow">Your unpredictable acts...</font>

764
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:41,740
<font color="yellow">draw me in more than a drama does.</font>

765
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,670
<font color="yellow">Your unpredictability...</font>

766
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,640
<font color="yellow">incites my imagination.</font>

767
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,440
<font color="yellow">I am clueless...</font>

768
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,510
<font color="yellow">and keep giving the wrong answer.</font>

769
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,970
<font color="yellow">My new hobby I found in you seems like...</font>

770
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:56,840
<font color="yellow">the deity's plan...</font>

771
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:58,910
<font color="yellow">or perhaps,</font>

772
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,740
<font color="yellow">the deity's mistake.</font>

773
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:06,940
<font color="yellow">You speak so well.</font>

774
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,570
<font color="yellow">Do you have a religion?</font>

775
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,340
<font color="yellow">Do I need to have something else again?</font>

776
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,010
<font color="yellow">I'll call you when I have it.</font>

777
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:19,040
<font color="yellow">No! You don't need one.</font>

778
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,270
<font color="yellow">Sit back down before I kill you.</font>

779
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,570
<font color="yellow">What is with this man?</font>

780
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:34,710
<font color="yellow">I'm 34 years old. My birthday is November 5th.</font>

781
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,510
<font color="yellow">No, no! You don't need to tell me.</font>

782
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,440
<font color="yellow">Just sit there.</font>

783
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,040
<font color="yellow">I'll pretend I'm looking at a magazine.</font>

784
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,010
<font color="yellow">What do you like?</font>

785
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,870
<font color="yellow">Vegetables. Okay, then.</font>

786
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,370
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

787
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:02,110
<font color="yellow">I have to go that way.</font>

788
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:03,770
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

789
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,140
<font color="yellow">Weren't we going to eat?</font>

790
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,440
<font color="yellow">You won't even feed me?</font>

791
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,340
<font color="yellow">You ate an entire hotdog.</font>

792
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,140
<font color="yellow">Overeating is the source of all illnesses.</font>

793
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:18,540
<font color="yellow">You're the one who gets me ill more than anything else.</font>

794
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,070
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Where are you going?</font>

795
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,210
<font color="yellow">I have a company outing.</font>

796
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,170
<font color="yellow">I have to pay a fine if I skip it.</font>

797
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:26,470
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

798
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:31,540
<font color="yellow">You're so clueless, and everything you do is wrong.</font>

799
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,110
<font color="yellow">It's all wrong.</font>

800
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:36,710
<font color="yellow">The questions are too difficult.</font>

801
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:42,770
<font color="yellow">Let's drink to the death!</font>

802
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:44,940
<font color="yellow">- Cheers! - Cheers!</font>

803
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,540
<font color="yellow">Don't drink too much.</font>

804
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:54,370
<font color="yellow">Watch where you're going, will you?</font>

805
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:56,010
<font color="yellow">Use your eyes.</font>

806
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,570
<font color="yellow">Does he have a death wish?</font>

807
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,710
<font color="yellow">Do you think he knows what he just did?</font>

808
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:06,570
<font color="yellow">He'll do something to anger the spirits in less than a month.</font>

809
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,010
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

810
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:11,010
<font color="yellow">That's his fate. Let's go, I need to use the restroom.</font>

811
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,440
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

812
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:15,940
<font color="yellow">- Cheers! - Cheers, cheers.</font>

813
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,570
<font color="yellow">The treasurer's here. It's time to wind down.</font>

814
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,840
<font color="yellow">- Pay the bill. - Okay.</font>

815
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:26,440
<font color="yellow">That's a lot.</font>

816
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,140
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

817
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,840
<font color="yellow">- Is something missing? - The money.</font>

818
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:47,410
<font color="yellow">Watch where you're going, will you?</font>

819
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,040
<font color="yellow">He was a pickpocket. The man I bumped into.</font>

820
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:55,510
<font color="yellow">No wonder. What should we do now?</font>

821
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,670
<font color="yellow">He stole from the wrong guy.</font>

822
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:03,310
<font color="yellow">This won't do. Put your hats on one at a time.</font>

823
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:07,070
<font color="yellow">Move slowly and take turns so that no one notices.</font>

824
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,710
<font color="yellow">Are we allowed to do this?</font>

825
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:13,240
<font color="yellow">We have to write up a formal apology...</font>

826
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,570
<font color="yellow">if we use our powers for anything other than work.</font>

827
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,140
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'll make sure you don't have to.</font>

828
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:22,810
<font color="yellow">Year of 23, you guys can leave first.</font>

829
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:28,570
<font color="yellow">I know of a way.</font>

830
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,510
<font color="yellow">What is it? Can you get us off the hook?</font>

831
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:32,910
<font color="yellow">You'll see.</font>

832
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,840
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

833
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:18,540
<font color="yellow">I need your help.</font>

834
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:24,770
<font color="yellow">Will you be his guarantor?</font>

835
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,070
<font color="yellow">That's the only way I can release him.</font>

836
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,770
<font color="yellow">There's a misunderstanding.</font>

837
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,670
<font color="yellow">I'm here because he called me, but I don't know him.</font>

838
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,440
<font color="yellow">He never was of any help to me.</font>

839
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:37,910
<font color="yellow">I'm not entirely sure how I can help him.</font>

840
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:39,970
<font color="yellow">Didn't you receive his call?</font>

841
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:46,070
<font color="yellow">Let's agree to say you know me. I'll help you out.</font>

842
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,270
<font color="yellow">I'll erase Tae Hee's memories.</font>

843
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:50,570
<font color="yellow">I just remembered who he is.</font>

844
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,740
<font color="yellow">Eating without paying?</font>

845
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,710
<font color="yellow">That's such a crass crime that I've never heard of.</font>

846
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,140
<font color="yellow">Where do I sign?</font>

847
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,910
<font color="yellow">This is who I am.</font>

848
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,170
<font color="yellow">You have...</font>

849
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,040
<font color="yellow">a business card?</font>

850
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:17,440
<font color="yellow">What's going on? Why do you have a business card?</font>

851
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,540
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

852
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,110
<font color="yellow">- Have some tofu. - Did you know?</font>

853
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:22,640
<font color="yellow">He has a business card.</font>

854
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,140
<font color="yellow">A business card? Of course he does.</font>

855
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:26,740
<font color="yellow">He owns the whole company.</font>

856
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,370
<font color="yellow">Hotel, trading, ship-building, oil, construction, and furniture.</font>

857
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:32,240
<font color="yellow">- Didn't you know? - Stop it. I didn't tell him.</font>

858
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,770
<font color="yellow">That's how rich I am.</font>

859
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:36,310
<font color="yellow">Here, have some tofu.</font>

860
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,140
<font color="yellow">I've always wanted to do this.</font>

861
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:41,570
<font color="yellow">Like uncle, like nephew. Get out of my way.</font>

862
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,210
<font color="yellow">Why does he always walk like that?</font>

863
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:52,110
<font color="yellow">I got it. I finally figured it out.</font>

864
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,450
<font color="yellow">He sees something when he touches someone.</font>

865
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,060
<font color="yellow">The person's previous life.</font>

866
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,750
<font color="yellow">He can see someone's past life?</font>

867
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,720
<font color="yellow">What about you? What kind of power do you have?</font>

868
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:04,510
<font color="yellow">My power is staying alive.</font>

869
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,980
<font color="yellow">You can't do anything but make it rain, can you?</font>

870
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,180
<font color="yellow">You forgot your tofu.</font>

871
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,080
<font color="yellow">I guess the missing soul isn't back yet.</font>

872
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,950
<font color="yellow">Is she out with him?</font>

873
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,680
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Where are you?</font>

874
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,220
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you back yet? It's scary out there at night.</font>

875
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,220
<font color="yellow">It's only 7pm, and I'm busy right now.</font>

876
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,280
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

877
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,220
<font color="yellow">The phone has been turned off.</font>

878
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,320
<font color="yellow">Please leave a message...</font>

879
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,650
<font color="yellow">Unbelievable.</font>

880
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,880
<font color="yellow">Which of you saw the goblin's bride?</font>

881
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,050
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

882
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:12,320
<font color="yellow">Uncle!</font>

883
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,420
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

884
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:19,880
<font color="yellow">He's not in. He went out.</font>

885
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,220
<font color="yellow">Did he?</font>

886
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,920
<font color="yellow">Then can you pass this to him?</font>

887
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,550
<font color="yellow">I forgot that it was in my car.</font>

888
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,420
<font color="yellow">Why give him this when he took your credit card?</font>

889
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,680
<font color="yellow">My grandpa said he'd give me an allowance if I deliver this.</font>

890
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,950
<font color="yellow">- You humans... - That's how scary...</font>

891
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:36,580
<font color="yellow">and convenient capitalism is.</font>

892
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:42,880
<font color="yellow">He gave you a credit card and me the deed to the house.</font>

893
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,220
<font color="yellow">He must've given your grandfather something more valuable.</font>

894
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,620
<font color="yellow">Do you think so?</font>

895
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:51,120
<font color="yellow">I don't know what this is. Shall we have a look?</font>

896
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:52,320
<font color="yellow">He isn't here.</font>

897
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,650
<font color="yellow">She's really pretty.</font>

898
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,680
<font color="yellow">Who is she? Is she his ex-girlfriend?</font>

899
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,750
<font color="yellow">This looks really old.</font>

900
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:25,380
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it?</font>

901
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,850
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

902
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,620
<font color="yellow">It was the beginning of a terribly sad love story.</font>

903
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,620
<font color="yellow">This thing called destiny is so sad.</font>

904
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,580
<font color="yellow">It's not a sin to fall in love.</font>

905
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:31,850
<font color="yellow">Maybe they didn't deserve what they got.</font>

906
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:39,250
<font color="yellow">What did I do to deserve a sudden raise in rent?</font>

907
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,750
<font color="yellow">I can't afford to pay an extra 100 dollars a month.</font>

908
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,580
<font color="yellow">Ever since you moved in,</font>

909
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,580
<font color="yellow">I keep dreaming of grim reapers.</font>

910
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:50,580
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

911
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,750
<font color="yellow">The tap in my bathroom is leaking. When will you fix it?</font>

912
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:57,150
<font color="yellow">Is it leaking? Then don't shower.</font>

913
01:04:57,550 --> 01:04:59,180
<font color="yellow">You'll still be pretty.</font>

914
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:09,550
<font color="yellow">You can sing.</font>

915
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,420
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

916
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,120
<font color="yellow">How did you know I'd be here?</font>

917
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,180
<font color="yellow">You can run but you can't hide.</font>

918
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:21,520
<font color="yellow">What about the chicken place? Did you get fired?</font>

919
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,550
<font color="yellow">I'm working multiple jobs now.</font>

920
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,250
<font color="yellow">Singing at weddings pays well.</font>

921
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:27,820
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

922
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,450
<font color="yellow">watching wedding ceremonies...</font>

923
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:32,220
<font color="yellow">makes me feel strange.</font>

924
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:34,350
<font color="yellow">Why do you feel strange?</font>

925
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,180
<font color="yellow">Just...</font>

926
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:40,650
<font color="yellow">"I won't have a mom to light the candles..."</font>

927
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,250
<font color="yellow">"or a dad to hold my hand."</font>

928
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:48,380
<font color="yellow">"I won't have friends to take pictures of me."</font>

929
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:51,950
<font color="yellow">"Without any friends, there won't be any congratulatory money."</font>

930
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,790
<font color="yellow">Such thoughts come to my mind.</font>

931
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:56,050
<font color="yellow">It's funny, right?</font>

932
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:58,680
<font color="yellow">That's probably why...</font>

933
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,620
<font color="yellow">I was obsessed with being your bride.</font>

934
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:06,750
<font color="yellow">It felt like we were becoming family.</font>

935
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:12,320
<font color="yellow">I thought I could have what I never had.</font>

936
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:18,380
<font color="yellow">I thought it came to me like fate.</font>

937
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:29,580
<font color="yellow">Why... Why are you crying?</font>

938
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,250
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to make me feel sorry?</font>

939
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,550
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

940
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,120
<font color="yellow">In the end,</font>

941
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,080
<font color="yellow">I should be the one who's sorry.</font>

942
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,550
<font color="yellow">You know what?</font>

943
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:45,150
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

944
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,980
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I couldn't draw the sword.</font>

945
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:51,880
<font color="yellow">I've been meaning to tell you,</font>

946
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:55,050
<font color="yellow">but every time we met, we got into an argument.</font>

947
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:00,450
<font color="yellow">I know this isn't the perfect timing,</font>

948
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,180
<font color="yellow">but I should say it now that we're talking about it.</font>

949
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:08,120
<font color="yellow">I'm working more jobs...</font>

950
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,320
<font color="yellow">and steadily preparing myself.</font>

951
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:14,880
<font color="yellow">So can you wait a little longer until I leave the house?</font>

952
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,680
<font color="yellow">Stop being mean to me.</font>

953
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:21,790
<font color="yellow">Until I'm ready to leave,</font>

954
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,290
<font color="yellow">can you give me a 50 percent discount...</font>

955
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,950
<font color="yellow">when you're being mean to me? Please?</font>

956
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,720
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can do that.</font>

957
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:54,920
<font color="yellow">Not the 50 percent discount.</font>

958
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,380
<font color="yellow">45 percent?</font>

959
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:22,080
<font color="yellow">What is it? Are you hurt?</font>

960
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,650
<font color="yellow">Is it the sword?</font>

961
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:55,350
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

962
01:09:58,290 --> 01:09:59,620
<font color="yellow">I can grab the sword.</font>

963
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:05,020
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

964
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,850
<font color="yellow">Hold on. I'll pull it out for you.</font>

965
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,020
<font color="yellow">It's moving.</font>

966
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:01,950
<font color="yellow">The oracle was real.</font>

967
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,650
<font color="yellow">The future I foresaw was correct.</font>

968
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,080
<font color="yellow">With this girl's help,</font>

969
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,320
<font color="yellow">I'll be able to end this curse of eternity...</font>

970
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:20,680
<font color="yellow">and return to ashes.</font>

971
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,650
<font color="yellow">A mortal soul can only live up to 100 years.</font>

972
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:34,720
<font color="yellow">Is what I'm looking for...</font>

973
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,120
<font color="yellow">my life as an immortal soul...</font>

974
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:41,450
<font color="yellow">or your face?</font>

975
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,920
<font color="yellow">I think it's your face.</font>

976
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:35,520
<font color="yellow">(Goblin)</font>

977
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:39,720
<font color="yellow">I told you. I really am your bride.</font>

978
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,080
<font color="yellow">This was destined to happen.</font>

979
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:43,680
<font color="yellow">It was destiny.</font>

980
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:45,680
<font color="yellow">It's nice.</font>

981
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,450
<font color="yellow">Who on earth are you?</font>

982
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:53,480
<font color="yellow">Why are you making me feel smoldered?</font>

983
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:00,480
<font color="yellow">I think I saw her from somewhere.</font>

984
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:04,650
<font color="yellow">How did you remember your past life?</font>

985
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,790
<font color="yellow">One day after 100 years...</font>

986
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:12,920
<font color="yellow">When the weather is good enough...</font>

987
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:17,420
<font color="yellow">One day after 100 years...</font>

988
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:20,880
<font color="yellow">When the weather is good enough,</font>

989
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,820
<font color="yellow">I wish I could tell her that she was my first love.</font>

990
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:31,120
<font color="yellow">I ask for permission to be granted.</font>
