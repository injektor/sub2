00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,950
<font color="yellow">I should be the one asking that.</font>

<font color="yellow">Is this you, by any chance?</font>

52
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,420
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you doing anything? Go deal with it.</font>

<font color="yellow">My uncle lacks social skills, so he shattered the society.</font>

71
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,050

79
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,050
<font color="yellow">please line up over there.</font>

<font color="yellow">The car was damaged by unexpectedly strong wind.</font>

81
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,480

82
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,050
<font color="yellow">You did not see me today.</font>

83
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,250
<font color="yellow">Next.</font>

84
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,650
<font color="yellow">It's me. By the way, isn't it too dark here?</font>

85
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,080
<font color="yellow">I don't feel too good.</font>

86
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,920
<font color="yellow">Would you please look at my eyes?</font>

87
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,680
<font color="yellow">The car was damaged by unexpectedly strong wind.</font>

88
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,020
<font color="yellow">The money fell from the sky. That's it.</font>

89
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,880
<font color="yellow">You did not see me today.</font>

90
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,350
<font color="yellow">Next. Next.</font>

91
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,580
<font color="yellow">Come on. Hurry up.</font>

92
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,820
<font color="yellow">Look at my eyes. Look.</font>

93
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,980
<font color="yellow">Next.</font>

94
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,150
<font color="yellow">What's the model of your car?</font>

95
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,750
<font color="yellow">We'll be done once we delete these files.</font>

96
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,550
<font color="yellow">Will you look at my eyes?</font>

97
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,220
<font color="yellow">How badly do a couple have to fight to break 30 cars?</font>

98
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,440
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard we had to work?</font>

99
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,450
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

100
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,990
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Don't thank us.</font>

101
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,220
<font color="yellow">I just don't have the energy to fight.</font>

102
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,370
<font color="yellow">Let's delay the fight. I feel depressed enough.</font>

103
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,590
<font color="yellow">You still won't be as depressed as me.</font>

104
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,350
<font color="yellow">How do you know if you're worse than me?</font>

105
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,350
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

106
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,180
<font color="yellow">This thing was stuck about...</font>

107
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,620
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

108
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,290
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

109
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,150
<font color="yellow">Did you almost die or what?</font>

110
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,920
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

111
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,420
<font color="yellow">Mr. Buckwheat. We don't have to leave anymore.</font>

112
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,950
<font color="yellow">I am surely the goblin's bride.</font>

113
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,980
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my body aches.</font>

114
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,580
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

115
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,480
<font color="yellow">Is he... Is he dead?</font>

116
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,880
<font color="yellow">It's the medication.</font>

117
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,580
<font color="yellow">Let him sleep.</font>

118
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,520
<font color="yellow">He'll wake up with an ache if he sleeps on the floor.</font>

119
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,650
<font color="yellow">You should carry him to...</font>

120
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,150
<font color="yellow">Yes, do that.</font>

121
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,520
<font color="yellow">If you can, that is.</font>

122
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,550
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

123
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,880
<font color="yellow">Why did you take the pills?</font>

124
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,680
<font color="yellow">Are you still in pain?</font>

125
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,150
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

126
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,320
<font color="yellow">Why does my heart ache so?</font>

127
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,880
<font color="yellow">Our pickled radishes taste good.</font>

128
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,620
<font color="yellow">37.</font>

129
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,050
<font color="yellow">38.</font>

130
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,970
<font color="yellow">I will go home once number 50 goes by.</font>

131
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,620
<font color="yellow">I'll be nice.</font>

132
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,880
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have a fever.</font>

133
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,150
<font color="yellow">You're an adult.</font>

134
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,980
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't fall asleep in random places.</font>

135
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,080
<font color="yellow">I'm sick, that's why.</font>

136
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,480
<font color="yellow">Are you awake?</font>

137
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,080
<font color="yellow">I smelled your muscle patch.</font>

138
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,220
<font color="yellow">My body aches.</font>

139
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,050
<font color="yellow">Does yours hurt, too?</font>

140
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,550
<font color="yellow">You said you were okay before.</font>

141
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,750
<font color="yellow">I lied.</font>

142
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,280
<font color="yellow">You always lie.</font>

143
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,750
<font color="yellow">Get well soon.</font>

144
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,350
<font color="yellow">You don't know where it hurts.</font>

145
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,220
<font color="yellow">Where does it hurt?</font>

146
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,520
<font color="yellow">My first love hurt me really badly.</font>

147
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,350
<font color="yellow">She must've been really pretty.</font>

148
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,420
<font color="yellow">You even wrote something about her.</font>

149
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,280
<font color="yellow">She's very pretty.</font>

150
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,020
<font color="yellow">Every day.</font>

151
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,250
<font color="yellow">She's pretty.</font>

152
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,720
<font color="yellow">You're very sick.</font>

153
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,350
<font color="yellow">You're in a critical condition.</font>

154
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,150
<font color="yellow">Sleep well so that your body aches really badly.</font>

155
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,580
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

156
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,180
<font color="yellow">Why not? I don't care about someone who isn't over his first love.</font>

157
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,150
<font color="yellow">What a thing to say to your bride.</font>

158
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,020
<font color="yellow">She's pretty if you look hard enough.</font>

159
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,780
<font color="yellow">So stay here.</font>

160
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:24,650
<font color="yellow">I told you not to use words that start with a certain letter.</font>

161
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,980
<font color="yellow">You're so mean.</font>

162
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,350
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

163
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,650
<font color="yellow">I want all the vegetables and toast the bread.</font>

164
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,680
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

165
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,050
<font color="yellow">Here's the bribe you ordered.</font>

166
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,950
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

167
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,820
<font color="yellow">Where's the item?</font>

168
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,450
<font color="yellow">Can you really interpret this?</font>

169
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,320
<font color="yellow">Any rich heir should memorize the 1,000 basic characters at age 3.</font>

170
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,450
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

171
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,280
<font color="yellow">Something about your uncle and his first love.</font>

172
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,580
<font color="yellow">It's our secret.</font>

173
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,880
<font color="yellow">Listen, little girl. I love looking into someone's background.</font>

174
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

175
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,780
<font color="yellow">This character means "to hear", just in case you didn't know.</font>

176
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,120
<font color="yellow">Don't say you can't read it after you ate that sandwich.</font>

177
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,280
<font color="yellow">It's a love letter.</font>

178
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,050
<font color="yellow">- A love letter? - Yes.</font>

179
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,220
<font color="yellow">It's a sad confession of love.</font>

180
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,720
<font color="yellow">"After 100 years..."</font>

181
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,020
<font color="yellow">"On a good-enough day..."</font>

182
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,620
<font color="yellow">My worst fear came true.</font>

183
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,780
<font color="yellow">That'll do. I know who it's about.</font>

184
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,820
<font color="yellow">- Who? - I heard all about her.</font>

185
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,250
<font color="yellow">It's totally understandable. In his 900-year life,</font>

186
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,550
<font color="yellow">he could have met someone unforgettable.</font>

187
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,620
<font color="yellow">- Just one? - Is it not?</font>

188
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,120
<font color="yellow">- I don't know. - You scared me.</font>

189
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,280
<font color="yellow">Anyway, about Mr. Kim Shin.</font>

190
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

191
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,850
<font color="yellow">Your uncle.</font>

192
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,350
<font color="yellow">Is he Kim Shin? He's Yu Shin Jae.</font>

193
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
<font color="yellow">Well... It's a long story.</font>

194
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,350
<font color="yellow">Anyway, about the sword that's stuck in his chest...</font>

195
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,150
<font color="yellow">There's a sword in his chest?</font>

196
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,810
<font color="yellow">- What do you know? - What sword is it?</font>

197
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,940
<font color="yellow">If you don't tell me everything, I'll end up with a complex.</font>

198
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,980
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you know or I won't tell you what only I know.</font>

199
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,510
<font color="yellow">What is it that only you know?</font>

200
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,520
<font color="yellow">He saw her portrait and cried?</font>

201
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,350
<font color="yellow">- The Grim Reaper did? - Yes, he sobbed.</font>

202
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,430
<font color="yellow">I tried to talk him out of it but he insisted we take a look.</font>

203
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,590
<font color="yellow">Did he really cry?</font>

204
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,460
<font color="yellow">- Why? - I don't know.</font>

205
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,090
<font color="yellow">Let's be angry at him and ask why.</font>

206
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,850
<font color="yellow">Why did you look at my painting? He said he tried to stop you.</font>

207
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,320
<font color="yellow">I heard you cried. Why? Even I don't cry.</font>

208
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,450
<font color="yellow">I was so confused that I thought about it long and hard.</font>

209
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,350
<font color="yellow">I think it was something like Stendhal syndrome.</font>

210
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,570
<font color="yellow">I felt so moved and almost stopped breathing.</font>

211
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,040
<font color="yellow">Who is the woman in the painting by the way?</font>

212
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,970
<font color="yellow">- Why do you care? - I think...</font>

213
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,940
<font color="yellow">she looks familiar.</font>

214
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,140
<font color="yellow">Who do you think she is?</font>

215
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,540
<font color="yellow">This woman is my sister.</font>

216
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,370
<font color="yellow">You have a big sister?</font>

217
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,240
<font color="yellow">Have you seen my little sister?</font>

218
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,840
<font color="yellow">Think about it. Where was it?</font>

219
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,000
<font color="yellow">Little sister...</font>

220
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,700
<font color="yellow">I think she may be one of my deceased souls,</font>

221
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,500
<font color="yellow">but I'm not positive.</font>

222
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,840
<font color="yellow">She was reincarnated? When?</font>

223
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,240
<font color="yellow">I said I wasn't sure.</font>

224
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:59,070
<font color="yellow">I can't remember everyone I took away.</font>

225
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,440
<font color="yellow">She seems familiar, so I'm guessing.</font>

226
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,340
<font color="yellow">I don't remember. I just feel.</font>

227
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,240
<font color="yellow">I was just extremely sad.</font>

228
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,900
<font color="yellow">My heart felt like it was breaking.</font>

229
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,600
<font color="yellow">Uncles, I know.</font>

230
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,440
<font color="yellow">I think I know.</font>

231
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,270
<font color="yellow">Maybe the Grim Reaper is your sister's reincarnation.</font>

232
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,770
<font color="yellow">Try calling him your brother.</font>

233
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,270
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to die? - Do you want to die?</font>

234
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,700
<font color="yellow">Bro...</font>

235
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,200
<font color="yellow">Broth...</font>

236
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,740
<font color="yellow">Have you heard the news?</font>

237
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,970
<font color="yellow">About Messenger Kim from Janghang-dong.</font>

238
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,900
<font color="yellow">What about him?</font>

239
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,770
<font color="yellow">He went to pick up a soul,</font>

240
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,600
<font color="yellow">and it was his wife in a previous life.</font>

241
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,440
<font color="yellow">So he put her name on the missing soul's list and ran off with her.</font>

242
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,700
<font color="yellow">- So? - That is all.</font>

243
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,400
<font color="yellow">I don't know the rest.</font>

244
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,770
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they were caught.</font>

245
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,200
<font color="yellow">How did he remember his past life?</font>

246
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,370
<font color="yellow">Who knows?</font>

247
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,070
<font color="yellow">That's why everyone's nervous. I've been drinking every day, too.</font>

248
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,940
<font color="yellow">I keep thinking.</font>

249
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,500
<font color="yellow">They say you become a grim reaper if you commit a great sin.</font>

250
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,670
<font color="yellow">I wonder how bad a sin it was.</font>

251
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,700
<font color="yellow">Maybe they erased our memory so that we wouldn't be tormented by it.</font>

252
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,170
<font color="yellow">So that we can repent while doing this work?</font>

253
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,370
<font color="yellow">It must be the deity's consideration.</font>

254
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,440
<font color="yellow">If you remember, you remember. If not, you don't.</font>

255
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,270
<font color="yellow">It is all the deity's will.</font>

256
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,600
<font color="yellow">However, I wonder why he returned the memories...</font>

257
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,500
<font color="yellow">that he had forgotten.</font>

258
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,800
<font color="yellow">I wonder.</font>

259
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,670
<font color="yellow">Jin Young!</font>

260
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,200
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

261
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,470
<font color="yellow">- Did you have fun? - Yes.</font>

262
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,370
<font color="yellow">What should we eat?</font>

263
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,240
<font color="yellow">I need to go.</font>

264
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,440
<font color="yellow">Don't drink too much.</font>

265
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,200
<font color="yellow">Have a nice day.</font>

266
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,040
<font color="yellow">Mom, where are we?</font>

267
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,600
<font color="yellow">I think it's a tea shop.</font>

268
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,400
<font color="yellow">What are we drinking? What are you going to order?</font>

269
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,340
<font color="yellow">I ordered paradise...</font>

270
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,840
<font color="yellow">to give it to you.</font>

271
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,970
<font color="yellow">Paradise?</font>

272
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,470
<font color="yellow">Here is paradise that you ordered.</font>

273
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,570
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

274
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,470
<font color="yellow">Mom, why are you crying?</font>

275
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,440
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - Oh my gosh.</font>

276
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,570
<font color="yellow">What are you doing there?</font>

277
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,340
<font color="yellow">I was going to the library.</font>

278
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,470
<font color="yellow">What about you? Do you know them?</font>

279
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,070
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

280
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,270
<font color="yellow">Step aside.</font>

281
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,340
<font color="yellow">Open the window, air out the room, and button up.</font>

282
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,770
<font color="yellow">You'll need this.</font>

283
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,700
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

284
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,900
<font color="yellow">Daddy.</font>

285
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,970
<font color="yellow">Hi. How did you get here?</font>

286
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,200
<font color="yellow">I got in a taxi and showed her the address.</font>

287
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,370
<font color="yellow">It was five dollars.</font>

288
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,840
<font color="yellow">- I'm going here. - I know where that is.</font>

289
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,770
<font color="yellow">Buckle up.</font>

290
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,000
<font color="yellow">Daddy, I'm hungry.</font>

291
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,540
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

292
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:06,400
<font color="yellow">Okay. Here.</font>

293
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,170
<font color="yellow">Daddy, I've missed you.</font>

294
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,840
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

295
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,670
<font color="yellow">You were pretty cool again today.</font>

296
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,700
<font color="yellow">At times, a parent, a child, or a sibling...</font>

297
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,900
<font color="yellow">becomes each other's guardian spirit.</font>

298
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,870
<font color="yellow">I merely gave him a sandwich.</font>

299
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,740
<font color="yellow">I did not save that man. His daughter did.</font>

300
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,340
<font color="yellow">That's cool too.</font>

301
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,070
<font color="yellow">The sandwich costs a lot.</font>

302
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,140
<font color="yellow">It's a good thing Chairman Yu makes a lot of money.</font>

303
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,170
<font color="yellow">But you know, about the sword...</font>

304
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,610
<font color="yellow">Why do you think it suddenly moved?</font>

305
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,140
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even grab it. Right?</font>

306
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,340
<font color="yellow">Maybe you need something more powerful than a curse.</font>

307
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,940
<font color="yellow">For example, true love. Something like that.</font>

308
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,800
<font color="yellow">Don't you have something to say to me?</font>

309
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,500
<font color="yellow">- No, I don't. - I'm sure you do.</font>

310
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,270
<font color="yellow">Oh, that?</font>

311
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,770
<font color="yellow">- There is one thing. - See? You do.</font>

312
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,570
<font color="yellow">Don't hold it in. You're totally obvious.</font>

313
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,970
<font color="yellow">Tell me. It's okay.</font>

314
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:34,610
<font color="yellow">Whatever you say, I'll accept it without judgment.</font>

315
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,640
<font color="yellow">I know you have a lot of money,</font>

316
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,900
<font color="yellow">but is it okay to just stay home?</font>

317
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,800
<font color="yellow">Is that what you wanted to tell me?</font>

318
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,270
<font color="yellow">You worked for the country during the Goryeo Era, but that's it.</font>

319
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,040
<font color="yellow">Hey. Are you done? I had a career, too.</font>

320
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:03,570
<font color="yellow">It won't make you immortal, but you won't get drunk for a while.</font>

321
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,070
<font color="yellow">It won't make you immortal, but you'll smell nice for a while.</font>

322
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,670
<font color="yellow">It won't make you immortal, but you'll be happy for a while.</font>

323
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,040
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking down to me?</font>

324
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,400
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Ma'am.</font>

325
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,800
<font color="yellow">- Yu Jae Shin. - My apologies.</font>

326
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,000
<font color="yellow">My apologies for that, as well.</font>

327
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,670
<font color="yellow">That's why you just stay home.</font>

328
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,500
<font color="yellow">- Because you are lacking. - What do you mean, I'm lacking?</font>

329
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,540
<font color="yellow">What do you think? You're lacking brain cells.</font>

330
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,500
<font color="yellow">Seriously, I've never heard that before.</font>

331
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,200
<font color="yellow">Ever. Seriously. Never.</font>

332
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,940
<font color="yellow">I guess your first love never told you that.</font>

333
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,500
<font color="yellow">Are you jealous?</font>

334
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:02,270
<font color="yellow">What? Why would I be jealous?</font>

335
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,070
<font color="yellow">I don't know when she lived or anything.</font>

336
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,170
<font color="yellow">When did you meet? Goryeo? Joseon?</font>

337
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,470
<font color="yellow">Mid Joseon? Late Joseon?</font>

338
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she must have been pretty.</font>

339
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,270
<font color="yellow">But you know, first loves never work out.</font>

340
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,340
<font color="yellow">Go home. Don't wait for me.</font>

341
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,070
<font color="yellow">I'll be late.</font>

342
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,070
<font color="yellow">Who says first loves don't work out?</font>

343
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,570
<font color="yellow">I don't like that.</font>

344
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,640
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Ho.</font>

345
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,700
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

346
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,200
<font color="yellow">What's "Hey, ho"?</font>

347
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:03,470
<font color="yellow">Wasn't that funny? Everyone else thought it was funny.</font>

348
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,440
<font color="yellow">It's lame.</font>

349
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,670
<font color="yellow">You know, your birthmark faded a lot.</font>

350
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,070
<font color="yellow">Really? Maybe it's because I'm getting older.</font>

351
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,740
<font color="yellow">Why do you always waste money on this when I can't drink it?</font>

352
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,070
<font color="yellow">It's such a waste.</font>

353
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,070
<font color="yellow">Who would get you coffee other than me?</font>

354
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,370
<font color="yellow">How did the exams go?</font>

355
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,700
<font color="yellow">Good, of course.</font>

356
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,870
<font color="yellow">That's why you should tell me your story before it's too late.</font>

357
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,400
<font color="yellow">Other ghosts are busy...</font>

358
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,370
<font color="yellow">telling me their stories and begging me to help them.</font>

359
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,640
<font color="yellow">Why haven't you said anything to me?</font>

360
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,310
<font color="yellow">Once I go to college, I won't be able to come here often.</font>

361
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,770
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

362
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,100
<font color="yellow">will you come visit me?</font>

363
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,100
<font color="yellow">I'd love some nice flowers.</font>

364
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,170
<font color="yellow">I'm in Paju.</font>

365
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,470
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll come.</font>

366
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,340
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

367
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,570
<font color="yellow">how did you die?</font>

368
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,570
<font color="yellow">It was on my graduation day.</font>

369
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,570
<font color="yellow">There was a car accident.</font>

370
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,870
<font color="yellow">I'll be waiting, then.</font>

371
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,600
<font color="yellow">What happened to her?</font>

372
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,820
<font color="yellow">- Welcome. - Hello.</font>

373
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:02,370
<font color="yellow">How did you know I was here?</font>

374
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,240
<font color="yellow">I'm even more surprised. Why did it have to be here?</font>

375
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
<font color="yellow">There are more chicken restaurants in Korea than the total number...</font>

376
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,370
<font color="yellow">of McDonald's in the world.</font>

377
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,170
<font color="yellow">Why did it have to be this one?</font>

378
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,900
<font color="yellow">Because this is the one Mr. Goblin put me in.</font>

379
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,370
<font color="yellow">He's such a hindrance to my life.</font>

380
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,970
<font color="yellow">What is it today?</font>

381
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:23,900
<font color="yellow">You're giving me heart attacks. Are you going to keep this up?</font>

382
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,540
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I'm here?</font>

383
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,040
<font color="yellow">I'm here to get chicken. Give me one.</font>

384
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,440
<font color="yellow">Don't lie.</font>

385
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,570
<font color="yellow">I know you're a vegetarian.</font>

386
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,240
<font color="yellow">Even if you know, give me one.</font>

387
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,700
<font color="yellow">I want that one with extra radishes.</font>

388
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,040
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

389
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,700
<font color="yellow">Were you supposed to meet him?</font>

390
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,940
<font color="yellow">Did I just walk in at the scene by coincidence?</font>

391
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,370
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? You can't touch that.</font>

392
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,000
<font color="yellow">You're not supposed to be seen by humans, either.</font>

393
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,870
<font color="yellow">Just go sit in the corner.</font>

394
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,040
<font color="yellow">If you stay quiet, I'll give you an extra drumstick.</font>

395
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,100
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

396
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,100
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

397
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,140
<font color="yellow">Please take a seat.</font>

398
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,470
<font color="yellow">Sit down. What would you like?</font>

399
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,900
<font color="yellow">I thought about it, and what do you think about...</font>

400
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,340
<font color="yellow">chicken for dinner?</font>

401
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,700
<font color="yellow">Aren't you craving...</font>

402
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,700
<font color="yellow">chicken for dinner?</font>

403
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,200
<font color="yellow">I guess we have no choice.</font>

404
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,670
<font color="yellow">Tonight's dinner will have to be chicken.</font>

405
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,940
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for being selfish,</font>

406
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,810
<font color="yellow">but tonight's dinner is...</font>

407
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,970
<font color="yellow">Shut it.</font>

408
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,200
<font color="yellow">Grim Reaper, I need to talk to you.</font>

409
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,870
<font color="yellow">You can start without me. I'll be back before it's cold.</font>

410
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,870
<font color="yellow">I'd rather just die...</font>

411
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,440
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep coming to our store?</font>

412
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,570
<font color="yellow">It can't be because of me.</font>

413
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,810
<font color="yellow">Are you after my boss?</font>

414
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:11,970
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

415
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,770
<font color="yellow">I only go there to see her.</font>

416
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,340
<font color="yellow">As long as you keep quiet,</font>

417
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,240
<font color="yellow">everything will be peaceful.</font>

418
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,840
<font color="yellow">It's you who should keep quiet.</font>

419
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,040
<font color="yellow">Don't mention about Tae Hee's visiting me...</font>

420
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,900
<font color="yellow">and that he smiled at me.</font>

421
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,700
<font color="yellow">He also bought two more chickens on his way out.</font>

422
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,270
<font color="yellow">It's our secret.</font>

423
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,470
<font color="yellow">A secret?</font>

424
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,070
<font color="yellow">He came to visit you at work? He smiled at you?</font>

425
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,570
<font color="yellow">Sure, you might want to keep his smile a secret,</font>

426
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,170
<font color="yellow">but why the take out?</font>

427
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,900
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth. How many coupons did you give him?</font>

428
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,270
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. How many times did he visit you?</font>

429
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:45,440
<font color="yellow">Let's say he came five times. How many coupons should he have?</font>

430
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,470
<font color="yellow">I said, be quiet!</font>

431
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,900
<font color="yellow">Hey. Do you know who allowed him to play baseball?</font>

432
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,700
<font color="yellow">I used to be his guardian,</font>

433
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,170
<font color="yellow">so I taught him everything. You're clueless.</font>

434
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:59,170
<font color="yellow">Let's say what you claim is true. However, it can't be all you.</font>

435
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,270
<font color="yellow">My first love Tae Hee's will played a big part.</font>

436
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,270
<font color="yellow">Don't you know about the human will? Just look at me.</font>

437
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,200
<font color="yellow">I ended up grabbing your sword.</font>

438
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,370
<font color="yellow">I won't let you get pretty.</font>

439
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,770
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait.</font>

440
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,370
<font color="yellow">What is the process for an unnatural death?</font>

441
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,140
<font color="yellow">Tell me the basics, and I'll try to do it myself.</font>

442
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,270
<font color="yellow">I'll also help you with the chicken coupons.</font>

443
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,100
<font color="yellow">I know a faster way. Why should I ask you for help?</font>

444
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,270
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak.</font>

445
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,740
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Ji Eun Tak.</font>

446
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,700
<font color="yellow">It somehow reappeared out of nowhere.</font>

447
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,240
<font color="yellow">Not a single soul saw it when this huge thing was put back.</font>

448
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,440
<font color="yellow">It's unfathomable, isn't it?</font>

449
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,800
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak.</font>

450
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,340
<font color="yellow">Do you have a minute? I have to ask you something.</font>

451
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,170
<font color="yellow">Did you do well on your exams?</font>

452
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,400
<font color="yellow">You could say that. Why?</font>

453
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,770
<font color="yellow">You must have done really well.</font>

454
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,340
<font color="yellow">You're conceited.</font>

455
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,140
<font color="yellow">I bet you did well, too.</font>

456
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,340
<font color="yellow">You're really smart.</font>

457
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,100
<font color="yellow">I know you don't get any tutoring.</font>

458
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,640
<font color="yellow">That's pretty amazing.</font>

459
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,470
<font color="yellow">- Are you being sarcastic? - No, I mean it.</font>

460
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,140
<font color="yellow">Which schools did you apply for?</font>

461
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:14,970
<font color="yellow">I don't want to overlap.</font>

462
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,540
<font color="yellow">We probably applied for the same schools,</font>

463
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,470
<font color="yellow">but I won't overlap with you.</font>

464
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,770
<font color="yellow">I'm considered as an underprivileged student.</font>

465
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,000
<font color="yellow">So... Are you getting accepted?</font>

466
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,300
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

467
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,640
<font color="yellow">I heard you see ghosts.</font>

468
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,800
<font color="yellow">Don't they tell you things like that?</font>

469
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,200
<font color="yellow">I'm curious if I'll get accepted.</font>

470
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,800
<font color="yellow">That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?</font>

471
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,070
<font color="yellow">At least you're being fair.</font>

472
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,840
<font color="yellow">You're not talking behind my back.</font>

473
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,540
<font color="yellow">I can't stand being curious about something.</font>

474
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,170
<font color="yellow">That must be why you're so good at studying.</font>

475
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,900
<font color="yellow">I can see them,</font>

476
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,540
<font color="yellow">but they don't tell me anything.</font>

477
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,700
<font color="yellow">I have to go.</font>

478
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,470
<font color="yellow">We were in the same class for three years,</font>

479
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,170
<font color="yellow">but we talked the most today.</font>

480
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,670
<font color="yellow">You have the interview tomorrow at Seoun University, right?</font>

481
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:05,740
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

482
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,570
<font color="yellow">You too.</font>

483
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,800
<font color="yellow">You didn't care earlier whether I left or not.</font>

484
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,900
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

485
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,200
<font color="yellow">- Didn't you forget something? - What?</font>

486
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,240
<font color="yellow">My scarf!</font>

487
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,440
<font color="yellow">It's because you ignored me and got me irritated.</font>

488
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,740
<font color="yellow">Don't get cold feet...</font>

489
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:17,600
<font color="yellow">and don't get nervous.</font>

490
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,300
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to come with you?</font>

491
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:27,240
<font color="yellow">I'm not a kid.</font>

492
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,870
<font color="yellow">Why isn't the bus coming?</font>

493
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:33,300
<font color="yellow">- Are you still mad at me? - I was planning to,</font>

494
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,600
<font color="yellow">but I failed because of the scarf.</font>

495
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,700
<font color="yellow">- I was right. You're jealous. - So what?</font>

496
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,270
<font color="yellow">- Are you happy I'm jealous? - Yes. I was happy the whole day.</font>

497
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:47,900
<font color="yellow">You should go home.</font>

498
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,070
<font color="yellow">I'll do well on my interview.</font>

499
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,140
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the scarf.</font>

500
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,440
<font color="yellow">Watch out behind you.</font>

501
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:56,240
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

502
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,770
<font color="yellow">I was going to dodge her.</font>

503
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,470
<font color="yellow">Your eyes are so huge and clear that everything reflects on it.</font>

504
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:04,170
<font color="yellow">All right. Just get on the bus.</font>

505
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,170
<font color="yellow">Thief! It's a pickpocket!</font>

506
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,840
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

507
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:29,070
<font color="yellow">But why?</font>

508
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,600
<font color="yellow">You're not in the scene.</font>

509
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:32,900
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

510
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:43,570
<font color="yellow">My mom will kill me if I fail another interview.</font>

511
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,070
<font color="yellow">I wish I got into a car accident.</font>

512
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,440
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

513
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,170
<font color="yellow">You should be careful what you wish for.</font>

514
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:52,200
<font color="yellow">Death by Mom or traffic accident. What's the difference?</font>

515
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,600
<font color="yellow">Everyone dies at some point.</font>

516
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,770
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

517
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,570
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired.</font>

518
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,040
<font color="yellow">Have some coffee, Sir.</font>

519
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,900
<font color="yellow">I was the one who said I was tired. Why don't you have one for me?</font>

520
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,540
<font color="yellow">I told him not to bring you one.</font>

521
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,640
<font color="yellow">Are you still sullen about last time?</font>

522
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,300
<font color="yellow">Who says I'm sullen?</font>

523
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,270
<font color="yellow">Everyone says that.</font>

524
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:27,440
<font color="yellow">It's good that you know.</font>

525
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:32,900
<font color="yellow">Who are the new faces?</font>

526
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,170
<font color="yellow">They came to back us up from Hannam-dong.</font>

527
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:37,000
<font color="yellow">It must be a serious accident.</font>

528
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,270
<font color="yellow">I heard everyone from the support team got five each.</font>

529
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,870
<font color="yellow">You have way more than that.</font>

530
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:43,870
<font color="yellow">It's because this is my jurisdiction.</font>

531
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,670
<font color="yellow">Kim Hyun Jeong, age 34.</font>

532
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:52,600
<font color="yellow">Park Soo Bin.</font>

533
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,800
<font color="yellow">Age two. Death by accident.</font>

534
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,270
<font color="yellow">They must be mother and baby.</font>

535
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,100
<font color="yellow">I should prepare another paradise.</font>

536
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:04,200
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

537
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,470
<font color="yellow">You should call it a day and head home early.</font>

538
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,840
<font color="yellow">I didn't even get started and you want me to call it a day?</font>

539
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,900
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

540
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,340
<font color="yellow">It means I'll buy everything you have.</font>

541
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,930
<font color="yellow">Why are you so impatient? Aren't you too young for that?</font>

542
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,500
<font color="yellow">- Do you even know what's in there? - Socks.</font>

543
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,770
<font color="yellow">What do you say? Will you do as I say?</font>

544
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,600
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

545
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:29,990
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

546
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,200
<font color="yellow">You're the one from the bus stop.</font>

547
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,470
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep following me?</font>

548
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:35,900
<font color="yellow">Make a guess.</font>

549
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:00,070
<font color="yellow">The cash you stole was merely 23 dollars, 32 dollars,</font>

550
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,650
<font color="yellow">10 dollars, and 3 meal coupons.</font>

551
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:06,700
<font color="yellow">Do you know how many people could've died because of that?</font>

552
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:12,600
<font color="yellow">What are you?</font>

553
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:15,270
<font color="yellow">- Are you a cop? - The person you stole from...</font>

554
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:18,370
<font color="yellow">gets diagnosed with fracture that takes three weeks to recover from.</font>

555
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,600
<font color="yellow">She'd lose her job if she rests that long...</font>

556
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,670
<font color="yellow">so she works without wearing a cast for three weeks because of you.</font>

557
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,400
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you on about?</font>

558
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,940
<font color="yellow">Does this wallet belong to you?</font>

559
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,570
<font color="yellow">The monthly pay goes into medical expenses.</font>

560
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:31,170
<font color="yellow">You make her go into shock from the untreated fracture.</font>

561
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,700
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth or you'll regret it.</font>

562
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,440
<font color="yellow">I asked you who you are.</font>

563
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,740
<font color="yellow">It's not to my liking that I have to save someone like you,</font>

564
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:42,000
<font color="yellow">but it'll have to be a side effect from meddling with human lives.</font>

565
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,540
<font color="yellow">But don't think your punishment is over.</font>

566
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,140
<font color="yellow">You will be punished even after your death.</font>

567
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:51,370
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

568
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,870
<font color="yellow">An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</font>

569
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:56,740
<font color="yellow">This is my way of doing things.</font>

570
00:53:58,570 --> 00:53:59,770
<font color="yellow">It'll hurt a little.</font>

571
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,270
<font color="yellow">Bear with it if you'd like.</font>

572
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,370
<font color="yellow">Oh, my hand!</font>

573
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,170
<font color="yellow">Get on stand by. It's time for work soon.</font>

574
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,870
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

575
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,400
<font color="yellow">The bus is approaching.</font>

576
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,440
<font color="yellow">It's Mr. Grim Reaper.</font>

577
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,800
<font color="yellow">Did she just look at you?</font>

578
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,840
<font color="yellow">Can she see us right now?</font>

579
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,140
<font color="yellow">There are some who become like that before they die.</font>

580
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:00,270
<font color="yellow">Poor girl. She's still young.</font>

581
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,970
<font color="yellow">Why is she...</font>

582
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,470
<font color="yellow">Who has a name of Ji Eun Tak on the list?</font>

583
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,540
<font color="yellow">Who are you talking about?</font>

584
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,170
<font color="yellow">Wait, you're right. There is an extra person on the bus.</font>

585
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:13,800
<font color="yellow">I thought everyone died.</font>

586
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:18,200
<font color="yellow">Hold on. What happens when there's an extra?</font>

587
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,000
<font color="yellow">There isn't going to be an accident today.</font>

588
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,870
<font color="yellow">It's a bust.</font>

589
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,140
<font color="yellow">What? Why?</font>

590
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,370
<font color="yellow">That bus can't go like that.</font>

591
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,440
<font color="yellow">It's not supposed to. It should get in an accident now.</font>

592
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,900
<font color="yellow">Now should be the time.</font>

593
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,900
<font color="yellow">What do we do? Shouldn't we cause one?</font>

594
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,370
<font color="yellow">The bus just left. Nobody died.</font>

595
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:52,370
<font color="yellow">This has never happened to me in my 300 years of career.</font>

596
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,600
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

597
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:58,040
<font color="yellow">This is the first time I witnessed the occurrence of missing souls.</font>

598
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,140
<font color="yellow">This has to be a miracle.</font>

599
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,200
<font color="yellow">So miracles do happen.</font>

600
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,270
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much paperwork this miracle is worth of?</font>

601
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,900
<font color="yellow">Watch your mouth.</font>

602
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,100
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It's just so astonishing.</font>

603
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,140
<font color="yellow">But how did you know?</font>

604
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh.</font>

605
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,800
<font color="yellow">I think it's a goblin.</font>

606
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:31,470
<font color="yellow">What? Don't I look like one?</font>

607
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,270
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to you.</font>

608
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:38,670
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

609
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,200
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep meddling with human lives?</font>

610
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,570
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak almost died today.</font>

611
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:43,940
<font color="yellow">If that is her destiny, it can't be avoided.</font>

612
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:44,970
<font color="yellow">Says who?</font>

613
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,340

<font color="yellow">I foresaw the accident a few days ago,</font>

621
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,840
<font color="yellow">And this accident would've definitely killed her.</font>

622
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,700
<font color="yellow">It's because the accident you foresaw wasn't part of her destiny.</font>

623
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:20,340
<font color="yellow">She became the variable of the accident.</font>

624
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,740
<font color="yellow">Because you were going to save her.</font>

625
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:25,400
<font color="yellow">Thanks to the missing soul who has a goblin boyfriend,</font>

<font color="yellow">Will you please consider returning to ashes?</font>

630
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:45,370
<font color="yellow">It was a joke. No need to take it so seriously.</font>

631
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,470
<font color="yellow">What does it mean to return to ashes?</font>

632
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:54,670
<font color="yellow">Is it like becoming dust, wind, or rain?</font>

633
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,600
<font color="yellow">And being scattered?</font>

634
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,470
<font color="yellow">Why do you even wonder?</font>

635
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,240

00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,400

767
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,790
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

768
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:08,560
<font color="yellow">you'll have to serve Master Kim,</font>

769
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:12,290
<font color="yellow">so you must remember this day clearly.</font>

770
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:13,790
<font color="yellow">Why is he launching lanterns?</font>

771
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,430
<font color="yellow">Who are they?</font>

772
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:16,830
<font color="yellow">They are people...</font>

773
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,700
<font color="yellow">to whom he owed a debt in his heart for a very long time.</font>

774
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,460
<font color="yellow">I heard there is a sword stuck in Uncle's chest. Do you know about it?</font>

775
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,160
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

776
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:35,230
<font color="yellow">You cannot let our master know that you know about it.</font>

777
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:36,330
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

778
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:59,160
<font color="yellow">That sword...</font>

779
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,930
<font color="yellow">is his prize and punishment.</font>

780
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:07,390
<font color="yellow">It is his reason for existing,</font>

781
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:09,930
<font color="yellow">and the clue to his extinction.</font>

782
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:34,430
<font color="yellow">You are my life...</font>

783
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:37,990
<font color="yellow">and my death.</font>

784
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,030
<font color="yellow">And I...</font>

785
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:44,160
<font color="yellow">like you.</font>

786
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,330
<font color="yellow">Thus, I keep this secret...</font>

787
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:53,260
<font color="yellow">and ask above for permission.</font>

788
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:57,160
<font color="yellow">May you not know for one more day.</font>

789
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:00,560
<font color="yellow">May you not know for 100 years more.</font>

790
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:49,490
<font color="yellow">You know me, right?</font>

791
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:52,700
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to you.</font>

792
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:54,700
<font color="yellow">Do you have time?</font>

793
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:57,360
<font color="yellow">Will you please get right to it?</font>

794
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,730
<font color="yellow">I don't feel like speaking with a deity right now.</font>

795
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,560
<font color="yellow">Something went wrong.</font>

796
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:14,560
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

797
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,660
<font color="yellow">it starts with you.</font>

798
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:29,090
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

799
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:32,030
<font color="yellow">This is why...</font>

800
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,490
<font color="yellow">I said even if he doesn't say he's coming,</font>

801
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:37,030
<font color="yellow">I want him to say if he's leaving.</font>

802
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,390
<font color="yellow">What do you want to know?</font>

803
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,130
<font color="yellow">Well, so...</font>

804
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:52,760
<font color="yellow">I told you before.</font>

805
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,630
<font color="yellow">Once my bride appears, I must prepare to go farther away.</font>

806
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:59,660
<font color="yellow">Something seemed strange.</font>

807
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:02,430
<font color="yellow">You know the sword in the goblin's chest.</font>

808
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:06,390
<font color="yellow">What happens exactly...</font>

809
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,430
<font color="yellow">if I remove it?</font>

810
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,560
<font color="yellow">He kept saying he's going somewhere.</font>

811
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,660
<font color="yellow">Does that mean you're not leaving?</font>

812
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,760
<font color="yellow">For now.</font>

813
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:19,030
<font color="yellow">I may have to prepare to go farther away.</font>

814
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:20,630
<font color="yellow">Where is that?</font>

815
01:14:30,330 --> 01:14:32,260
<font color="yellow">Remove that sword quickly.</font>

816
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:36,430
<font color="yellow">Remove the sword and return to ashes.</font>

817
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:41,990
<font color="yellow">You show up out of the blue and tell me to die.</font>

818
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:45,160
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you tell me why...</font>

819
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,030
<font color="yellow">You've lived long enough,</font>

820
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,530
<font color="yellow">but not her.</font>

821
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:53,700
<font color="yellow">I was truly happy when I created her,</font>

822
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,730
<font color="yellow">so decide now.</font>

823
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:01,430
<font color="yellow">How ironic.</font>

824
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:05,790
<font color="yellow">I don't know what decision you want me to make.</font>

825
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:09,790
<font color="yellow">When I was first born as Kim Shin,</font>

826
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:11,760
<font color="yellow">you must have created me.</font>

827
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:14,730
<font color="yellow">Am I not your child?</font>

828
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:16,890
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm telling you.</font>

829
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:20,090
<font color="yellow">For my child, Kim Shin, for whom I wished happiness.</font>

830
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:23,760
<font color="yellow">Because it is what you want the most.</font>

831
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,090
<font color="yellow">- What do I want? - You want her to live.</font>

832
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,030
<font color="yellow">If you don't return to ashes,</font>

833
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,700
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak will die.</font>

834
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,890
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

835
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:40,430
<font color="yellow">he wanted to die.</font>

836
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:44,060
<font color="yellow">That's why he wanted me to be his bride...</font>

837
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:47,560
<font color="yellow">and remove that sword?</font>

838
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:55,130
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

839
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,390
<font color="yellow">if I remove that sword,</font>

840
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:03,960
<font color="yellow">he will die?</font>

841
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:09,560
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

842
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,330
<font color="yellow">if I remove that sword,</font>

843
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:20,060
<font color="yellow">he will disappear...</font>

844
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:23,230
<font color="yellow">from this world? For good?</font>

845
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:38,360
<font color="yellow">She was born to pull out your sword. That's her fate.</font>

846
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:41,160
<font color="yellow">No, you gave her that fate.</font>

847
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:49,460
<font color="yellow">She'll become useless if she doesn't do what she was born to do.</font>

848
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:51,430
<font color="yellow">There will be no reason for her existence.</font>

849
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,460
<font color="yellow">Hence, if she fails to pull out the sword,</font>

850
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,830
<font color="yellow">she'll continue to face death.</font>

851
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,660
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it happened numerous times already.</font>

852
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:01,700
<font color="yellow">- No. - You little.</font>

853
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,130
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

854
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,660
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

855
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:13,830
<font color="yellow">There will be worse accidents.</font>

856
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,330
<font color="yellow">It'll be more frequent and more severe than before.</font>

857
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:21,730
<font color="yellow">You almost killed her once...</font>

858
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:23,530
<font color="yellow">with your own hands.</font>

859
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:26,060
<font color="yellow">It's moving.</font>

860
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,260
<font color="yellow">One day after 100 years...</font>

861
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:49,730
<font color="yellow">When the weather is good enough,</font>

862
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,660
<font color="yellow">I hope I'll be able to...</font>

863
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,130
<font color="yellow">tell her she was my first love.</font>

864
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:00,490
<font color="yellow">I ask...</font>

865
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:03,660
<font color="yellow">above for permission.</font>

866
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:46,560
<font color="yellow">(Goblin)</font>
