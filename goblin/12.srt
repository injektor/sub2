1
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,140
<font color="yellow">He's a new face.</font>

2
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,710
<font color="yellow">He's the one who has been roaming about for a long time.</font>

3
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,240
<font color="yellow">Oh, that one.</font>

4
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,640
<font color="yellow">20 years ago,</font>

5
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,240
<font color="yellow">he even escaped from a grim reaper after confronting one.</font>

6
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,870
<font color="yellow">I think it's been about 20 years.</font>

7
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,740
<font color="yellow">I came across a deceased soul...</font>

8
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,070
<font color="yellow">and I had no information on it.</font>

9
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,040
<font color="yellow">Really? I had a similar experience when I was nine...</font>

10
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,710
<font color="yellow">It seemed like it had been roaming about for a long time.</font>

11
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,970
<font color="yellow">It seemed fearless.</font>

12
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,770
<font color="yellow">I never saw a deceased soul who didn't fear a grim reaper.</font>

13
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,040
<font color="yellow">I thought it was strange.</font>

14
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,910
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you.</font>

15
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,780
<font color="yellow">So you are the goblin's bride.</font>

16
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,280
<font color="yellow">Yes, same here.</font>

17
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,010
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't make yourselves at home in someone's place of business.</font>

18
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,610
<font color="yellow">You'll keep the customers from coming.</font>

19
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,840
<font color="yellow">It's time to do business, so please leave.</font>

20
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,070
<font color="yellow">Cold-hearted brat.</font>

21
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,340
<font color="yellow">You first. Hurry.</font>

22
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,110
<font color="yellow">Unfriendly brat!</font>

23
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,870
<font color="yellow">He felt...</font>

24
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,640
<font color="yellow">In my 20 years of seeing ghosts,</font>

25
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,970
<font color="yellow">I've never seen anything like it.</font>

26
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,040
<font color="yellow">Let's forget.</font>

27
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,070
<font color="yellow">I'm too busy to think about ghosts.</font>

28
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,070
<font color="yellow">If I take all the classes within four days,</font>

29
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,440
<font color="yellow">I'll have to start work later.</font>

30
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,670
<font color="yellow">Like this?</font>

31
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,370
<font color="yellow">A love letter? You're so annoying.</font>

32
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,770
<font color="yellow">I'm too busy just trying to survive, and you wrote a love letter?</font>

33
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,870
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

34
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,640
<font color="yellow">a grim reaper.</font>

35
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,440
<font color="yellow">I want to see him.</font>

36
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,170
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see him.</font>

37
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,040
<font color="yellow">I want to see him.</font>

38
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,570
<font color="yellow">How is it always exactly seven shots?</font>

39
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,370
<font color="yellow">I know it'll end exactly after seven shots,</font>

40
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,940
<font color="yellow">but started with "I want to see him."</font>

41
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,910
<font color="yellow">I want to see him.</font>

42
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,970
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see him.</font>

43
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,510
<font color="yellow">I want to see him.</font>

44
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,510
<font color="yellow">Have you ever been hit by peach flowers?</font>

45
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,770
<font color="yellow">I have.</font>

46
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,210
<font color="yellow">I got a beating at a shaman's house.</font>

47
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,010
<font color="yellow">That scars for a while.</font>

48
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,240
<font color="yellow">The previous ones were better.</font>

49
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,340
<font color="yellow">Right? They were, right?</font>

50
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,840
<font color="yellow">Have you...</font>

51
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,770
<font color="yellow">ever wanted to get your memory back?</font>

52
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,410
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

53
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,010
<font color="yellow">What is a memory you've forgotten?</font>

54
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,070
<font color="yellow">It's like a memory that you never had.</font>

55
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,340
<font color="yellow">You never had it anyway, so why?</font>

56
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,910
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

57
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,940
<font color="yellow">miss it.</font>

58
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,340
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

59
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,470
<font color="yellow">We are all sinners.</font>

60
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,870
<font color="yellow">We don't know what that longing will bring.</font>

61
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,310
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

62
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,040
<font color="yellow">I know it.</font>

63
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,710
<font color="yellow">Each time I long for it,</font>

64
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,970
<font color="yellow">I don't know where it's going to take me,</font>

65
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,670
<font color="yellow">and it dreads me.</font>

66
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,470
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

67
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,710
<font color="yellow">I still miss it.</font>

68
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,940
<font color="yellow">It looks like you're drinking too much today.</font>

69
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,540
<font color="yellow">I got caught. Sunny found out that I am a grim reaper.</font>

70
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,510
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

71
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,640
<font color="yellow">Where did she get...</font>

72
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,140
<font color="yellow">a branch of peach flowers in the middle of winter?</font>

73
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,840
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

74
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,340
<font color="yellow">What do I do now?</font>

75
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,540
<font color="yellow">She must be very confused.</font>

76
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,770
<font color="yellow">What are you worried about?</font>

77
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,740
<font color="yellow">Since you already got caught, you should hold her hands.</font>

78
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,140
<font color="yellow">And see if you see my face.</font>

79
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,710
<font color="yellow">I said I got caught.</font>

80
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,440
<font color="yellow">So casually hold her hand and see if you see me.</font>

81
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,040
<font color="yellow">You are greatly mistaken.</font>

82
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,540
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard it is to see one's past life?</font>

83
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,070
<font color="yellow">It comes to you as if someone is suddenly pushing it inside you.</font>

84
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,270
<font color="yellow">When the lady in the picture came to life, she was so beautiful.</font>

85
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,770
<font color="yellow">And her beauty totally made me go mad.</font>

86
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,040
<font color="yellow">She's my sister.</font>

87
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,710
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

88
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,710
<font color="yellow">I did see one young and foolish face.</font>

89
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,870
<font color="yellow">It was that young king.</font>

90
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,440
<font color="yellow">My foolish sister must've only thought about him.</font>

91
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,270
<font color="yellow">She doesn't care about her brother at all.</font>

92
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,970
<font color="yellow">I'm here. What is it?</font>

93
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,170
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. I'll come next time.</font>

94
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,240
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. Don't look at my notebook.</font>

95
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,540
<font color="yellow">Why did you write about me then?</font>

96
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,170
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

97
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,170
<font color="yellow">Did you forge a document again behind my back?</font>

98
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,340
<font color="yellow">Stop pretending not to know what it is.</font>

99
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,040
<font color="yellow">It's a love letter. It's a love letter you wrote.</font>

100
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,370
<font color="yellow">Did he write a love letter?</font>

101
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,740
<font color="yellow">He did for his first love.</font>

102
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,340
<font color="yellow">I wanted to know how it ended and see how special it was.</font>

103
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,870
<font color="yellow">I was going to ask for your help.</font>

104
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,610
<font color="yellow">Do you know what it's about? It's not a love letter.</font>

105
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,940
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

106
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,770
<font color="yellow">It was very well-written.</font>

107
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,070
<font color="yellow">"One day after 100 years..."</font>

108
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,870
<font color="yellow">"When the weather is good enough."</font>

109
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,970
<font color="yellow">- That's not it. - That is it.</font>

110
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,910
<font color="yellow">Deok Hwa read everything to me.</font>

111
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,240
<font color="yellow">"One day after 100 years..."</font>

112
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,040
<font color="yellow">"When the weather is good enough."</font>

113
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,140
<font color="yellow">That's impossible.</font>

114
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,640
<font color="yellow">Deok Hwa could never read this.</font>

115
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,240
<font color="yellow">That wasn't written anywhere.</font>

116
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,040
<font color="yellow">I've been keeping it to myself.</font>

117
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,070
<font color="yellow">One day after 100 years...</font>

118
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,840
<font color="yellow">When the weather is good enough,</font>

119
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,210
<font color="yellow">I hope I'll be able to...</font>

120
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,110
<font color="yellow">tell her she was my first love.</font>

121
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,740
<font color="yellow">Right. That's not it.</font>

122
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,710
<font color="yellow">That can't be right.</font>

123
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,170
<font color="yellow">Deok Hwa interpreted it for me.</font>

124
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,240
<font color="yellow">It's a love letter.</font>

125
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,140
<font color="yellow">When...</font>

126
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,010
<font color="yellow">you blew away tens of cars,</font>

127
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,510
<font color="yellow">did you tell Deok Hwa...</font>

128
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,410
<font color="yellow">that I could help people forget?</font>

129
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

130
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,540
<font color="yellow">Come with me.</font>

131
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,710
<font color="yellow">How did he know and...</font>

132
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,310
<font color="yellow">ask me to come along?</font>

133
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,470
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

134
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:31,010
<font color="yellow">Deok Hwa found me the maple leaf.</font>

135
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,870
<font color="yellow">I had lost it.</font>

136
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,810
<font color="yellow">Guess where this leaf is from.</font>

137
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,470
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

138
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,940
<font color="yellow">That's impressive.</font>

139
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,210
<font color="yellow">Why didn't I realize sooner?</font>

140
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,140
<font color="yellow">He even dared to put the goblin's house in the market.</font>

141
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,770
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it was the king, the divinity, or me.</font>

142
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,110
<font color="yellow">This letter means "to hear".</font>

143
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,410
<font color="yellow">I found her, She's at the ski resort right now.</font>

144
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,240
<font color="yellow">That's because your boss was his sister in their past lives.</font>

145
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,110
<font color="yellow">Shall we...</font>

146
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,170
<font color="yellow">have a drink?</font>

147
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,370
<font color="yellow">Finally, the goblin met the goblin's bride.</font>

148
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,840
<font color="yellow">It's a destiny.</font>

149
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,610
<font color="yellow">What about Yeo?</font>

150
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,410
<font color="yellow">How could you make them meet?</font>

151
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,810
<font color="yellow">One with a sword in his chest and the man who did it to him.</font>

152
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,140
<font color="yellow">What brings you to my house?</font>

153
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,140
<font color="yellow">Do you live here?</font>

154
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,010
<font color="yellow">That's a destiny too.</font>

155
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,510
<font color="yellow">He was looking for a house anyway.</font>

156
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,240
<font color="yellow">You need to take down a notch.</font>

157
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,910
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you thinking?</font>

158
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,770
<font color="yellow">I love him particularly.</font>

159
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,540
<font color="yellow">It's been 900 years since Kim Shin has been punished.</font>

160
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,540
<font color="yellow">Is that still not enough?</font>

161
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,040
<font color="yellow">That's how substantial one's life is.</font>

162
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,910
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you create a perfect world...</font>

163
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,810
<font color="yellow">without a sin in the first place?</font>

164
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,410
<font color="yellow">Then nobody would look for the almighty.</font>

165
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,170
<font color="yellow">Every child was conceived with love.</font>

166
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,340
<font color="yellow">Stop torturing them.</font>

167
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,670
<font color="yellow">Get rid of the hands that are covering his eyes.</font>

168
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,340
<font color="yellow">Let them recognize each other.</font>

169
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,010
<font color="yellow">Let them make their own decision.</font>

170
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,140
<font color="yellow">It's too bad.</font>

171
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,040
<font color="yellow">I loved him for his good looks.</font>

172
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,640
<font color="yellow">They are finally here.</font>

173
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,340
<font color="yellow">Deok Hwa.</font>

174
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,810
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

175
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,510
<font color="yellow">Let's introduce each other.</font>

176
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,640
<font color="yellow">Please, no...</font>

177
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,910
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

178
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,140
<font color="yellow">Don't pray to anyone. The almighty is not listening.</font>

179
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,610
<font color="yellow">"The almighty is still not listening."</font>

180
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,770
<font color="yellow">You were whining.</font>

181
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,040
<font color="yellow">"The almighty must have had his reason for erasing my memory."</font>

182
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,710
<font color="yellow">I will live whether or not I remember my memories.</font>

183
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,240
<font color="yellow">The almighty must have his reasons.</font>

184
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,670
<font color="yellow">You were guessing my intention.</font>

185
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,640
<font color="yellow">I was always listening.</font>

186
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,210
<font color="yellow">You were pleading for death, so I gave you a chance.</font>

187
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,480
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

188
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,840
<font color="yellow">why are you still alive?</font>

189
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,270
<font color="yellow">I never erased your memory.</font>

190
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,370
<font color="yellow">You chose to have your memory erased and yet,</font>

191
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,240
<font color="yellow">you think it's the almighty's plan or mistake?</font>

192
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,640
<font color="yellow">The almighty simply questions.</font>

193
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
<font color="yellow">Fate is the question I throw.</font>

194
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

195
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,670
<font color="yellow">can find the answer.</font>

196
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,510
<font color="yellow">You can say bye...</font>

197
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,540
<font color="yellow">to this boy too.</font>

198
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,370
<font color="yellow">Well, then.</font>

199
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,310
<font color="yellow">I'll get going then.</font>

200
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,640
<font color="yellow">Why are you two here?</font>

201
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,670
<font color="yellow">When did you come?</font>

202
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,270
<font color="yellow">Why am I on the floor?</font>

203
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,110
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

204
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,740
<font color="yellow">Did I just black out?</font>

205
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,210
<font color="yellow">But I just had one drink.</font>

206
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,340
<font color="yellow">Whoever you are,</font>

207
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,370
<font color="yellow">let me hit you once.</font>

208
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,010
<font color="yellow">Why would you hit him?</font>

209
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,940
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have anything to do with it.</font>

210
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,340
<font color="yellow">Are you siding with him?</font>

211
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I kept asking you to go somewhere with me.</font>

212
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,910
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

213
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,940
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

214
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,640
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

215
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,740
<font color="yellow">Are you really Deok Hwa?</font>

216
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,440
<font color="yellow">He's a butterfly. A butterfly.</font>

217
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,540
<font color="yellow">You must be drunk.</font>

218
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,010
<font color="yellow">Come here. Come here!</font>

219
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,970
<font color="yellow">Let go of me. Let me talk to him.</font>

220
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,440
<font color="yellow">Let go of me. Let go.</font>

221
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,410
<font color="yellow">It's hot. It's hot.</font>

222
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,040
<font color="yellow">It's really good.</font>

223
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,640
<font color="yellow">It turns out he's a grim reaper.</font>

224
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,740
<font color="yellow">How did you find out?</font>

225
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,170
<font color="yellow">I witnessed a very strange moment.</font>

226
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,910
<font color="yellow">We happened...</font>

227
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,270
<font color="yellow">to cross paths a few times in my life.</font>

228
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,210
<font color="yellow">Sorry I didn't tell you.</font>

229
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,070
<font color="yellow">For a grim reaper, Woo Bin's...</font>

230
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,270
<font color="yellow">really sweet, gentle, and...</font>

231
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,270
<font color="yellow">Does he have a clingy ghost ex-girlfriend?</font>

232
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,040
<font color="yellow">That was the first thought I had.</font>

233
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,610
<font color="yellow">We aren't a good match. I'm way out of his league.</font>

234
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,010
<font color="yellow">We live in two separate worlds.</font>

235
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,770
<font color="yellow">How did you think of that?</font>

236
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,040
<font color="yellow">I even had this thought.</font>

237
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,210
<font color="yellow">If he's a grim reaper, then the man who says he's my brother...</font>

238
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,910
<font color="yellow">must have really lived for nearly 1,000 years.</font>

239
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,670
<font color="yellow">Is that true? Are you the wife of the goblin?</font>

240
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,470
<font color="yellow">Technically speaking, I am his wife,</font>

241
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,040
<font color="yellow">but I'm the breadwinner.</font>

242
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,870
<font color="yellow">This is insane.</font>

243
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,040
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

244
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,470
<font color="yellow">Even if you hang out outside of our house,</font>

245
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,170
<font color="yellow">it's very unlikely that you'll see Woo Bin.</font>

246
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,340
<font color="yellow">He works late very often.</font>

247
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,810
<font color="yellow">Give him a call.</font>

248
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,640
<font color="yellow">How can I when he suggested we break up?</font>

249
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,410
<font color="yellow">I'd force myself to take his call if he were to contact me first.</font>

250
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,110
<font color="yellow">Just play along.</font>

251
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,340
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

252
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,340
<font color="yellow">Boss, I'm really sorry but...</font>

253
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,070
<font color="yellow">Sure, do what you want.</font>

254
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,940
<font color="yellow">I didn't say anything yet.</font>

255
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,670
<font color="yellow">You're in college now and you want to work different hours.</font>

256
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,070
<font color="yellow">That's incredible.</font>

257
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:18,470
<font color="yellow">You're a real human being, right?</font>

258
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,470
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

259
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,770
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since I got startled by a human.</font>

260
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,470
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

261
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,610
<font color="yellow">Why are we eating chicken anyway?</font>

262
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,040
<font color="yellow">The owner lives in the flat beneath mine.</font>

263
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,070
<font color="yellow">We should help our neighbours.</font>

264
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,140
<font color="yellow">Let's eat up and get going.</font>

265
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,070
<font color="yellow">Early January is the busiest time of year.</font>

266
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,470
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your meal.</font>

267
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,470
<font color="yellow">We didn't order this.</font>

268
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,510
<font color="yellow">It's on the house. It's a new menu. You guys have a tough job.</font>

269
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,170
<font color="yellow">Thanks so much for noticing.</font>

270
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,640
<font color="yellow">It tastes delicious.</font>

271
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,340
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

272
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,170
<font color="yellow">- Eat up. - I'll dip it first.</font>

273
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:27,170
<font color="yellow">How dare a ghost appear in front of a grim reaper?</font>

274
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,810
<font color="yellow">It has been a while.</font>

275
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,910
<font color="yellow">I see you have been living as a grim reaper.</font>

276
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:36,070
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Do you know me?</font>

277
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,870
<font color="yellow">- I do. - You can't trick me.</font>

278
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,670
<font color="yellow">Do you not want to know who I am?</font>

279
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,310
<font color="yellow">And why I am so fearless as I stand here before you?</font>

280
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,370
<font color="yellow">But most importantly,</font>

281
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,270
<font color="yellow">do you not want to know who you are?</font>

282
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,740
<font color="yellow">Go and hold the woman's hand.</font>

283
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,270
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about the owner of the restaurant you just left.</font>

284
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,710
<font color="yellow">People who committed serious crimes are born again as grim reapers.</font>

285
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,840
<font color="yellow">She will show you what you did.</font>

286
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,010
<font color="yellow">And also...</font>

287
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,240
<font color="yellow">what part I played in it.</font>

288
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,610
<font color="yellow">I never erased your memory.</font>

289
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,710
<font color="yellow">You chose to have your memory erased and yet,</font>

290
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:34,610
<font color="yellow">you think it's the almighty's plan or mistake?</font>

291
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,870
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking about?</font>

292
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,540
<font color="yellow">Something I shouldn't think about.</font>

293
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,270
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing what you know you shouldn't?</font>

294
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,410
<font color="yellow">If I don't do it today, I might do it tomorrow.</font>

295
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,340
<font color="yellow">Don't do that. It's a bad time.</font>

296
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,770
<font color="yellow">We got a warning from the top because of the Janghang-dong case.</font>

297
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,170
<font color="yellow">What did they say?</font>

298
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,670
<font color="yellow">"Remember that you are sinners."</font>

299
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,040
<font color="yellow">It's so confusing and worrying.</font>

300
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,470
<font color="yellow">Here are this month's name cards.</font>

301
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,610
<font color="yellow">Was I given an answer...</font>

302
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,470
<font color="yellow">or a question?</font>

303
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,140
<font color="yellow">I gave you name cards.</font>

304
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,540
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

305
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,470
<font color="yellow">He has three hours.</font>

306
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,770
<font color="yellow">Cause of death is cardiac arrest.</font>

307
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,170
<font color="yellow">You should say goodbye.</font>

308
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,840
<font color="yellow">I said all I wanted to during our lifetime.</font>

309
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,040
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see him...</font>

310
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,540
<font color="yellow">feel sorry for me or be apologetic.</font>

311
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,040
<font color="yellow">See him off for me.</font>

312
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,370
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

313
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,710
<font color="yellow">Tell him to be born again.</font>

314
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,840
<font color="yellow">In his next life,</font>

315
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,840
<font color="yellow">tell him not to serve any man and to be free.</font>

316
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,070
<font color="yellow">Tell him I thank him.</font>

317
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,470
<font color="yellow">That I was very grateful.</font>

318
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,040
<font color="yellow">What is going on?</font>

319
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:54,170
<font color="yellow">Prepare a black outfit. You'll hear of Chairman Yu's death.</font>

320
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,540
<font color="yellow">Check on him every now and then.</font>

321
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,670
<font color="yellow">You're so mean, you don't know how I feel</font>

322
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,110
<font color="yellow">This is unbearable. My back hurts.</font>

323
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,110
<font color="yellow">Just wait until I'm CEO.</font>

324
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,540
<font color="yellow">I'll come here every day, drag everyone out to dinner,</font>

325
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,540
<font color="yellow">and check their work.</font>

326
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,540
<font color="yellow">I'll compliment your worst outfit and make you wear it forever.</font>

327
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,910
<font color="yellow">- Deok Hwa. - What?</font>

328
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,670
<font color="yellow">Did Grandpa tell you to watch me from up close?</font>

329
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,670
<font color="yellow">You need to come with me. Right now.</font>

330
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,440
<font color="yellow">I don't get off work for hours.</font>

331
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,010
<font color="yellow">I brought your suit. Change in the car.</font>

332
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,540
<font color="yellow">What suit?</font>

333
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,270
<font color="yellow">The man whose every second on this earth was good...</font>

334
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,840
<font color="yellow">Here he rests.</font>

335
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,670
<font color="yellow">Yu Shin Woo.</font>

336
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,740
<font color="yellow">(The man whose every second on this earth was good.)</font>

337
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:00,110
<font color="yellow">(Here he rests. Yu Shin Woo.)</font>

338
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,320
<font color="yellow">So this is what it's like...</font>

339
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,460
<font color="yellow">to be immortal.</font>

340
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:45,420
<font color="yellow">Chairman Yu must keep turning back to look.</font>

341
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,760
<font color="yellow">He'd be worried about you.</font>

342
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,060
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

343
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,720
<font color="yellow">the ones left behind...</font>

344
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,290
<font color="yellow">should live even harder.</font>

345
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,860
<font color="yellow">We might cry from time to time,</font>

346
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,820
<font color="yellow">but we should smile a lot...</font>

347
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,890
<font color="yellow">and cheer up.</font>

348
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,730
<font color="yellow">You're...</font>

349
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,490
<font color="yellow">obligated to do that in return for the love you received.</font>

350
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,990
<font color="yellow">Would you like...</font>

351
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,620
<font color="yellow">something to warm you up?</font>

352
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,160
<font color="yellow">I'll have something...</font>

353
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,060
<font color="yellow">with Deok Hwa when he's back.</font>

354
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,490
<font color="yellow">What do I do now?</font>

355
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,190
<font color="yellow">I didn't get to treat him well.</font>

356
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,390
<font color="yellow">How can he leave me...</font>

357
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,860
<font color="yellow">making me feeling guilty like this?</font>

358
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:18,290
<font color="yellow">How can I keep living while feeling sorry to him?</font>

359
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,160
<font color="yellow">What do I do now?</font>

360
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,690
<font color="yellow">How will I live alone?</font>

361
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,960
<font color="yellow">You're not alone.</font>

362
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,760
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

363
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,990
<font color="yellow">You have me.</font>

364
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,790
<font color="yellow">You and I will be together,</font>

365
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,860
<font color="yellow">so don't worry.</font>

366
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,490
<font color="yellow">Uncle...</font>

367
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,560
<font color="yellow">You should get up and eat something.</font>

368
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,790
<font color="yellow">Come on, these apples look like rabbits.</font>

369
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,590
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to make you gold?</font>

370
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,590
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to walk through walls?</font>

371
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,090
<font color="yellow">Deok Hwa, you can have my camera.</font>

372
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,090
<font color="yellow">I know you wanted it.</font>

373
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:32,120
<font color="yellow">Forget it. My grandpa got it for you.</font>

374
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,520
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in advance.</font>

375
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,060
<font color="yellow">I should have given you time to get yourself together.</font>

376
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,390
<font color="yellow">I regret it.</font>

377
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,590
<font color="yellow">However, there's order in this world.</font>

378
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,690
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

379
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,390
<font color="yellow">We've been tending a goblin for generations.</font>

380
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,490
<font color="yellow">Thank you, everyone.</font>

381
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,090
<font color="yellow">I have to go do something.</font>

382
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,960
<font color="yellow">I thought he might be bothered by this.</font>

383
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,230
<font color="yellow">You know what he's like.</font>

384
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,190
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

385
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,320
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim has been appointed as the CEO.</font>

386
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,190
<font color="yellow">Grandpa had everything prepared before he left.</font>

387
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,190
<font color="yellow">I'm glad.</font>

388
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,890
<font color="yellow">I'm not ready yet.</font>

389
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,620
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

390
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,160
<font color="yellow">I'll start learning the work from the ground up.</font>

391
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,360
<font color="yellow">I bet that's what he would have wanted.</font>

392
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,320
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - I'll also...</font>

393
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,890
<font color="yellow">start learning go.</font>

394
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,090
<font color="yellow">Then I'll become your brother, your father,</font>

395
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,360
<font color="yellow">then your grandfather.</font>

396
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,060
<font color="yellow">Just like my grandfather.</font>

397
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,490
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

398
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,120
<font color="yellow">(Yu Deok Hwa)</font>

399
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,120
<font color="yellow">(Kim Do Young)</font>

400
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,020
<font color="yellow">If someone...</font>

401
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,520
<font color="yellow">by the last name Kim and first name Shin comes to you...</font>

402
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,960
<font color="yellow">and says that he is here to retrieve his belongings,</font>

403
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,090
<font color="yellow">give it to him.</font>

404
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,460
<font color="yellow">All I've left behind belongs to him.</font>

405
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,390
<font color="yellow">He will come to you through rain...</font>

406
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,090
<font color="yellow">and leave as a blue flame.</font>

407
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,260
<font color="yellow">Then you will know it's him.</font>

408
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,160
<font color="yellow">He left, right?</font>

409
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,760
<font color="yellow">Who are... Do you know me?</font>

410
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,790
<font color="yellow">I do. A kid who is nothing but nice.</font>

411
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,520
<font color="yellow">That's why you light up this world.</font>

412
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,590
<font color="yellow">Remember, your good-nature is what will bring you luck.</font>

413
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,260
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

414
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,760
<font color="yellow">I'm not a kid, though.</font>

415
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,890
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go for a drink?</font>

416
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,360
<font color="yellow">You can go drinking with someone beautiful.</font>

417
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,490
<font color="yellow">You are beautiful.</font>

418
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,360
<font color="yellow">You should drink with a human.</font>

419
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,490
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

420
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,260
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

421
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,190
<font color="yellow">Why are you making so much?</font>

422
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,460
<font color="yellow">Deok Hwa is coming.</font>

423
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,360
<font color="yellow">Pass me the pepper.</font>

424
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,790
<font color="yellow">I'm jealous of Deok Hwa. He has an uncle.</font>

425

<font color="yellow">Don't mind me.</font>

426
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:29,860
<font color="yellow">I'm jealous of everyone and I feel empty these days.</font>

427
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,120
<font color="yellow">Just tell me right out.</font>

428
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,520
<font color="yellow">I know you want an uncle like me.</font>

429
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,760
<font color="yellow">A super handsome uncle.</font>

430
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,730
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

431
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,120
<font color="yellow">When did you say you became a grim reaper?</font>

432
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,790
<font color="yellow">Over 300 years ago. Why?</font>

433
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,290
<font color="yellow">Is something on my face?</font>

434
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,560
<font color="yellow">It's just that for a second,</font>

435
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,520
<font color="yellow">I saw a face I didn't see in you before.</font>

436
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,290
<font color="yellow">Who? What kind of face?</font>

437
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,320
<font color="yellow">A face I shouldn't see.</font>

438

<font color="yellow">Hey. Sit, help, or go to your room.</font>

439
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,160
<font color="yellow">Why are you prowling?</font>

440
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,060
<font color="yellow">I'm being proud of you for becoming useful.</font>

<font color="yellow">An heir of a conglomerate...</font>

442
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,820
<font color="yellow">should naturally think that work outside of office hours as training.</font>

443
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,390
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

444
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,090
<font color="yellow">(Kim Woo Sik)</font>

445
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,690

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

448

452
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,590
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

<font color="yellow">Perfect, right?</font>

454
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,790
<font color="yellow">You forgot something.</font>

455
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,090
<font color="yellow">I know what it is.</font>

456
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,230
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure why you would close your eyes.</font>

457
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,260
<font color="yellow">You're perfect now.</font>

458
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,960
<font color="yellow">Is this the one from Canada?</font>

459
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,730
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit touched.</font>

460
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,990
<font color="yellow">By the way, what does this mean?</font>

461
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,360
<font color="yellow">It's French for "Fate ordained by the sky".</font>

462
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,890
<font color="yellow">The absolute destiny far beyond the realm of humanity...</font>

<font color="yellow">That's a word that I like. "Fate".</font>

464
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,360
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

465
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:27,730
<font color="yellow">No blind dates. No romance. No Tae Hee.</font>

<font color="yellow">See? Wasn't that romantic?</font>

544
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,190
<font color="yellow">Why would you pay me back in a small and confined room?</font>

545
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,460
<font color="yellow">You should pay my boss back for the sweet potatoes with that money.</font>

546
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:07,690
<font color="yellow">Did she tell you to urge me?</font>

547
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,220
<font color="yellow">You miss your sister, but my boss is living in the present.</font>

548
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,690
<font color="yellow">It's awkward for you to go see her, but you do miss her. Am I right?</font>

549
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:18,890
<font color="yellow">You could go there to pay her back.</font>

550
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:21,260
<font color="yellow">I'm making you an excuse to go see her.</font>

551
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,990
<font color="yellow">I'm going to work. Do you want to come with me?</font>

552
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,290
<font color="yellow">I do miss her, but she scares me.</font>

553
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,860
<font color="yellow">I'll go some other time.</font>

554
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,020
<font color="yellow">This is amazing. You two are realistic siblings.</font>

<font color="yellow">Let's go out now.</font>

556

557
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:38,890
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

558
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,360
<font color="yellow">It's really cold out.</font>

559
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,160
<font color="yellow">How's school?</font>

560
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,820
<font color="yellow">Do you like it?</font>

561
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,420
<font color="yellow">By the way, Tae Hee is...</font>

562
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,660
<font color="yellow">That son of a...</font>

563
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,190
<font color="yellow">Was I asking about him? I was asking about school.</font>

564
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:58,190
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

565
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:01,390
<font color="yellow">Tae Hee is going to the US. Major League Baseball.</font>

566
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,020
<font color="yellow">I read that goblins recognize true talent.</font>

567
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,260
<font color="yellow">I was going to say that's really cool.</font>

568
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,620
<font color="yellow">I don't want to brag,</font>

569
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,890
<font color="yellow">but I've been able to recognize true talent for a long time.</font>

570
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,620
<font color="yellow">Hwang Hui was the most significant one.</font>

571
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,660
<font color="yellow">Maeng Sa Sung was something, too.</font>

572
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,260
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

573
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,360
<font color="yellow">A grown-up is talking here.</font>

574
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,890
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid I'm a busy person.</font>

575
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,090
<font color="yellow">I'm late for work.</font>

576
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:29,890
<font color="yellow">Look where we are. What are you rambling on about?</font>

577
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,390
<font color="yellow">I'm off to work.</font>

578
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,160
<font color="yellow">Okay. Call me if anything.</font>

579
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,190
<font color="yellow">This is awkward in this small and confined space.</font>

580
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,090
<font color="yellow">Wait, those two mean the same thing.</font>

581
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,220
<font color="yellow">I want to come here every day.</font>

582
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,890
<font color="yellow">Wind bomb.</font>

583
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,590
<font color="yellow">Come over here.</font>

584
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,760
<font color="yellow">It's late. Go straight home.</font>

585
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,120
<font color="yellow">Your grandma is waiting.</font>

586
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,290
<font color="yellow">We meet again.</font>

587
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,660
<font color="yellow">Back there, I did not properly introduce myself.</font>

588
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,120
<font color="yellow">I am Park Joong Won.</font>

589
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:56,190
<font color="yellow">You look like you know who I am already.</font>

590
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,190
<font color="yellow">I do not.</font>

591
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:02,990
<font color="yellow">Kim Shin.</font>

592
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,720
<font color="yellow">Did he not tell you...</font>

593
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,960
<font color="yellow">that he is the one who killed me?</font>

594
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,320
<font color="yellow">The punishment that was given him...</font>

595
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,360
<font color="yellow">grows in weight like life.</font>

596
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:19,760
<font color="yellow">The price of my life is in there as well.</font>

597
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:28,990
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

598
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,690
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

599
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,020
<font color="yellow">I just want to tell you an interesting story.</font>

600
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:38,960
<font color="yellow">Since you know me, you must know Yeo as well.</font>

601
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,660
<font color="yellow">The sword in Kim Shin's chest...</font>

602
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,890
<font color="yellow">was put there by Wang Yeo.</font>

603
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:47,590
<font color="yellow">The start and end of this tragic fate...</font>

604
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,760
<font color="yellow">was Wang Yeo.</font>

605
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,820
<font color="yellow">Do you know with whom Yeo now lives?</font>

606
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,460
<font color="yellow">How could I know?</font>

607
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,560
<font color="yellow">Yeo is living...</font>

608
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:07,190
<font color="yellow">with Kim Shin right now.</font>

609
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,220
<font color="yellow">That's absurd.</font>

610
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:32,910
<font color="yellow">That is correct.</font>

611
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,810
<font color="yellow">The nameless grim reaper.</font>

612
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,540
<font color="yellow">He is Wang Yeo.</font>

613
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,660
<font color="yellow">What do you think will happen...</font>

614
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,220
<font color="yellow">if the two of them recognize each other?</font>

615
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:50,350
<font color="yellow">Whether or not Kim Shin kills me...</font>

616
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:53,050
<font color="yellow">all depends on you now,</font>

617
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:56,380
<font color="yellow">as his death is in your hands.</font>

618
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:03,850
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it, you control death.</font>

619
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,350
<font color="yellow">You're wrong.</font>

620
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,450
<font color="yellow">The grim reaper that we know has a name.</font>

621
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,750
<font color="yellow">Kim Woo Bin.</font>

622
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:28,210
<font color="yellow">Did you ask what it is that I want?</font>

623
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:32,380
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

624
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,710
<font color="yellow">want their demise.</font>

625
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,380
<font color="yellow">Get out of the way. One for the couple.</font>

626
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,550
<font color="yellow">No way. I sat down here first.</font>

627
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,310
<font color="yellow">Yeo is living...</font>

628
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,780
<font color="yellow">with Kim Shin right now.</font>

629
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:37,010
<font color="yellow">This is insane.</font>

630
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,350
<font color="yellow">Missing Soul.</font>

631
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,750
<font color="yellow">What? Darn it.</font>

632
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,450
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

633
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,950
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for startling you.</font>

634
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:58,210
<font color="yellow">Why are you here? Did you come on purpose?</font>

635
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,380
<font color="yellow">I felt trapped.</font>

636
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,650
<font color="yellow">I had no one else to talk to.</font>

637
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,750
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

638
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,510
<font color="yellow">Is it about my boss?</font>

639
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,280
<font color="yellow">This and that.</font>

640
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:18,080
<font color="yellow">They say if you commit a great sin in your prior life,</font>

641
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,510
<font color="yellow">you become a grim per.</font>

642
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,480
<font color="yellow">What sin?</font>

643
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:28,880
<font color="yellow">I don't know, either.</font>

644
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,710
<font color="yellow">But I think...</font>

645
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,010
<font color="yellow">I may have been in Shin and...</font>

646
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,310
<font color="yellow">his sister's history.</font>

647
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:46,880
<font color="yellow">There are three people who committed great sins in history around then.</font>

648
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:50,950
<font color="yellow">Kim Shin, who cut off the heads of the enemies.</font>

649
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,880
<font color="yellow">Wang Yeo, who ordered the death of Kim Shin...</font>

650
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,480
<font color="yellow">and his sister.</font>

651
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,510
<font color="yellow">And the one who led...</font>

652
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,110
<font color="yellow">Kim Shin and his sister to their grave...</font>

653
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:08,280
<font color="yellow">Park Joong Won.</font>

654
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:12,650
<font color="yellow">Kim Shin is still alive.</font>

655
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,750
<font color="yellow">and Kim Sun was reincarnated as Sunny.</font>

656
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:21,710
<font color="yellow">That means I am Wang Yeo...</font>

657
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:25,810
<font color="yellow">or Park Joong Won.</font>

658
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,780
<font color="yellow">That's is all I've thought about.</font>

659
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,310
<font color="yellow">The nameless grim reaper.</font>

660
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:35,480
<font color="yellow">He is Wang Yeo.</font>

661
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:38,410
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

662
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,950
<font color="yellow">regardless of which one I am,</font>

663
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:47,580
<font color="yellow">I am Shin's enemy, aren't I?</font>

664
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:53,050
<font color="yellow">Regardless of which one I am,</font>

665
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:58,010
<font color="yellow">Sunny and I...</font>

666
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,180
<font color="yellow">cannot be, right?</font>

667
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:24,450
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. I almost hit you.</font>

668
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:27,310
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Did I startle you?</font>

669
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,950
<font color="yellow">Yes, a little.</font>

670
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,150
<font color="yellow">Sorry, but we're closed.</font>

671
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:34,680
<font color="yellow">You're right. Okay then.</font>

672
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:36,680
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

673
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:46,510
<font color="yellow">Okay. Come back another time.</font>

674
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,110
<font color="yellow">No. Never.</font>

675
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,650
<font color="yellow">Do not serve her any medicine.</font>

676
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:01,480
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty reigns over his people,</font>

677
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,310
<font color="yellow">and it's said Your Majesty is controlled by a divinity.</font>

678
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:06,510
<font color="yellow">Apparently, this divinity refers to Kim Shin.</font>

679
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,180
<font color="yellow">(Kim Woo Bin)</font>

680
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,050
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

681
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:36,050
<font color="yellow">Let's meet.</font>

682
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,550
<font color="yellow">You wanted to break up.</font>

683
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,880
<font color="yellow">I'm in front of your home.</font>

684
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,480
<font color="yellow">Wait right there. Is he insane?</font>

685
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,010
<font color="yellow">How could you just show up like this?</font>

686
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,710
<font color="yellow">I was home, so I have no makeup on.</font>

687
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,810
<font color="yellow">I came to get my ring back.</font>

688
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:20,150
<font color="yellow">We still have that excuse left.</font>

689
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:28,350
<font color="yellow">Why do you look like that?</font>

690
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:31,210
<font color="yellow">Didn't you come because you missed me?</font>

691
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:34,850
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

692
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:36,950
<font color="yellow">- But? - But...</font>

693
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,680
<font color="yellow">I am afraid I may be...</font>

694
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,210
<font color="yellow">a certain somebody.</font>

695
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,380
<font color="yellow">I take a step back.</font>

696
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,480
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

697
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,050
<font color="yellow">Everything about me is wrong.</font>

698
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,350
<font color="yellow">I sincerely hope that this choice...</font>

699
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,410
<font color="yellow">is the right one.</font>

700
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,150
<font color="yellow">- Don't do this. - As I am not alive,</font>

701
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:09,680
<font color="yellow">I have no name.</font>

702
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,010
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

703
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:14,780
<font color="yellow">asked after me.</font>

704
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,380
<font color="yellow">Thank you for that.</font>

705
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,380
<font color="yellow">I said stop.</font>

706
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,210
<font color="yellow">The kiss of a grim reaper...</font>

707
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:29,280
<font color="yellow">brings back memories of your previous life.</font>

708
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,180
<font color="yellow">I fear what I was...</font>

709
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:37,150
<font color="yellow">in your previous life.</font>

710
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,480
<font color="yellow">But I wish you are left only with good memories.</font>

711
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:45,050
<font color="yellow">I hope that...</font>

712
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:48,980
<font color="yellow">a part of them are memories...</font>

713
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:51,580
<font color="yellow">of your older brother.</font>

714
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:53,280
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

715
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:56,450
<font color="yellow">I hope that he is...</font>

716
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,610
<font color="yellow">Kim Shin.</font>

717
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:44,150
<font color="yellow">Your brother has returned in triumph again.</font>

718
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:46,480
<font color="yellow">Between the two of us,</font>

719
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:48,550
<font color="yellow">whom do you wish to be alive?</font>

720
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,750
<font color="yellow">- Your Majesty. - Answer me.</font>

721
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,880
<font color="yellow">Or have you already made your decision?</font>

722
01:02:56,550 --> 01:03:00,180
<font color="yellow">Of course, whether I live or your brother lives,</font>

723
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:04,050
<font color="yellow">you have nothing to lose.</font>

724
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,250
<font color="yellow">You're a fool, Your Majesty.</font>

725
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:10,010
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die?</font>

726
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:13,180
<font color="yellow">Why are you dressed like that?</font>

727
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:19,080
<font color="yellow">You are already mourning.</font>

728
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,380
<font color="yellow">Bring the queen's jewellery box.</font>

729
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,150
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you wearing anything?</font>

730
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:33,850
<font color="yellow">I did not give you these to keep in a box!</font>

731
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:38,450
<font color="yellow">I can't tell anymore.</font>

732
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,510
<font color="yellow">I don't know if my enemies are the barbarians or your brother.</font>

733
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:43,380
<font color="yellow">Park Joong Won is your enemy.</font>

734
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,980
<font color="yellow">Your brother, the man that the barbarians could not kill...</font>

735
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:07,250
<font color="yellow">I will kill him today.</font>

736
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,350
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty.</font>

737
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,450
<font color="yellow">Your brother's crime...</font>

738
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:12,810
<font color="yellow">will be treason.</font>

739
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,880
<font color="yellow">Wear this ring and greet him...</font>

740
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,980
<font color="yellow">as my queen.</font>

741
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:43,950
<font color="yellow">Whose side are you on?</font>

742
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:48,380
<font color="yellow">Even once, were you ever on my side?</font>

743
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:50,480
<font color="yellow">Even once,</font>

744
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,550
<font color="yellow">did you ever care for me?</font>

745
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:55,050
<font color="yellow">For one second, did you ever...</font>

746
01:04:58,210 --> 01:04:59,350
<font color="yellow">love me?</font>

747
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:12,650
<font color="yellow">Do not side with him.</font>

748
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,250
<font color="yellow">That is...</font>

749
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:20,210
<font color="yellow">the only way you can preserve your life.</font>

750
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:25,880
<font color="yellow">You have to make a choice.</font>

751
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,110
<font color="yellow">Will you live as my woman...</font>

752
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:32,550
<font color="yellow">or will you die...</font>

753
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,410
<font color="yellow">as the traitor's sister?</font>

754
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:42,880
<font color="yellow">The woman who loves you...</font>

755
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,980
<font color="yellow">is the traitor's sister.</font>

756
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,080
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

757
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:37,850
<font color="yellow">What did I see?</font>

758
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:41,520
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

759
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:43,780
<font color="yellow">That was...</font>

760
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,250
<font color="yellow">your past life.</font>

761
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,750
<font color="yellow">Was...</font>

762
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,810
<font color="yellow">Kim Shin...</font>

763
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,880
<font color="yellow">in your past life?</font>

764
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:05,480
<font color="yellow">Was I...</font>

765
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:09,480
<font color="yellow">a part...</font>

766
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:15,050
<font color="yellow">of your past life?</font>

767
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:36,280
<font color="yellow">Can you...</font>

768
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:41,880
<font color="yellow">look into my eyes?</font>

769
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:50,580
<font color="yellow">Leave only the shining, happy memories...</font>

770
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:56,020
<font color="yellow">and forget...</font>

771
01:07:57,810 --> 01:08:01,110
<font color="yellow">all the sad and hard moments.</font>

772
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,810
<font color="yellow">Whether they were in your past life or present...</font>

773
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,450
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

774
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:17,650
<font color="yellow">forget about me.</font>

775
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,880
<font color="yellow">I hope that...</font>

776
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,450
<font color="yellow">you at least have a happy ending.</font>

777
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,480
<font color="yellow">You, over there.</font>

778
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:02,650
<font color="yellow">Why are you staring into my shop again?</font>

779
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:04,580
<font color="yellow">What is it today?</font>

780
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,020
<font color="yellow">An accessory? A biscuit? Socks?</font>

781
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,380
<font color="yellow">I'm not here for that.</font>

782
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:19,150
<font color="yellow">I owe you for the sweet potatoes.</font>

783
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:24,310
<font color="yellow">Let's say that was my treat.</font>

784
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,350
<font color="yellow">So, dear brother.</font>

785
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,550
<font color="yellow">Did the king really say...</font>

786
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,080
<font color="yellow">I was ugly?</font>

787
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,750
<font color="yellow">Even if you're on the battlefield,</font>

788
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,610
<font color="yellow">how can a brother not send his sister a reply?</font>

789
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:07,710
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

790
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,020
<font color="yellow">Are you really...</font>

791
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:15,050
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry it took me this long to recognize you.</font>

792
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,480
<font color="yellow">I promised to become happy,</font>

793
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,750
<font color="yellow">but I couldn't keep it.</font>

794
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:28,450
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

795
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:52,780
<font color="yellow">Persimmon, flowery shoes, and silk.</font>

796
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:54,810
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

797
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,750
<font color="yellow">You must come see me more often from now on.</font>

798
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:46,350
<font color="yellow">Can you help me if you're not too busy?</font>

799
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:05,650
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

800
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:07,050
<font color="yellow">Just...</font>

801
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,610
<font color="yellow">Something is bothering me.</font>

802
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:11,310
<font color="yellow">Did you fight with my uncle again?</font>

803
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:12,350
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

804
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,080
<font color="yellow">Even before that.</font>

805
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:18,310
<font color="yellow">Ever since that day, it's been happening.</font>

806
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:19,880
<font color="yellow">When?</font>

807
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,110
<font color="yellow">What is it? Are you okay?</font>

808
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:51,580
<font color="yellow">That day?</font>

809
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:53,480
<font color="yellow">It couldn't be because of him.</font>

810
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,150
<font color="yellow">We were at a temple then.</font>

811
01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:56,610
<font color="yellow">- A temple? - Yes.</font>

812
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,410
<font color="yellow">He sent up a lantern.</font>

813
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:00,550
<font color="yellow">He does it once a year.</font>

814
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:05,480
<font color="yellow">He does it in remembrance of the people he owes.</font>

815
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,980
<font color="yellow">They had two syllable names.</font>

816
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,650
<font color="yellow">Kim Sun...</font>

817
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:13,480
<font color="yellow">and Wang something.</font>

818
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,810
<font color="yellow">It was in Chinese characters.</font>

819
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:19,950
<font color="yellow">What happens if I do this?</font>

820
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,410
<font color="yellow">A pursued stone.</font>

821
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:30,850
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

822
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,110
<font color="yellow">Look at that.</font>

823
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:35,020
<font color="yellow">She's acting like she can't see me.</font>

824
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:44,110
<font color="yellow">Hey, you little punk!</font>

825
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,710
<font color="yellow">She's not acting.</font>

826
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,950
<font color="yellow">She really can't see me.</font>

827
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,210
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

828
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:18,650
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

829
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:24,250
<font color="yellow">I'm excited to pick you up, too.</font>

830
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:34,310
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy you came to pick me up at school.</font>

831
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,850
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

832
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:40,880
<font color="yellow">I was just thinking about something.</font>

833
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:43,050
<font color="yellow">Did something good happen?</font>

834
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,450
<font color="yellow">You look like it.</font>

835
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:46,050
<font color="yellow">That took you a while to ask.</font>

836
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:49,550
<font color="yellow">My sister, Sun...</font>

837
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:51,350
<font color="yellow">finally remembered me.</font>

838
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:53,480
<font color="yellow">Really? Really?</font>

839
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,210
<font color="yellow">That's great news.</font>

840
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:56,850
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

841
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,210
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask her.</font>

842
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:01,810
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

843
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:03,850
<font color="yellow">How did she remember her previous life?</font>

844
01:16:06,150 --> 01:16:07,350
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

845
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:10,050
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

846
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:13,850
<font color="yellow">Can you...</font>

847
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:16,850
<font color="yellow">pull the car over for a minute?</font>

848
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:25,850
<font color="yellow">Please listen to me...</font>

849
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:28,480
<font color="yellow">without getting upset.</font>

850
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:31,020
<font color="yellow">I've thought about it a lot.</font>

851
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:33,580
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

852
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:37,410
<font color="yellow">I believe that you are someone much bigger...</font>

853
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,380
<font color="yellow">than what I know.</font>

854
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:40,810
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

855
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:44,250
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

856
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,980
<font color="yellow">met someone deceased,</font>

857
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:49,850
<font color="yellow">and I think...</font>

858
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,980
<font color="yellow">it's Park Joong Won.</font>

859
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,750
<font color="yellow">How...</font>

860
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,580
<font color="yellow">do you know Park Joong Won?</font>

861
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:58,880
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

862
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,250
<font color="yellow">but overheard what you said...</font>

863
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:04,150
<font color="yellow">to the Grim Reaper.</font>

864
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,080
<font color="yellow">At first, I thought he was just an evil ghost.</font>

865
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:11,580
<font color="yellow">However, I can't tell what he's after.</font>

866
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,150
<font color="yellow">I feel like strange things happening around me are related to him.</font>

867
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:17,780
<font color="yellow">Maybe Sunny remembering you...</font>

868
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:19,750
<font color="yellow">might be because of him.</font>

869
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,680
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you told me. Thank you.</font>

870
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:24,850
<font color="yellow">I'll drive you home. Stay there and don't go out.</font>

871
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:27,080
<font color="yellow">A goblin's house is the safest place.</font>

872
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:29,150
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

873
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:46,280
<font color="yellow">I avoided you for 900 years. I can't believe I ran into you.</font>

874
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,780
<font color="yellow">How futile.</font>

875
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:52,480
<font color="yellow">Do not worry.</font>

876
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,580
<font color="yellow">I will get rid of you right away.</font>

877
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:57,210
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

878
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:00,950
<font color="yellow">you must tell me why you suddenly showed up...</font>

879
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:04,550
<font color="yellow">after hiding for the last 900 years.</font>

880
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:08,580
<font color="yellow">Despite all those years,</font>

881
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:12,210
<font color="yellow">you have failed to find insight since you are a mere warrior.</font>

882
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:17,380
<font color="yellow">You had your enemy trudge along with you. How pathetic.</font>

883
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,650
<font color="yellow">I will be glad to tell you.</font>

884
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:25,980
<font color="yellow">That tongue of yours is still senile after 900 years.</font>

885
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,250
<font color="yellow">I will pull out your tongue first.</font>

886
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:34,350
<font color="yellow">Then I will cut your body into pieces.</font>

887
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:39,750
<font color="yellow">I will do it right now.</font>

888
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,850
<font color="yellow">You, I or the 900 years.</font>

889
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:09,950
<font color="yellow">You will not be able to hurt me with that sword of yours.</font>

890
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:22,520
<font color="yellow">Did living as a goblin...</font>

891
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:27,650
<font color="yellow">make you think that you actually became the almighty?</font>

892
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:37,880
<font color="yellow">I will kill you no matter what, so do not worry.</font>

893
01:21:04,450 --> 01:21:09,250
<font color="yellow">The longing within makes one die of an unworthy death.</font>

894
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:13,150
<font color="yellow">During the 20 years you spent rotting,</font>

895
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:16,180
<font color="yellow">Yeo grew powerful...</font>

896
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:18,380
<font color="yellow">beyond recognition.</font>

897
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:21,980
<font color="yellow">If you speak of that name one more time...</font>

898
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:26,580
<font color="yellow">Do you know the identity of the grim reaper by your side?</font>

899
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:29,520
<font color="yellow">He's the man who gave you that sword...</font>

900
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,610
<font color="yellow">and the one who pierced your heart with it.</font>

901
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:36,980
<font color="yellow">That man is...</font>

902
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:39,650
<font color="yellow">Wang Yeo.</font>

903
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:43,710
<font color="yellow">Ludicrous.</font>

904
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:46,810
<font color="yellow">Your foolish sister...</font>

905
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:49,150
<font color="yellow">fell for him again in this life.</font>

906
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,350
<font color="yellow">I pity you.</font>

907
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:59,880
<font color="yellow">You will never have your revenge.</font>

908
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:11,950
<font color="yellow">I heard you cried.</font>

909
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:14,810
<font color="yellow">Why? Even I don't cry.</font>

910
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:17,710
<font color="yellow">Who is the woman in the painting by the way?</font>

911
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:21,880
<font color="yellow">I don't remember. I just feel.</font>

912
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:25,780
<font color="yellow">I was just extremely sad.</font>

913
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,280
<font color="yellow">My heart felt like it was breaking.</font>

914
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,520
<font color="yellow">A super handsome uncle.</font>

915
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:41,580
<font color="yellow">Have you seen a ring like this?</font>

916
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:34,950
<font color="yellow">Is the grim reaper in your previous life?</font>

917
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:39,080
<font color="yellow">- Have you seen him? - Excuse me.</font>

918
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:42,810
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing in my restaurant?</font>

919
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:46,580
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm really Kim Sun because I remember my past life?</font>

920
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:47,880
<font color="yellow">Is that man...</font>

921
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,410
<font color="yellow">really Yeo?</font>

922
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:59,750
<font color="yellow">- I have to go home. - I asked you a question.</font>

923
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,780
<font color="yellow">Even in this life,</font>

924
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,380
<font color="yellow">you are...</font>

925
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:20,410
<font color="yellow">protecting that fool.</font>

926
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:57,050
<font color="yellow">Was I?</font>

927
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:02,010
<font color="yellow">Was I really Wang Yeo?</font>

928
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:05,710
<font color="yellow">The feelings without memories...</font>

929
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,480
<font color="yellow">Is that...</font>

930
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:12,350
<font color="yellow">the punishment I gave myself...</font>

931
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:15,580
<font color="yellow">so I won't forget who I was?</font>

932
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:53,410
<font color="yellow">As expected,</font>

933
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:57,380
<font color="yellow">it looks like I'm the worst memory.</font>

934
01:26:59,050 --> 01:27:00,880
<font color="yellow">To you...</font>

935
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:05,510
