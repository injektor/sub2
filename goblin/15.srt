<font color="yellow">Oh, you again.</font>

4
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,060
<font color="yellow">I'll say.</font>

5
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,500
<font color="yellow">"I'll say"?</font>

6
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,340
<font color="yellow">Is that what I just said?</font>

7
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,500
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

8
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,380
<font color="yellow">Lady.</font>

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,180
<font color="yellow">- Me? - It's good to see you here.</font>

10
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,580
<font color="yellow">- Do you know me? - No.</font>

11
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,780
<font color="yellow">But that necklace you're wearing.</font>

12
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,300
<font color="yellow">- This? - I made that.</font>

13
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,340
<font color="yellow">A man asked me to design it.</font>

14
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,900
<font color="yellow">Must have been 10 years ago.</font>

15
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,900
<font color="yellow">10 years? What man?</font>

16
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,100
<font color="yellow">You should know better.</font>

17
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,260
<font color="yellow">You're the owner of the necklace.</font>

18
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,100
<font color="yellow">Do you know what it means?</font>

19
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,820
<font color="yellow">- No. - It means...</font>

20
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,900
<font color="yellow">"a match made in Heaven" in French.</font>

21
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,820
<font color="yellow">Destiny made outside of man's boundary.</font>

22
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,140
<font color="yellow">Are you living happily with the man who gave you that necklace?</font>

23
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,740
<font color="yellow">Will you stop? You're out of places to try.</font>

24
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,020
<font color="yellow">There's one place I haven't tried.</font>

25
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,860
<font color="yellow">The place she's at.</font>

26
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,900
<font color="yellow">Then go. I give my permission.</font>

27
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,220
<font color="yellow">Can I go?</font>

28
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,180
<font color="yellow">Would it be okay to cause her confusion?</font>

29
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,060
<font color="yellow">Is it okay to confuse me? I'm on edge because of you.</font>

30
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,580
<font color="yellow">I feel so empty inside.</font>

31
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,260
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

32
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,740
<font color="yellow">He lived for a long time, too.</font>

33
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,100
<font color="yellow">Put that back before you cause an international dispute.</font>

34
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,780
<font color="yellow">He wants us gone.</font>

35
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,740
<font color="yellow">He's scary when he's angry.</font>

36
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,940
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is just so weird.</font>

37
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,740
<font color="yellow">How could we meet here?</font>

38
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,820
<font color="yellow">I'm on a business trip. I'm here to research...</font>

39
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,100
<font color="yellow">designs to put on the corners of our furniture.</font>

40
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,340
<font color="yellow">- What are you on about? - I don't know.</font>

41
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,020
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

42
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,620
<font color="yellow">Are you following me?</font>

43
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,140
<font color="yellow">Is that a crime?</font>

44
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,540
<font color="yellow">- What should I do? - I'm not a bad man.</font>

45
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,620
<font color="yellow">How would I know that?</font>

46
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,980
<font color="yellow">By spending time with me.</font>

47
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,140
<font color="yellow">I have no reason to do that.</font>

48
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,420
<font color="yellow">My company sponsored your radio show.</font>

49
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,580
<font color="yellow">You offered to buy me a meal.</font>

50
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,780
<font color="yellow">Is this your first time in Canada?</font>

51
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,900
<font color="yellow">Let's go this way.</font>

52
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,580
<font color="yellow">Did I tell you I'd be in Canada?</font>

53
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,100
<font color="yellow">- Didn't I just say I'd go abroad? - I think you mentioned Canada.</font>

54
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,860
<font color="yellow">You said something about maple leaves.</font>

55
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,220
<font color="yellow">Maple leaves?</font>

56
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,140
<font color="yellow">I remember that.</font>

57
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,580
<font color="yellow">Let's go this way.</font>

58
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,220
<font color="yellow">Is this enough?</font>

59
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,580
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

60
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,940
<font color="yellow">It's nice like we're on a picnic.</font>

61
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,980
<font color="yellow">Not for you, for me.</font>

62
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,100
<font color="yellow">Is this enough for me?</font>

63
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,900
<font color="yellow">Remember how much I sponsored your show with?</font>

64
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,140
<font color="yellow">The thing is,</font>

65
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,820
<font color="yellow">this trip was sudden, not planned.</font>

66
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,820
<font color="yellow">I didn't bring that much money.</font>

67
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,060
<font color="yellow">- What do you like? - Beef.</font>

68
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,300
<font color="yellow">I'm not much of a meat-eater.</font>

69
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,740
<font color="yellow">You love it.</font>

70
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,300
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

71
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,140
<font color="yellow">Well... Who doesn't like meat?</font>

72
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,060
<font color="yellow">Don't avoid my question.</font>

73
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,380
<font color="yellow">Did you have someone dig up my information?</font>

74
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,580
<font color="yellow">To find out if my family...</font>

75
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,900
<font color="yellow">is on par with yours?</font>

76
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,300
<font color="yellow">Who said I'd date you?</font>

77
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,300
<font color="yellow">You're not a catch at all.</font>

78
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,060
<font color="yellow">You need to buy me meat.</font>

79
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,780
<font color="yellow">That should taste lovely.</font>

80
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,740
<font color="yellow">I'll call you later. Bye.</font>

81
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,380
<font color="yellow">There's nothing much this way. Go that way.</font>

82
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,940
<font color="yellow">I'll show you around.</font>

83
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,540
<font color="yellow">Can you do that?</font>

84
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,660
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be a nuisance.</font>

85
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,060
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'm sure you did it out of excitement.</font>

86
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,340
<font color="yellow">You seem to know Quebec well.</font>

87
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,860
<font color="yellow">Were you here before?</font>

88
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,100
<font color="yellow">Yes. I was here with my first love.</font>

89
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,060
<font color="yellow">We came here four times.</font>

90
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,380
<font color="yellow">You have a girlfriend, then.</font>

91
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,620
<font color="yellow">Not anymore.</font>

92
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,380
<font color="yellow">Why did you break up?</font>

93
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,580
<font color="yellow">I was very far away for a very long time.</font>

94
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,260
<font color="yellow">It took a toll on her.</font>

95
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,740
<font color="yellow">She'd forgotten all about me.</font>

96
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,900
<font color="yellow">First loves never work out.</font>

97
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,300
<font color="yellow">You must've loved her a lot.</font>

98
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,740
<font color="yellow">I guess I did, considering I can't hold back.</font>

99
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,580
<font color="yellow">What are you holding back?</font>

100
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,860
<font color="yellow">I want to hold her hand...</font>

101
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,540
<font color="yellow">and hold her close.</font>

102
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,620
<font color="yellow">The woman forgot about you...</font>

103
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,220
<font color="yellow">but you didn't forget her.</font>

104
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,940
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

105
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,180
<font color="yellow">Never for a second or a day.</font>

106
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
<font color="yellow">What a lucky woman.</font>

107
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,740
<font color="yellow">Have you heard?</font>

108
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,780
<font color="yellow">If you catch a falling maple leaf,</font>

109
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,500
<font color="yellow">you fall in love with the person you're with.</font>

110
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,020
<font color="yellow">Is that what your first love said?</font>

111
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,820
<font color="yellow">Yes, and I caught a leaf.</font>

112
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,660
<font color="yellow">Do you still believe that? It didn't work out for you.</font>

113
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,540
<font color="yellow">You're here with me because it didn't work out.</font>

114
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,580
<font color="yellow">And you have a thing for me.</font>

115
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,580
<font color="yellow">Men can be really silly. They tell the woman they like...</font>

116
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,100
<font color="yellow">about their exes.</font>

117
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,580
<font color="yellow">- Is that so? - Isn't it?</font>

118
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,140
<font color="yellow">Are you an idiot? A teenager?</font>

119
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,260
<font color="yellow">Do you believe catching a leaf makes you fall in love?</font>

120
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,780
<font color="yellow">He fell for that woman's tricks.</font>

121
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,580
<font color="yellow">He's such an idiot.</font>

122
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,780
<font color="yellow">(You are his bride.)</font>

123
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,900
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

124
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,340
<font color="yellow">Are you living happily with the man who gave you that necklace?</font>

125
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,620
<font color="yellow">I don't remember anything.</font>

126
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,420
<font color="yellow">I don't even know which chunk of my memories I lost.</font>

127
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,900
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

128
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,740
<font color="yellow">I don't remember anything.</font>

129
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,220
<font color="yellow">Nothing at all.</font>

130
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,500
<font color="yellow">Let's just go and ask.</font>

131
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,100
<font color="yellow">That should be quicker.</font>

132
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,140
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

133
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,820
<font color="yellow">Are you staying here?</font>

134
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,580
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - I see.</font>

135
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,540
<font color="yellow">I have a question.</font>

136
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,380
<font color="yellow">Did we...</font>

137
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,900
<font color="yellow">meet somewhere before?</font>

138
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,580
<font color="yellow">About 10 years ago?</font>

139
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,620
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

140
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,100
<font color="yellow">It's a bit weird but I'm not hitting on you.</font>

141
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,100
<font color="yellow">I keep having this weird feeling.</font>

142
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,620
<font color="yellow">Do you like me?</font>

143
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,900
<font color="yellow">No. I said I'm not hitting on you.</font>

144
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,620
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

145
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,980
<font color="yellow">You're my type.</font>

146
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,540
<font color="yellow">For your information,</font>

147
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,180
<font color="yellow">I don't have a boyfriend.</font>

148
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,340
<font color="yellow">I'm not very lucky with men in this life.</font>

149
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,660
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

150
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,660
<font color="yellow">I'll get going then.</font>

151
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,500
<font color="yellow">Have a nice walk.</font>

152
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,740
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me. - Excuse me.</font>

153
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,340
<font color="yellow">You go first.</font>

154
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,580
<font color="yellow">You were right.</font>

155
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,140
<font color="yellow">A sandwich wasn't enough.</font>

156
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,900
<font color="yellow">Why don't we have early dinner? Aren't you hungry?</font>

157
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,420
<font color="yellow">It will be my treat.</font>

158
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,420
<font color="yellow">I was going to ask you out for dinner too.</font>

159
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,540
<font color="yellow">I know a restaurant that serves good beef.</font>

160
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,500
<font color="yellow">Beef.</font>

161
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,580
<font color="yellow">I was thoughtless.</font>

162
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,380
<font color="yellow">My feet hurt like crazy because I didn't bring my sneakers.</font>

163
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,420
<font color="yellow">Your feet might hurt, but you must look beautiful.</font>

164
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,780
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

165
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,420
<font color="yellow">At least you now know that you have to take sneakers with you next time.</font>

166
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,140
<font color="yellow">I know. It's not like I've been abroad before.</font>

167
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,420
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

168
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,700
<font color="yellow">Why would you go there now when you're just about to turn 30?</font>

169
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,260
<font color="yellow">When I was 29, I didn't even travel as far as to the corner store.</font>

170
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,300
<font color="yellow">Really? Thank you.</font>

171
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,580
<font color="yellow">I didn't have any appointments.</font>

172
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,060
<font color="yellow">I've been traveling around just fine...</font>

173
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,820
<font color="yellow">for someone who's never been abroad before.</font>

174
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,220
<font color="yellow">I rarely get lost and I never miss a meal.</font>

175
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,060
<font color="yellow">Now, I'm going to have a big chunk of beef.</font>

176
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,060
<font color="yellow">I'm at a nice restaurant with some man.</font>

177
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,700
<font color="yellow">It's the man that has to be nice, not the restaurant.</font>

178
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,540
<font color="yellow">I have to go. I'm sleepy.</font>

179
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,020
<font color="yellow">Okay. Have a good night.</font>

180
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
<font color="yellow">The future I saw was right.</font>

181
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,140
<font color="yellow">Over here, Sir.</font>

182
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,580
<font color="yellow">You ended up meeting this guy.</font>

183
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,900
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed that I can't stop smiling.</font>

184
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,740
<font color="yellow">Did you come here...</font>

185
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
<font color="yellow">with your first love too?</font>

186
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,500
<font color="yellow">You fed her a really expensive meal.</font>

187
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,060
<font color="yellow">It was useless though. She forgot all about it.</font>

188
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,740
<font color="yellow">Did you see her even after breaking up?</font>

189
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,220
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

190
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,300
<font color="yellow">I heard that the memory about first love often gets glamorized...</font>

191
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,900
<font color="yellow">and you get disappointed when you meet again.</font>

192
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,140
<font color="yellow">No, it's not true. She's still beautiful.</font>

193
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,340
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

194
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,980
<font color="yellow">I'm going to order. Are you ready to order?</font>

195
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,020
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

196
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,580
<font color="yellow">- I will... - What do you think about...</font>

197
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,980
<font color="yellow">a girl who just became quite beautiful?</font>

198
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,900
<font color="yellow">I recently became quite beautiful. Of course that's what I think.</font>

199
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,340
<font color="yellow">Can we meet again tomorrow?</font>

200
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,500
<font color="yellow">I'm flying out tomorrow afternoon.</font>

201
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,700
<font color="yellow">Before you go.</font>

202
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,220
<font color="yellow">And also in Korea.</font>

203
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,380
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

204
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,980
<font color="yellow">She won't be here today, either.</font>

205
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,660
<font color="yellow">Just give her this.</font>

206
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,060
<font color="yellow">No wonder I wanted to go to work all of a sudden.</font>

207
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,380
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

208
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,140
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

209
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,220
<font color="yellow">Are you the one who's been looking for me?</font>

210
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,740
<font color="yellow">Yes. You are Yu Deok Hwa, right?</font>

211
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,140
<font color="yellow">The previous owner of the building.</font>

212
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,980
<font color="yellow">Do you remember the chicken restaurant on the first floor?</font>

213
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
<font color="yellow">Nine years ago.</font>

214
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,540
<font color="yellow">I remember of course. You never paid rent on time.</font>

215
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,900
<font color="yellow">Why were you looking for me?</font>

216
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,060
<font color="yellow">You sent me a letter through this person, didn't you?</font>

217
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,580
<font color="yellow">Can I...</font>

218
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,580
<font color="yellow">get his contact number?</font>

219
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,980
<font color="yellow">Do you want his number, not mine?</font>

220
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,540
<font color="yellow">I'm a little busy, you see.</font>

221
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,820
<font color="yellow">(Sunny not Sun Hee)</font>

222
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,700
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

223
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,420
<font color="yellow">Where is a nice and remote place...</font>

224
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,900
<font color="yellow">for the people who just started dating?</font>

225
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,060
<font color="yellow">There's nothing much here. Let's go that way.</font>

226
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,900
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

227
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,860
<font color="yellow">you?</font>

228
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,060
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

229
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,220
<font color="yellow">a ghost?</font>

230
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,660
<font color="yellow">Did you die this time?</font>

231
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,420
<font color="yellow">Is that why I kept seeing you?</font>

232
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,980
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

233
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,620
<font color="yellow">still see ghosts?</font>

234
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,260
<font color="yellow">Still?</font>

235
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,860
<font color="yellow">How do you know that I can see ghosts?</font>

236
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,860
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

237
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,740
<font color="yellow">Are you really a ghost?</font>

238
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,740
<font color="yellow">How do you know that I used to see ghosts?</font>

239
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,860
<font color="yellow">Is your name...</font>

240
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,540
<font color="yellow">Kim Shin by any chance?</font>

241
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,580
<font color="yellow">You came here 10 years ago with me. Is that correct?</font>

242
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,740
<font color="yellow">Why don't I remember it at all?</font>

243
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,260
<font color="yellow">Please answer me.</font>

244
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,820
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

245
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,500
<font color="yellow">Why did I write not to forget you?</font>

246
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,500
<font color="yellow">Why did I write that I am your bride?</font>

247
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,140
<font color="yellow">You are Kim Shin, right?</font>

248
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,220
<font color="yellow">You are, aren't you?</font>

249
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,540
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

250
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,100
<font color="yellow">It's late. You should go back to the hotel.</font>

251
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,220
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you surprised?</font>

252
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,380
<font color="yellow">- What? - I sat here all of a sudden.</font>

253
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,100
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you surprised?</font>

254
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,780
<font color="yellow">Do you know who I am?</font>

255
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,500
<font color="yellow">You look like you do.</font>

256
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,220
<font color="yellow">No. It's my first time seeing you.</font>

257
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,060
<font color="yellow">I looked at you because you sat down.</font>

258
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,700
<font color="yellow">You came to my shop, didn't you?</font>

259
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,500
<font color="yellow">You brought Producer Ji's letter.</font>

260
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,060
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

261
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,860
<font color="yellow">You cried on the street.</font>

262
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,060
<font color="yellow">On a cold day, you were walking...</font>

263
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,140
<font color="yellow">in the street while crying, so I remembered you.</font>

264
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,900
<font color="yellow">Did you cry because of me?</font>

265
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,060
<font color="yellow">Many people get surprised, but not many people cry.</font>

266
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,780
<font color="yellow">You look...</font>

267
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,580
<font color="yellow">very similar to one woman I know.</font>

268
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,260
<font color="yellow">Not too many people look like me though.</font>

269
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,060
<font color="yellow">Anyway, let's introduce each other.</font>

270
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,220
<font color="yellow">What's your name?</font>

271
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,580
<font color="yellow">I'm Wang Yeo.</font>

272
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,940
<font color="yellow">It sounds like a king's name.</font>

273
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,500
<font color="yellow">My name is Sunny. S, U, N, N, Y.</font>

274
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,140
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see you.</font>

275
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,220
<font color="yellow">I saw you on surveillance camera.</font>

276
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,220
<font color="yellow">You were so handsome that...</font>

277
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,180
<font color="yellow">I was curious about how much more handsome you'd be in person.</font>

278
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,980
<font color="yellow">It turns out you look better on screen.</font>

279
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,220
<font color="yellow">Thank you for delivering the letter.</font>

280
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,780
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, Eun Tak got to travel abroad.</font>

281
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,220
<font color="yellow">Now that I saw you in person, I will get going now.</font>

282
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,900
<font color="yellow">I have to run the shop.</font>

283
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,580
<font color="yellow">It's cold, so don't cry while walking.</font>

284
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,420
<font color="yellow">Your face will freeze.</font>

285
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,540
<font color="yellow">It was...</font>

286
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,100
<font color="yellow">nice seeing you.</font>

287
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,740
<font color="yellow">Same here.</font>

288
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:44,100
<font color="yellow">BioskopKeren.ORG</font>

289
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,540
<font color="yellow">It was nice seeing you, too.</font>

290
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,220
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim Woo Bin.</font>

291
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,540
<font color="yellow">It was...</font>

292
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,100
<font color="yellow">nice seeing you.</font>

293
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,020
<font color="yellow">It was nice seeing you, too.</font>

294
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,740
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim Woo Bin.</font>

295
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,980
<font color="yellow">Remember.</font>

296
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,860
<font color="yellow">You must remember.</font>

297
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,900
<font color="yellow">His name is Kim Shin.</font>

298
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,140
<font color="yellow">Why is it raining so much?</font>

299
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,420
<font color="yellow">Why isn't the part-timer coming?</font>

300
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,020
<font color="yellow">The number you have dialed is not available.</font>

301
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,380
<font color="yellow">Please leave a message after the tone.</font>

302
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,300
<font color="yellow">What is going on?</font>

303
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,620
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you startled me.</font>

304
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,940
<font color="yellow">Kid, what are you doing there?</font>

305
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,420
<font color="yellow">My grandma didn't come home yet.</font>

306
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,540
<font color="yellow">At least you should be home, then.</font>

307
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,380
<font color="yellow">You're Eun Tak's friend, aren't you? Come inside for now.</font>

308
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,700
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak isn't here today. She skipped work.</font>

309
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,220
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

310
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,940
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

311
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,260
<font color="yellow">There you go. It's hot so blow on it before you drink.</font>

312
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,940
<font color="yellow">When is your grandma coming?</font>

313
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,420
<font color="yellow">Later at night when she's made money.</font>

314
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,780
<font color="yellow">You're pretty unfortunate yourself, aren't you?</font>

315
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,580
<font color="yellow">Grandma said there are many people who are more unfortunate than me.</font>

316
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,020
<font color="yellow">Good boy.</font>

317
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,140
<font color="yellow">It's all the deity's fault.</font>

318
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,660
<font color="yellow">He should distribute more evenly. Only the unfortunate gets the worst.</font>

319
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,500
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so? He's such a jerk.</font>

320
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,020
<font color="yellow">You'll get punished if you say things like that.</font>

321
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,620
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

322
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,420
<font color="yellow">I've been through a lot starting with the goblin couple...</font>

323
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,620
<font color="yellow">and the Grim Reaper. I can speak ill of him.</font>

324
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,660
<font color="yellow">He made me remember my past life and then tried to erase it again.</font>

325
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,060
<font color="yellow">I wonder just how many people suffered because of him.</font>

326
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,420
<font color="yellow">Don't you think oblivion is the deity's way of showing grace?</font>

327
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,220
<font color="yellow">It's so you won't fall in agony.</font>

328
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,660
<font color="yellow">Who does he think he is? What gives him the right?</font>

329
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,620
<font color="yellow">Do you see that?</font>

330
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,780
<font color="yellow">At my restaurant, even the deity has to fetch his own water.</font>

331
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,380
<font color="yellow">Just like how I decide my own life.</font>

332
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,340
<font color="yellow">It's my life and my memory.</font>

333
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,820
<font color="yellow">He didn't even ask for my opinion. I didn't ask for it.</font>

334
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,020
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of my own life.</font>

335
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,780
<font color="yellow">I really wish he stays out of it.</font>

336
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,980
<font color="yellow">Okay. I understand.</font>

337
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,140
<font color="yellow">Who are you to say that?</font>

338
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,420
<font color="yellow">(5 years ago)</font>

339
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,980
<font color="yellow">- All right. A bit more to go. - Thank you.</font>

340
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,740
<font color="yellow">- Watch your step. - Thank you.</font>

341
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,300
<font color="yellow">Are you moving?</font>

342
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,180
<font color="yellow">Yes. I've been saving up.</font>

343
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,060
<font color="yellow">I'll still go to your restaurant to have chicken.</font>

344
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,820
<font color="yellow">You should come. I'll give you a discount.</font>

345
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,860
<font color="yellow">It's hard labour what you do.</font>

346
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,300
<font color="yellow">- I'll move this one. - Okay.</font>

347
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,940
<font color="yellow">Hello, I just moved in today. I live on the rooftop.</font>

348
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,820
<font color="yellow">It's nice to meet you.</font>

349
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,220
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

350
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,740
<font color="yellow">Today is our first day.</font>

351
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,700
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

352
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,100
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

353
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,820
<font color="yellow">Just a minute.</font>

354
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,780
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Sorry about that.</font>

355
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,220
<font color="yellow">Brother?</font>

356
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,940
<font color="yellow">To the one who thought...</font>

357
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,420
<font color="yellow">that oblivion would bring me peace of mind.</font>

358
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,340
<font color="yellow">The moment our eyes met, I knew...</font>

359
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,580
<font color="yellow">that you too retained your memories.</font>

360
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,020
<font color="yellow">Hence, in this life, we'll have to...</font>

361
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,900
<font color="yellow">I hope...</font>

362
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,100
<font color="yellow">at least you get this happy ending.</font>

363
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,820
<font color="yellow">Live in each of our happy endings...</font>

364
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,420
<font color="yellow">and ignore this tragedy.</font>

365
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,140
<font color="yellow">I pray that in our next life...</font>

366
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,300
<font color="yellow">The meeting with you is short and the wait is long.</font>

367
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,940
<font color="yellow">The wait will be short and the meeting shall be long.</font>

368
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,900
<font color="yellow">I don't have a religion.</font>

369
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,420
<font color="yellow">You called 10 times just to tell me that?</font>

370
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,660
<font color="yellow">That we won't need an excuse to see each other.</font>

371
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,900
<font color="yellow">Entitled with our own dearest names.</font>

372
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,380
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

373
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,100
<font color="yellow">Is this a coincidence?</font>

374
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,980
<font color="yellow">So we could greet each other when we accidentally run into each other.</font>

375
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,060
<font color="yellow">Every clumsy thing...</font>

376
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,780
<font color="yellow">that I do is incorrect.</font>

377
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,500
<font color="yellow">With our love always being the solution.</font>

378
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,860
<font color="yellow">I pray that we can meet like that.</font>

379
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,220
<font color="yellow">It was nice seeing you.</font>

380
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,260
<font color="yellow">I'm just happy that I saw your face.</font>

381
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,300
<font color="yellow">Same here.</font>

382
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,060
<font color="yellow">Kim Woo Bin.</font>

383
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,420
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, you're Kim Woo Bin.</font>

384
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,140
<font color="yellow">Wang Yeo.</font>

385
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,380
<font color="yellow">And sometimes, you're Wang Yeo.</font>

386
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,940
<font color="yellow">Please live a long and happy life.</font>

387
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,620
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

388
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,140
<font color="yellow">Why did that chicken restaurant owner ask for his number?</font>

389
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,740
<font color="yellow">Who is Ji Eun Tak that was written on that letter?</font>

390
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,180
<font color="yellow">Why do I feel like I'm the only one that doesn't know?</font>

391
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,540
<font color="yellow">Of course, a rich heir...</font>

392
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,380
<font color="yellow">should experience amnesia at least once in his life.</font>

393
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,420
<font color="yellow">Although...</font>

394
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,180
<font color="yellow">I feel like I could be someone important to them.</font>

395
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,380
<font color="yellow">I didn't think it through.</font>

396
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,980
<font color="yellow">If she forgot about me,</font>

397
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,740
<font color="yellow">then I'm probably worth being forgotten.</font>

398
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,820
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

399
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,060
<font color="yellow">miss her a lot.</font>

400
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,140
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

401
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,420
<font color="yellow">If you catch a leaf falling,</font>

402
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,860
<font color="yellow">- your love will come true. - Your love will come true.</font>

403
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,100
<font color="yellow">No matter how I think about it, I think you're a goblin.</font>

404
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,220
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

405
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,900
<font color="yellow">There is no sadness that lasts for eternity.</font>

406
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,300
<font color="yellow">There is no love that lasts for eternity either.</font>

407
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,580
<font color="yellow">I'm going to vote that there is.</font>

408
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,220
<font color="yellow">Which one are you voting for?</font>

409
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,820
<font color="yellow">Love or sadness?</font>

410
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,140
<font color="yellow">Sad love.</font>

411
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,940
<font color="yellow">I missed you.</font>

412
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,380
<font color="yellow">I won't leave you behind.</font>

413
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,340
<font color="yellow">Why not? Because I'm the goblin's bride?</font>

414
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,140
<font color="yellow">I miss you.</font>

415
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,700
<font color="yellow">I miss you.</font>

416
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,820
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

417
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,660
<font color="yellow">I miss you.</font>

418
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,260
<font color="yellow">It's really amazing now that I think about it.</font>

419
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,780
<font color="yellow">You said you'd come back as rain...</font>

420
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,580
<font color="yellow">and as snow.</font>

421
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,860
<font color="yellow">You kept your promise.</font>

422
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,380
<font color="yellow">You came on the day of the first snowfall.</font>

423
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,660
<font color="yellow">"On the day of the first snowfall every year,"</font>

424
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,660
<font color="yellow">"the goblin agrees to be summoned by me."</font>

425
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,940
<font color="yellow">"I will be waiting for you."</font>

426
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,980
<font color="yellow">Was it really because of the agreement?</font>

427
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,620
<font color="yellow">I begged you not to go.</font>

428
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,180
<font color="yellow">How could you leave me?</font>

429
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,380
<font color="yellow">Even if that was for the best,</font>

430
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,620
<font color="yellow">you took my hands to...</font>

431
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,820
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

432
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,820
<font color="yellow">It's okay, you kept your promise.</font>

433
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,260
<font color="yellow">What was the meaning of returning to nothingness?</font>

434
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,180
<font color="yellow">That I wouldn't be able to see you.</font>

435
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,420
<font color="yellow">I didn't know why,</font>

436
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,940
<font color="yellow">but I turned insane whenever it rained.</font>

437
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,980
<font color="yellow">It hurt and I cried.</font>

438
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,180
<font color="yellow">I even mumbled to myself.</font>

439
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,100
<font color="yellow">No pills could help me.</font>

440
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,300
<font color="yellow">I should have lived well...</font>

441
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,660
<font color="yellow">in return for all the love you gave to me.</font>

442
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,220
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

443
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,620
<font color="yellow">I'll make you happy from now on.</font>

444
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,060
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because I think you haven't noticed,</font>

445
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,700
<font color="yellow">but you've been touching me for a while.</font>

446
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,900
<font color="yellow">You're making me feel embarrassed.</font>

447
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,260
<font color="yellow">I'm checking...</font>

448
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,780
<font color="yellow">because I still can't believe it.</font>

449
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,820
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if this is a dream.</font>

450
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,100
<font color="yellow">It's not a dream.</font>

451
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,380
<font color="yellow">I had too many...</font>

452
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,980
<font color="yellow">dreams like this.</font>

453
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,540
<font color="yellow">It's not a dream.</font>

454
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,420
<font color="yellow">I still can't believe it.</font>

455
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,980
<font color="yellow">I'm too surprised.</font>

456
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,300
<font color="yellow">My heart is still racing.</font>

457
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,660
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to surprise you even more?</font>

458
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,140
<font color="yellow">I can buy you the whole row...</font>

459
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,580
<font color="yellow">in one transaction.</font>

460
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,420
<font color="yellow">Then I want a drink.</font>

461
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,420
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

462
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,620
<font color="yellow">That sounds good.</font>

463
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,420
<font color="yellow">By the way, I don't think...</font>

464
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,820
<font color="yellow">I should call you Mister any more.</font>

465
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,820
<font color="yellow">"Honey" is a bit too much.</font>

466
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,740
<font color="yellow">In 10 years, we'll be the same age.</font>

467
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,420
<font color="yellow">Why don't we just call each other by names starting now?</font>

468
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,780
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

469
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,140
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

470
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,220
<font color="yellow">What about my boss? Did you see her?</font>

471
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,660
<font color="yellow">Just from afar. She didn't see me.</font>

472
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,540
<font color="yellow">She earned a lot of money,</font>

473
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,620
<font color="yellow">so she's a landlord now.</font>

474
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,980
<font color="yellow">Could it be thanks to her brother who brings wealth?</font>

475
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,380
<font color="yellow">Anyway, she's well.</font>

476
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:23,340
<font color="yellow">What about the Grim Reaper? Did you see him?</font>

477
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,340
<font color="yellow">He's still living at my house.</font>

478
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,420
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if he's well.</font>

479
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,660
<font color="yellow">We really found friendship in each other now.</font>

480
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,340
<font color="yellow">Actually, it's been a while.</font>

481
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,660
<font color="yellow">What fates the two have.</font>

482
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:08,860
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

483
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,020
<font color="yellow">I missed you, too.</font>

484
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,820
<font color="yellow">A lot.</font>

485
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,300
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

486
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,540
<font color="yellow">A lot.</font>

487
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,140
<font color="yellow">You're leaving again.</font>

488
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,260
<font color="yellow">I want to stay with you longer too,</font>

489
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,060
<font color="yellow">but I only took a few days off from work.</font>

490
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,420
<font color="yellow">Since I'm a human,</font>

491
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,300
<font color="yellow">I have to take a taxi to the airport...</font>

492
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,060
<font color="yellow">and leave a record with immigration.</font>

493
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,940
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I'll be arrested.</font>

494
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,140
<font color="yellow">- I'll visit you at jail. - Come on.</font>

495
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,060
<font color="yellow">Or do you want to take the plane with me?</font>

496
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,140
<font color="yellow">I've never thought about that.</font>

497
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,420
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to take it with me?</font>

498
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,020
<font color="yellow">I do, but I don't have a passport.</font>

499
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,140
<font color="yellow">I came in a rush, so I didn't get a chance to.</font>

500
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,660
<font color="yellow">Then I'll see you in Korea in about 17 hours.</font>

501
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,300
<font color="yellow">It's going to take so long.</font>

502
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,700
<font color="yellow">You'll be late, let's go.</font>

503
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,300
<font color="yellow">Just one more minute.</font>

504
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,660
<font color="yellow">Just one more time.</font>

505
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,620
<font color="yellow">Did you wait long?</font>

506
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,380
<font color="yellow">For 17 hours. I thought I was going to die.</font>

507
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,860
<font color="yellow">When the gate opened and I saw you walk out...</font>

508
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,420
<font color="yellow">You saw an angel, right?</font>

509
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,180
<font color="yellow">You're not an angel.</font>

510
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,420
<font color="yellow">Let go of my hand. Let go.</font>

511
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,660
<font color="yellow">Never.</font>

512
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,740
<font color="yellow">Did you forget your boyfriend is a goblin?</font>

513
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,700
<font color="yellow">This is cheating.</font>

514
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,500
<font color="yellow">I'm so excited.</font>

515
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,300
<font color="yellow">I forget there are cool things behind your doors.</font>

516
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,380
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

517
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,700
<font color="yellow">Ms. Ji.</font>

518
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,220
<font color="yellow">Where's Ms. Kim?</font>

519
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,860
<font color="yellow">You should've called.</font>

520
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,860
<font color="yellow">She didn't come in today.</font>

521
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,940
<font color="yellow">I guess she made enough money.</font>

522
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,860
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thanks.</font>

523
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,660
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

524
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,860
<font color="yellow">Is she busy?</font>

525
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,100
<font color="yellow">I'm a little nervous.</font>

526
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,100
<font color="yellow">I'm old enough to know better.</font>

527
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,660
<font color="yellow">It's a long trip.</font>

528
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,220
<font color="yellow">He'll be here soon.</font>

529
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,940
<font color="yellow">This feels...</font>

530
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,420
<font color="yellow">longer...</font>

531
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:47,100
<font color="yellow">than 70 years.</font>

532
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,060
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

533
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,540
<font color="yellow">I'm very late.</font>

534
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,660
<font color="yellow">How many years has it been since we saw each other?</font>

535
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,620
<font color="yellow">It's been 73 years.</font>

536
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,540
<font color="yellow">It was my first birthday after we got married.</font>

537
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,260
<font color="yellow">You said you'd be back after training.</font>

538
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,220
<font color="yellow">You said you'd be right back.</font>

539
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,260
<font color="yellow">But they created the DMZ.</font>

540
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,140
<font color="yellow">I thought...</font>

541
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,700
<font color="yellow">they would remove it soon.</font>

542
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,540
<font color="yellow">It took long to finally give you this.</font>

543
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,860
<font color="yellow">I'm too old...</font>

544
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,860
<font color="yellow">to even put it on.</font>

545
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:40,940
<font color="yellow">You are still...</font>

546
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:43,620
<font color="yellow">just as pretty.</font>

547
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,340
<font color="yellow">I've aged, waiting for you. How am I pretty?</font>

548
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,660
<font color="yellow">If you were going to make me wait this long,</font>

549
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,980
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't have said you'd be back soon.</font>

550
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,900
<font color="yellow">Why don't you sit and talk?</font>

551
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,860
<font color="yellow">The tea's gone cold, so I'll have to reheat it.</font>

552
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,420
<font color="yellow">It's chilly out.</font>

553
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,140
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

554
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,940
<font color="yellow">I'm so glad I can see you like this before I go.</font>

555
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,580
<font color="yellow">I have no regrets now.</font>

556
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,060
<font color="yellow">So where are you buried?</font>

557
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:25,620
<font color="yellow">Were you buried somewhere warm?</font>

558
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,140
<font color="yellow">I was buried in the North,</font>

559
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:33,220
<font color="yellow">so azaleas will bloom on that mountain in the spring.</font>

560
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,860
<font color="yellow">You're late.</font>

561
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,660
<font color="yellow">Yes. I had an unexpected deceased soul.</font>

562
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,740
<font color="yellow">You have an unexpected guest, too.</font>

563
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,580
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mr. Grim Reaper.</font>

564
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,300
<font color="yellow">May I just call you "Grim Reaper" now?</font>

565
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,420
<font color="yellow">Missing Soul.</font>

566
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,900
<font color="yellow">She really is an unexpected guest.</font>

567
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,740
<font color="yellow">She remembered everything.</font>

568
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,220
<font color="yellow">She recognized me.</font>

569
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,260
<font color="yellow">"Missing Soul".</font>

570
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,700
<font color="yellow">I haven't heard that in so long.</font>

571
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,340
<font color="yellow">I heard everything.</font>

572
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,220
<font color="yellow">How could you not come once when you remembered everything?</font>

573
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,300
<font color="yellow">What good could seeing a grim reaper bring to a human?</font>

574
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,420
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

575
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,820
<font color="yellow">I've been enjoying your radio show.</font>

576
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,060
<font color="yellow">It's been way too long to say it's been a while.</font>

577
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,700
<font color="yellow">I'm already 29 years old.</font>

578
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:31,820
<font color="yellow">29.</font>

579
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,860
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

580
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,260
<font color="yellow">Let's eat. Wash your hands.</font>

581
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,380
<font color="yellow">Shall I tell you a secret?</font>

582
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,540
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

583
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:03,340
<font color="yellow">You will meet a grim reaper when you are 29.</font>

584
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,300
<font color="yellow">Even if it's not me.</font>

585
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,540
<font color="yellow">That's the fate of a missing soul.</font>

586
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,820
<font color="yellow">This world requires order...</font>

587
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,620
<font color="yellow">and nine...</font>

588
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,140
<font color="yellow">is the closest lower number to 10,</font>

589
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:19,380
<font color="yellow">a perfect number that symbolizes the almighty.</font>

590
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,940
<font color="yellow">I wish you luck then...</font>

591
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,500
<font color="yellow">as well.</font>

592
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,660
<font color="yellow">You met me...</font>

593
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,140
<font color="yellow">at the age of 29 as well.</font>

594
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,820
<font color="yellow">You met a grim reaper.</font>

595
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,660
<font color="yellow">Eun Tak, it hasn't been a month yet.</font>

596
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,900
<font color="yellow">Are the symptoms...</font>

597
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:48,100
<font color="yellow">No. I came to say bye...</font>

598
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,700
<font color="yellow">and to thank you for everything.</font>

599
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,700
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

600
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,660
<font color="yellow">for keeping me alive.</font>

601
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,180
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I would've been very miserable.</font>

602
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:03,140
<font color="yellow">I finally remembered how to be happy.</font>

603
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,660
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

604
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,500
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

605
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,540
<font color="yellow">what is that method?</font>

606
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,980
<font color="yellow">I smell meat.</font>

607
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,940
<font color="yellow">Your taste hasn't changed.</font>

608
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,700
<font color="yellow">I have the pan on the stove.</font>

609
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,020
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Oh, did you eat yet?</font>

610
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,700
<font color="yellow">If not, eat with me.</font>

611
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,300
<font color="yellow">You're holding the same book you were holding nine years ago.</font>

612
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,300
<font color="yellow">When will you finish reading that?</font>

613
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,580
<font color="yellow">A man reads and writes the same book 100 times.</font>

614
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,620
<font color="yellow">Look at you lie.</font>

615
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,060
<font color="yellow">How cute.</font>

616
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,540
<font color="yellow">- Is it obvious? - Yes.</font>

617
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,620
<font color="yellow">What is this? Where am I?</font>

618
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,300
<font color="yellow">Under the blanket.</font>

619
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,300
<font color="yellow">You're really vulgar.</font>

00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,660
<font color="yellow">Leave if you don't feel like it.</font>

621
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,140
<font color="yellow">It's so warm.</font>

622
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,060
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

623
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:38,180
<font color="yellow">Now that I'm warm I feel sleepy.</font>

624
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:54,180
<font color="yellow">One, two, three...</font>

625
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,300
<font color="yellow">Four, five...</font>

626
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,740
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

627
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,500
<font color="yellow">I was so scared.</font>

628
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,300
<font color="yellow">Scared that it's a dream.</font>

629
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,740
<font color="yellow">That I'm still dreaming.</font>

630
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,420
<font color="yellow">It's not a dream.</font>

631
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,900
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

632
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:24,380
<font color="yellow">From now on, show up before I count to three.</font>

633
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,700
<font color="yellow">Don't go anywhere, okay?</font>

634
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,300
<font color="yellow">Okay, I won't go anywhere.</font>

635
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,020
<font color="yellow">Get in bed.</font>

636
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,660
<font color="yellow">You left me once.</font>

637
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,780
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

638
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,940
<font color="yellow">You, over there.</font>

639
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:32,140
<font color="yellow">Why did you leave Eun Tak's room to stare into mine?</font>

640
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,620
<font color="yellow">Are you Mr. Restaurant?</font>

641
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,580
<font color="yellow">Mr. Restaurant?</font>

642
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,540
<font color="yellow">So that's what happens.</font>

643
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,420
<font color="yellow">You choose that path in the end.</font>

644
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,980
<font color="yellow">It is good to see you smile.</font>

645
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,900
<font color="yellow">Who's smiling? Should I smile right now?</font>

646
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,660
<font color="yellow">Your temperament has not changed at all.</font>

647
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:14,180
<font color="yellow">Maybe not now, but you smile in the end, so all is well.</font>

648
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,500
<font color="yellow">Where are you going dressed like that?</font>

649
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,700
<font color="yellow">Are you actually leaving? Hey.</font>

650
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,700
<font color="yellow">Make my part-timer...</font>

651
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:39,980
<font color="yellow">a happy woman.</font>

652
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,980
<font color="yellow">Your foolish little sister...</font>

653
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,500
<font color="yellow">will be happy as well.</font>

654
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,020
<font color="yellow">Where did he go so early in the morning? Scalpel.</font>

655
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,020
<font color="yellow">Uncle Tenant.</font>

656
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,140
<font color="yellow">What's that watch? I want it.</font>

657
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,740
<font color="yellow">Time is everything in my line of work.</font>

658
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:10,540
<font color="yellow">A grim reaper prefers black.</font>

659
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,420
<font color="yellow">I like it. This is your breakfast. Do you like it?</font>

660
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,820
<font color="yellow">There you go again.</font>

661
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,700
<font color="yellow">You're still so careless.</font>

662
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,180
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what you're saying?</font>

663
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,580
<font color="yellow">He just found you out.</font>

664
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,500
<font color="yellow">I found out about you first.</font>

665
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,860
<font color="yellow">You had blue flames all over you when you came over.</font>

666
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,740
<font color="yellow">I thought it was spontaneous combustion.</font>

667
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:33,340
<font color="yellow">You careless goblin.</font>

668
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:38,300
<font color="yellow">Deok Hwa, it'll be hard to believe, but you should know the truth.</font>

669
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,420
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

670
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,740
<font color="yellow">That he's a goblin and you're a grim reaper?</font>

671
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,300
<font color="yellow">- How do you know that? - We just told him.</font>

672
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,300
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

673
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,100
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why you aren't shocked.</font>

674
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,820
<font color="yellow">Grandpa told me ever since I turned six.</font>

675
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,980
<font color="yellow">That I have an uncle who's a goblin.</font>

676
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,940
<font color="yellow">That our family served that goblin for generations.</font>

677
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,580
<font color="yellow">I thought it was some kind of odd religion.</font>

678
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:05,060
<font color="yellow">I never imagined he meant a literal goblin.</font>

679
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:08,180
<font color="yellow">I understand. It would be hard to imagine.</font>

680
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,700
<font color="yellow">Prove it.</font>

681
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:14,380
<font color="yellow">Prove it if you can. Both of you, if you please.</font>

682
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,060
<font color="yellow">How was that?</font>

683
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:27,300
<font color="yellow">Ever seen psychokinesis at work? What do you think?</font>

684
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,500
<font color="yellow">Even humans can do that.</font>

685
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,220
<font color="yellow">Don't you know David Copperfield?</font>

686
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,700
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

687
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:37,420
<font color="yellow">- That's all you have. - You need to come with me.</font>

688
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,820
<font color="yellow">You'll find out we aren't going anywhere nice.</font>

689

<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

690

<font color="yellow">If that is your fate, so be it.</font>

691
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,140
<font color="yellow">He was such a good boy.</font>

692
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,180
<font color="yellow">I will get revenge.</font>

693
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,700
<font color="yellow">It must be done before we become close.</font>

695
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:10,100
<font color="yellow">Uncles, you got it all wrong.</font>

696
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,980
<font color="yellow">I wanted to ask if I can set up a branch here in Seoul.</font>

697
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,700
<font color="yellow">Uncles.</font>

698
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,500
<font color="yellow">Uncles?</font>

01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,820
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

700
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,780
<font color="yellow">Aunt?</font>

701
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:37,180
<font color="yellow">Why do you look so surprised? I'm not banned from visiting.</font>

702
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,820
<font color="yellow">Do you have any food?</font>

703
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,860
<font color="yellow">No? I knew it.</font>

704
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,860
<font color="yellow">I bet you order in all the time because you're rich now.</font>

705
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,980
<font color="yellow">Come inside. I'll cook you something.</font>

706
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:58,700
<font color="yellow">I'm not a picky eater. I wouldn't mind something grilled.</font>

707
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:04,260
<font color="yellow">How are Gyeong Mi and Gyeong Sik?</font>

708
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:07,340
<font color="yellow">- Have you seen them? - I don't care about them.</font>

709

<font color="yellow">No news is good news.</font>

710
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,300
<font color="yellow">Good riddance, I say. I'm better off without them.</font>

711
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,780
<font color="yellow">Is this where you live? You make money, don't you?</font>

712
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:18,700
<font color="yellow">I guess good grades get you nowhere.</font>

713
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:20,380
<font color="yellow">Is it a monthly rent?</font>

714
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,820
<font color="yellow">Get me something to eat. I'm sure you're busy.</font>

715
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:32,500
<font color="yellow">Next week, we'll look into a few cases everyone can relate to.</font>

<font color="yellow">I hope you have a weekend ruled by common sense.</font>

719
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,700
<font color="yellow">I'll play you a song and after the commercial break,</font>

720
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,780
<font color="yellow">we'll come back with part three.</font>

721
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,700
<font color="yellow">How was that?</font>

722
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,500
<font color="yellow">You should switch jobs. You were awesome.</font>

723
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,180
<font color="yellow">You didn't even listen.</font>

724
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:05,980
<font color="yellow">You look upset. Shall we have a drink?</font>

725
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,500
<font color="yellow">No. I have to go and see the chicken lady...</font>

726
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,700
<font color="yellow">and I have plans. Maybe next time.</font>

727
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,980
<font color="yellow">See you around.</font>

728
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:17,940
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

729
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,100
<font color="yellow">I'll be packed and gone by the weekend.</font>

730
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:33,380
<font color="yellow">Very well. I'll inform your landlord.</font>

731
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:37,260
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

732
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:47,380
<font color="yellow">What got into you? One trip abroad...</font>

733
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,220
<font color="yellow">and you're acting like a foreigner?</font>

734
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,380
<font color="yellow">I missed you, Boss.</font>

735

<font color="yellow">You're never at work or at home.</font>

736
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,900
<font color="yellow">Where were you?</font>

737
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,580
<font color="yellow">Packing up to move.</font>

738
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:04,500
<font color="yellow">You're moving? Your home or business?</font>

739
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,140
<font color="yellow">Both.</font>

740
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,820
<font color="yellow">To overcome my new house phobia.</font>

741
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,820
<font color="yellow">There's no such thing.</font>

742
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:18,540
<font color="yellow">I got this for you from Canada.</font>

743
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,540
<font color="yellow">I've been carrying it around hoping to meet you.</font>

744
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,820
<font color="yellow">Did you find what you went to look for?</font>

745
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,620
<font color="yellow">Everything. I found everything.</font>

746
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,900
<font color="yellow">You won't believe me even if I told you.</font>

747
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:37,420
<font color="yellow">I found everything and a boyfriend.</font>

748
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:40,220
<font color="yellow">In Quebec of all places. It was destiny.</font>

749
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:42,420
<font color="yellow">Is your destiny handsome?</font>

750
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:43,900
<font color="yellow">Incredibly.</font>

751
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:47,060
<font color="yellow">He has large, clear eyes and he served his country.</font>

752
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:49,220
<font color="yellow">He must be so stubborn.</font>

753
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,860
<font color="yellow">He is.</font>

754
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,420
<font color="yellow">- What? - I know you have low standards.</font>

755
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,860
<font color="yellow">Did you have fun with Mr. Restaurant?</font>

756
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:04,380
<font color="yellow">I'll introduce him to you one day.</font>

757
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:07,420
<font color="yellow">I really want you to meet him.</font>

758
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,580
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

759
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:14,340
<font color="yellow">- Why? - I saw him leave your room.</font>

760
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,060
<font color="yellow">Do what you want.</font>

761
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,340
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

762
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,940
<font color="yellow">Just. I was thinking of old times.</font>

763
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:29,100
<font color="yellow">Okay. You do as you want with that, too.</font>

764
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:32,260
<font color="yellow">Take care of yourself, okay?</font>

765
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:33,500
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

766
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,140
<font color="yellow">You sound like we'll never see each other again.</font>

767
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,980
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then. I have to meet someone.</font>

768
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:39,980
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

769
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:54,580
<font color="yellow">Oh, you again.</font>

770
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,780
<font color="yellow">I'll say.</font>

771
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,500
<font color="yellow">He's a Canadian ghost.</font>

772
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:04,140
<font color="yellow">That man...</font>

773
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,340
<font color="yellow">was a ghost.</font>

774
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,700
<font color="yellow">I didn't see them for a while.</font>

775
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:13,980
<font color="yellow">Why have I started seeing them again?</font>

776
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,780
<font color="yellow">Why are you so deep in thought?</font>

777
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,420
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

778
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:24,740
<font color="yellow">I was thinking about Canada.</font>

779
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,300
<font color="yellow">Not about me?</font>

780
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,140
<font color="yellow">I was thinking about Canada,</font>

781
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:30,580
<font color="yellow">and naturally, I started thinking about you.</font>

782
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,860
<font color="yellow">You said you went there four times with your first love,</font>

783
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:35,340
<font color="yellow">that you fed your first love beef,</font>

784
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:38,060
<font color="yellow">and that your first love is still just as pretty.</font>

785
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:39,980
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

786
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:42,500
<font color="yellow">So I was thinking...</font>

787
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,820
<font color="yellow">maybe I am that first love.</font>

788
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,540
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

789
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,940
<font color="yellow">And something is off.</font>

790
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,660
<font color="yellow">Then who was that first love that you said you met...</font>

791
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,500
<font color="yellow">during late Joseon?</font>

792
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,300
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

793
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,620
<font color="yellow">Liar.</font>

794
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:00,500
<font color="yellow">Before we even met...</font>

795
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,300
<font color="yellow">Before I even knew,</font>

796
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,940
<font color="yellow">you had come by.</font>

797
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,500
<font color="yellow">I saw you on the 12th year of King Chuljong's reign.</font>

798
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,500
<font color="yellow">You in the far future.</font>

799
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:18,500
<font color="yellow">- Liar. - It almost seems like a lie.</font>

800
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,540
<font color="yellow">That's so cool. I'm so excited.</font>

801
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,780
<font color="yellow">It really seems like a lie...</font>

802
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:28,060
<font color="yellow">that the first love was me.</font>

803
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,820
<font color="yellow">That's right. Then back then...</font>

804
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:33,180
<font color="yellow">when I made a wish during the first snowfall,</font>

805
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,940
<font color="yellow">was that...</font>

806
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,980
<font color="yellow">how the warrior Kim Shin looked?</font>

807
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:39,860
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

808
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:41,860
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

809
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,260
<font color="yellow">I was really curious...</font>

810
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:47,780
<font color="yellow">about your past that I didn't know.</font>

811
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,780
<font color="yellow">But I got to see you.</font>

812
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:52,340
<font color="yellow">- Did I look strange? - No. You looked cool.</font>

813
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,780
<font color="yellow">A man from Goryeo.</font>

814
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,380
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's why I'm saying this.</font>

815
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,020
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because today is just about right.</font>

816
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:15,340
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because you are still shining.</font>

817
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,860
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because...</font>

818
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:22,300
<font color="yellow">you were that first love.</font>

819
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,700
<font color="yellow">On another day that is just about right,</font>

820
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,100
<font color="yellow">will you be my bride?</font>

821
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:21,980
<font color="yellow">(Goblin)</font>

822
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:25,660
<font color="yellow">For a long, long time...</font>

823
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:29,180
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

824
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:30,860
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

825
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:37,740
<font color="yellow">Is this our happy ending?</font>

826
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:39,980
<font color="yellow">That is...</font>

827
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,660
<font color="yellow">the instincts of that moment...</font>

828
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:44,740
<font color="yellow">and completely...</font>

829
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:47,500
<font color="yellow">one human being's choice.</font>

830
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,500
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

831
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:56,700
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>
