<i>[Episode 23]</i>

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,880
Baek Dae Gil.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,960
It's been a long time, Yi In Jwa.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,850
Was this your doing?

6
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,440
You should give up now.

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,660
<i>You have lost your horses
and provisions in the fire.</i>

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,750
<i>Half your troops are down
due to stomach illness.</i>

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,450
Advancing is not possible, Yi In Jwa.

10
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,010
No, it's too early to give up.

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,640
This is His Highness, Mil Poong Goon.

12
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,220
So, it is you, Baek Dae Gil.

13
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,280
The government will use the
entire military to stop this rebellion.

14
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,670
I hear that the king is gathering
50,000 troops.

15
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,250
All five branches of the military
will join and occupy Anseong.

16
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,760
Isn't that true?

17
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,580
You must have been very scared.

18
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,660
You even got yourself
a spy in the palace.

19
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,190
The cause of the great plan
is still alive and well.

20
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,750
We have over 10,000 men left here.

21
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:49,280
We also have over 100,000 men in
Gyeongsang-do and Jeolla-do.

22
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,530
So, go ahead and try to stop me.

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,460
I'll look forward to seeing you try.

24
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,620
Give up on this now.

25
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,760
Are you planning on
killing everyone here?

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,770
Everyone here volunteered to be here
and are my fellow comrades in this fight.

27
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,090
Who do you think you are?

28
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,850
Soon... everyone will find out.

29
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,460
They will know what you're truly like.

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,970
You will do whatever it takes
to get the throne.

31
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,550
You're willing to sacrifice
innocent people for your own ambition.

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,170
I will stop you.

33
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,740
I will send all of you back into
the arms of your families.

34
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,340
<i>We will advance forward
without the injured and ill.</i>

35
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,010
<i>Instead of using horses,
we will use strong bindings and carts.</i>

36
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,490
<i>Send out messages.</i>

37
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,210
<i>Find out the movements of
Gyeongsang-do and Jeolla-do.</i>

38
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,550
Dae Gil, I was so worried about you.

39
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,840
Let's get things organized.

40
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:42,160
By the way, there are people watching...

41
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,590
I wouldn't mind having a sword.

42
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,520
Grandpa, stop thinking useless thoughts.

43
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,290
Go help out over there.

44
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,640
So, only you get to have a sword?

45
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,560
Gather around, everyone!

46
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,240
We'll be handing out food to everyone.

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,410
Take some and go home, everyone.

48
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,650
Don't go around bleeding,
getting broken bones.

49
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,720
Come on, everyone!

50
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,430
Get up and come get your share.

51
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,500
Everyone, come this way!

52
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,910
Over here! Come over here!

53
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,460
You can take this medicine for that.

54
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,930
You should hurry before it gets worse.

55
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,710
Come this way. Over here, everyone!

56
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,770
Here you go.

57
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,850
Here.

58
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,170
Were you cut?

59
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,040
Oh my... where are you from?

60
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,370
Dae Gil.

61
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,880
We've handled the stomach illness.

62
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,080
We also handed out a lot of food,
but we still have plenty left over.

63
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,120
Oh, that's a relief.

64
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,450
You should head outside.
Everyone is waiting to hear from you.

65
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,880
What is going to happen to us?
We took part in a rebellion.

66
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,760
They say anyone who took part in it
will be put to death.

67
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,640
You have all put down your weapons,
so that will never happen.

68
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,830
Is that really true?

69
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,770
The king has promised it.

70
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,600
Anyone who puts down their weapons
will be forgiven.

71
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,630
He was very clear about this.

72
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,070
You may all return home now
with the food you have received.

73
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,170
Is that true?

74
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,390
Did the king promise that?

75
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:05,910
The 50,000 men under your command
have just passed Gwacheon.

76
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,980
However, to stop Jeong Hee Ryang and
Park Pil Hyun's 100,000

77
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,120
that will not be nearly enough.

78
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,570
If we cannot stop them at Anseong...

79
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,340
It's only a matter of time
before we lose the capital city.

80
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,770
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

81
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,900
I have message for you from Mokcheon.

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,800
Baek Dae Gil has
cut their forces in half.

83
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,880
Yi In Jwa's 30,000 men
are reduced to half

84
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,740
but they are still headed to Anseong.

85
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,910
Although he has only half his men

86
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,330
we will lose Anseong
if we do not get there in time.

87
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,670
It will take the military two days
to get to Anseong.

88
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,300
We cannot waste a single moment.

89
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,800
I must go myself.

90
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,610
Your Majesty!

91
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,570
It is too dangerous for you
to go there directly.

92
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,410
They are coming right at me.

93
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,620
Shall I sit idly by and
give up my palace, as well?

94
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,020
We cannot waste another moment.

95
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,780
Prepare to leave at once.

96
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

97
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,420
I'd better send Dae Gil a message.

98
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,310
There is no need.

99
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,630
What do you mean?

100
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:07,630
No matter what happens in the city,
Dae Gil will follow his plan.

101
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,690
His plan?

102
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,140
The rebels should be approximately here.

103
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,280
However, the men will be suffering from
exhaustion as they have not eaten.

104
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,030
They will stop by this village
before heading to Anseong.

105
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,650
My lord, the men are very tired.

106
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,790
It's hard enough to get there
in two days instead of four.

107
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,620
We have no food or horses.

108
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,490
If we continue on like this

109
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,740
they will all pass out
before we arrive in Anseong.

110
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,100
We will rest in the nearby village.

111
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,160
<i>They may end up looting this village.</i>

112
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:16,390
You should take the rest of our food
and go to this village.

113
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,660
This is from your Master, Kim Chae Gun.

114
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,240
<i>I have tracked down Jeong Hee Ryang.</i>

115
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,730
<i>I will keep my promise to you.</i>

116
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,490
<i>I will make sure that innocent people
do not get hurt.</i>

117
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,560
I will have to trust Master
to take care of the South.

118
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,650
And now what?

119
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,690
I'll have to move on to
the next part of the plan.

120
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,410
A three part plan?

121
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:06,940
First, take the horses and provisions
in order to slow down the rebels.

122
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,290
That doesn't sound easy.

123
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,630
The rebels have a weakness.

124
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,200
They've gathered from all eight cities
and do not know one another well.

125
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,260
I recently received a message and
it appears they have succeeded.

126
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,090
Is that true?

127
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,970
Let's stay strong.

128
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,980
We're almost there.

129
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,930
<i>They've lost half of their men.</i>

130
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,790
Then what is the second part?

131
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,820
It will be to stomp out the rebellion
rising up at Cheongju Fortress.

132
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,290
"Yi In Jwa's rebellion has failed."

133
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,420
We will spread that rumor.

134
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,220
Oh, that's a great idea.

135
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,690
<i>No one will be able to verify
the truth of that rumor.</i>

136
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:10,710
<i>Those who considered taking part in the
rebellion will have to be careful.</i>

137
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,810
Where are all of the soldiers?

138
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,240
There's a rumor that's been going around.

139
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,270
There's a rumor that Yi In Jwa
was defeated at Anseong.

140
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,950
How could you be so stupid?

141
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,920
You don't actually
believe that rumor, do you?

142
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,970
I don't necessarily believe it,
but I cannot ignore it either.

143
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,270
I apologize but I can't help you.

144
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,120
I can't give you what I promised.

145
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,640
What do you think you're doing?

146
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:03,350
If you pull out on me now,
you will likely betray me.

147
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,030
I can't let you go.

148
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,780
Why, you rascal...

149
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,660
I suppose this is what
I should expect from a rebel.

150
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,810
Arrest them all, right now!

151
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes, sir!

152
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,080
Stop them!

153
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,420
You had people hiding?

154
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:34,160
I never did trust those who make a
living off the government.

155
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,890
Hold on and watch a little longer.

156
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,160
Dae Gil.

157
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,770
The military has left the palace.

158
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,400
I will give you five days.

159
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,440
If I do not hear from you in five days...

160
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,090
I will use my military.

161
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,320
Grandpa, it's become urgent.

162
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,620
I've got to go now.
Take care of the rest for me.

163
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,430
Where are you going by yourself again?

164
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,400
Anseong.

165
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,550
I have to meet the king
before something happens.

166
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,730
My lord, they've been starving all day.

167
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,660
If we keep going like this...

168
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,000
Find a little more strength, everyone.

169
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,430
According to news we received
from Yeongnam and Honam

170
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,620
it will be two days...
just two more days.

171
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,500
We will be joining 100,000
of our men in Anseong.

172
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,550
Then we will accomplish our great plan.

173
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,810
My lord, look at them.

174
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,340
They will not last half a day,
let alone two days.

175
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,410
Look!

176
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,850
- I think you can eat this.
- It's food!

177
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,010
What is it? Let's see.

178
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,370
You can eat it.

179
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,810
What is it? What is it?

180
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,570
Give it to me! Give me some!

181
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,230
Get me 20 of the best men.

182
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,610
What are you doing? Hurry up.

183
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,370
My lord.

184
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,980
Isn't it wrong to steal food
from these villagers?

185
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,900
It is only enough to get us to Anseong.

186
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,960
Do you want to give up on everything
over a few meals?

187
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,130
Let's load it up.

188
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,720
Hey, stop!

189
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,210
Stop!

190
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,600
You can't do this!

191
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,560
Do you know what this food is to us?

192
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,830
Oh my...

193
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,790
You all deserve to die.

194
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,120
Do you have nothing better to steal that
you'd steal from farmers like us?

195
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,410
If you're going to take this,
you're going to have to kill us first!

196
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,190
You're going to have to kill us!

197
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,590
I won't give this up even if I die,
so go ahead and try!

198
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,690
- That's right!
- Just try it!

199
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,510
Then there's nothing I can do.

200
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,150
I want you to lock them all up in here.

201
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,770
The rest of you should start
loading up the food.

202
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,460
What are you planning to do?

203
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,540
Anyone who holds us back from
heading to Anseong...

204
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,380
I will kill them all.

205
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,790
What? What?

206
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,270
No matter who that is.

207
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,620
What did you say?

208
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,230
Do you want to do this?

209
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,440
Do you?

210
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,760
Why are you telling me
to lock them up in here?

211
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,040
It's a sacrifice for our great plan.
That's all you need to know.

212
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,090
Are you crazy?

213
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,380
I will enrich this nation
and make it stronger.

214
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,720
I will repay their souls.

215
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,690
I can't watch innocent people
die like this.

216
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,000
Are you going to destroy our plans?

217
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,230
Do you really not know that all of this
is a sacrifice for our salvation?

218
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,920
<i>[Jukju Mountain Fortress]</i>

219
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,050
How many soldiers have gathered here?

220
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,170
Right now, there are 35,000.

221
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,420
We will be getting 20,000 more
from Suwon and Yongin.

222
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,840
Where are the rebel troops now?

223
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,450
They have not arrived in Anseong yet.

224
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,960
According to our scout, Baek Dae Gil has
taken Yi In Jwa's horses and provisions.

225
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,800
There is a rumor in Jeolla-do that
Yi In Jwa has been defeated.

226
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,020
It seems this is the work
of Baek Dae Gil.

227
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,460
Is there a reason you are confident
you can stop Yi In Jwa?

228
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,170
Do you have a plan?

229
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:45,270
First, I will use his weakness and
slow down his troop movements.

230
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,320
I will reduce the number
of his men by half.

231
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,420
Second.

232
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,330
What's scarier than
a sword... is a rumor.

233
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,750
Rumor?

234
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

235
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,960
I will use rumors to cut off
Yi In Jwa's arms and legs.

236
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,650
What's your next move after that?

237
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,480
My third plan is...

238
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,500
There are 100,000 men coming from
Jeolla-do and Gyeongsang-do.

239
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,030
Everything will be over if we fail.

240
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,400
Oh, I'm so tired. Goodness.

241
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,830
Oh my...

242
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,650
Oh my.

243
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,240
I know you are all tired.

244
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,540
Hang in there a little longer.

245
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,420
You all look terrible.

246
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,390
What don't you give up now?

247
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,950
Why would you say such a weak thing?

248
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:04,330
This is not the kind of nation I wanted.

249
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,720
I heard that you plundered a village.

250
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,950
It was a choice I had to make.

251
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:20,000
Do you think it was the right choice?

252
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,050
Follow me.

253
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,170
No one has touched the food.

254
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,650
These men are citizens of this land
before they are your troops.

255
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,620
They wished for a better nation,
a nation that was for the people.

256
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,430
That is why they stepped up.

257
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,780
How could they eat food
plundered from villagers?

258
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,330
It is not plunder. It's a sacrifice.

259
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:05,320
What meaning would there be to sit on the
throne after sacrificing the people?

260
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,040
Anseong is within our reach,
Your Highness.

261
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,920
The throne will be yours in half a day.

262
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,220
Have you come this far
by treating people this way?

263
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:25,120
You have plundered a village
and even killed its people.

264
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,020
Why did you do it?

265
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,900
I may be starving...

266
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,730
but w did not want to steal from
innocent people.

267
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,750
I told you all many times
to keep your mouths shut.

268
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,690
I... am here because of His Highness,
Mil Poong Goon.

269
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,000
I am not here because of you.

270
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
What did you say?

271
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,550
If you value your lives...

272
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,180
watch your mouths!

273
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,660
You...

274
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,550
How dare you murder someone in front of
me without a second thought!

275
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,480
Your Highness.

276
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,250
Please trust me.

277
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,500
I promise to you that
I will get you on the throne.

278
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,690
You did not need to kill him!

279
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,550
Bury him somewhere nice.

280
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,820
I'd like to be alone.

281
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,220
I am sorry.

282
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,880
Your Majesty, why haven't you
kept your promise to me?

283
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,840
Didn't you promise to give me five days?

284
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,810
It will be five days today.

285
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,300
So, have you brought me Yi In Jwa?

286
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,610
I know you have accomplished a lot.

287
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,530
You have reduced his troops by half.

288
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:07,450
You slowed his advancement by
taking his horses and provisions.

289
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,330
However... that is all you can do.

290
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:19,520
Now, I will put an end to this rebellion.

291
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:24,300
Are you going to draw your sword
against your own people?

292
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,280
They are your people, your children.

293
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,540
They have deserted me.

294
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,470
So, they will be punished by the sword.

295
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,050
Your Majesty, I did not
use my sword even once.

296
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,240
Do you know how I managed to
reduce Yi In Jwa's troops by half?

297
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,390
It was faith.

298
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,960
<i>It was faith in the people.</i>

299
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,650
Thank you.

300
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,290
Go on and live well now.

301
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,010
That's about 15,000 men.

302
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:06,590
All those men have put down their swords.

303
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,470
What do you think that means?

304
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,140
We can do this.

305
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,440
Without drawing swords
and without drawing blood...

306
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,340
we can end this revolt.

307
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,060
He will arrive here soon.

308
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,970
If we lose control of this place,
it will give them access to the capital.

309
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,690
No matter how many men are in the palace,
it will be difficult to stop them.

310
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,750
So, I am considering
evacuating before then.

311
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,530
It is absolutely imperative...

312
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,810
that we defeat them in this place.

313
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,400
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

314
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,220
The rebels have arrived.

315
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,280
We are finally here in Anseong.

316
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,560
Have we heard anything from
Yeongnam and Honam?

317
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,400
Yeongnam has just left Jincheon.

318
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,330
Honam has passed Pyeongtaek.

319
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,370
It will take half the morning
for them to arrive.

320
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,120
If the soldiers attack us before then...

321
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,850
we are done.

322
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,550
Don't you worry.

323
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,280
I have a hidden card inside.

324
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,960
Look at them.

325
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,870
Those troops...

326
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,100
Do they look like regular people to you?

327
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,180
Kill all the rebels.

328
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,130
Your Majesty!

329
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,040
Yi In Jwa, Mil Poong Goon,
and all the rebels.

330
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,160
Do not leave a single one alive.

331
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,280
<i>Move aside!</i>

332
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,690
You can't do this, Your Majesty.

333
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,400
You dare to disobey me?

334
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,050
They are your people.

335
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,220
They are traitors.

336
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,670
Please be merciful.

337
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,820
They do not know what mercy is.

338
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,140
That is why I fight them with my sword.

339
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,360
What about me?
Will you turn on me, as well?

340
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,890
If you choose to join hands with rebels,
I will cut your throat.

341
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,120
Your Majesty.

342
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,520
I made a promise to the late king
that I would always protect you.

343
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,310
But, from this moment on...

344
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,360
I cannot keep that promise.

345
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,560
What do you think you're doing?

346
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,850
How dare you...

347
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,420
King...

348
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,750
It is time for you to die!

349
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,880
Members of the
defeated party still exist?

350
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,750
The government is so corrupt.

351
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:20,360
Wouldn't it be more odd
if there weren't any?

352
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,340
Since the Queen Dowager
joined forces with me...

353
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,820
two of the military leaders have
turned their backs on the king.

354
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,550
The naive king has come all the way here.

355
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:40,860
He will end up losing his life.

356
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,440
Finally... the king is dead.

357
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,780
The fortress doors will open soon.

358
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,900
We will accomplish our dreams.

359
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:26,170
Now... we will advance to Hanyang!

360
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,940
Are you all ready?

361
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,310
Your Highness, you should enter first.

362
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,840
March forward!

363
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,540
Baek Dae Gil.

364
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,740
Retreat!

365
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,760
Retreat!

366
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,000
From this moment on,
you are no longer rebel troops!

367
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,360
Yi In Jwa had no great plan.

368
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,000
The only thing he had was
self-interest and greed.

369
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Your Highness,
I have been waiting for you.

370
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,790
I heard you were looking for me.

371
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,700
I asked you what the
third part of your plan was.

372
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,040
If the troops in Honam and Yeongnam
are Yi In Jwa's arms

373
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,300
His Highness, Mil Poong Goon,
is the sword in his hand.

374
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,570
The dagger he holds close to his heart
are the spies he's hidden in the palace.

375
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,300
Mil Poong Goon and radicals from the
defeated party are working together.

376
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,930
How will you get them to come out?

377
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:17,110
I will get the rebels following
Mil Poong Goon to come here.

378
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:20,440
You will use Mil Poong Goon as bait?

379
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,830
How will you find out who these spies
are from the defeated party?

380
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,820
I...

381
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,350
will draw my sword and
hold it against your throat.

382
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,030
I had my doubts.

383
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,090
But, there are two of you.

384
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,260
I cannot believe the two of you.

385
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,950
Put down your weapons.

386
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,810
If you all surrender, you will live.

387
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,870
The king has promised this.

388
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:03,580
Put down your weapons
before I change my mind.

389
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,080
Do not be afraid.

390
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,560
The revolt will end soon.

391
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,810
You will all go home soon.

392
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,460
You have saved the people again.

393
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,120
However, your work here is done now.

394
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,610
I will take care of the rest.

395
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,940
- Your Majesty...
- Mil Poong Goon.

396
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,590
I will determine what to do with you
once I deal with this revolt.

397
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,610
Your Majesty!

398
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,760
Your Majesty, pull back your sword.

399
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,520
Soon, 100,000 rebel troops
will come upon this place.

400
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,940
If I lose this opportunity now,
it will be over for the capital city.

401
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,950
Unless I attack first...

402
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,420
Anseong will be seized
along with the capital city.

403
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,730
I'm sure the second part
of my plan will work.

404
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,000
Have you received word?

405
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,860
Has Park Pil Hyun been stopped?

406
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,410
Have you confirmed that
Jeong Hee Ryang has been stopped?

407
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,280
Tonight is the last night.

408
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,840
We barely made it back to camp.

409
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,750
Mil Poong Goon rejected the throne
when it was handed to him.

410
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,800
My lord, it's going to be hard now.

411
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,000
We only had half the men to begin with.

412
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,260
Now, we have lost another half.

413
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,900
Get all the commanding officers in here.

414
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,840
I have something to discuss.

415
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,670
Your Majesty, please reconsider
one more time.

416
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,650
There is nothing you can get
without sacrifice.

417
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,330
How can you force sacrifice
on your people?

418
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:44,000
Once the revolt is over...

419
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,340
I will plead for forgiveness.

420
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,950
I will prepare funerals for them
and give relief to the poor.

421
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,660
You say that I am forcing others to
sacrifice themselves?

422
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,890
As for me...

423
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,490
I am prepared for the disgrace of
being labeled a tyrant.

424
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,180
Your Majesty.

425
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,660
- What is it?
- Just stand here.

426
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,260
Stand right there.

427
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,660
Hold that.

428
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,730
You have to stand there.

429
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,450
What do I do?

430
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:23,710
But, what are we standing here for?

431
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,650
<i>They will all die!</i>

432
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,030
We still have over 8,000 men.

433
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,320
We can hold out.

434
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,580
Park Pil Hyun and Jeong Hee Ryang
will join us soon.

435
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,200
The military will have over
five times as many men.

436
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,490
Do you really not know this?

437
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,170
My lord, this isn't right.

438
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,530
- This isn't right.
- We've come this far!

439
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,850
Do you know what it took to get this far?

440
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,930
Victory is right in front of us.

441
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,850
So many died for this.

442
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,990
Have you forgotten the tens of thousands
who have died to make this happen?

443
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,560
Tonight...

444
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,760
there will be an attack.

445
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,850
Tonight...

446
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,670
I will order an attack myself.

447
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,690
The military is here.

448
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,540
The time has finally come.

449
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,360
Are you ready?

450
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

451
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,810
Attack!

452
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,070
Stop!

453
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,060
Your Majesty, please stop.

454
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,450
It is too late.

455
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,060
Those people standing there
are just shields.

456
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,250
They are rebels who have
committed treason.

457
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:55,820
Kill them all.
Do not leave anyone standing.

458
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:20,700
Shoot!

459
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,860
Get up.

460
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,840
Wake up and open your eyes.

461
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,990
Hey!

462
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:23,600
Wake up!

463
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:36,840
Stop!

464
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:39,530
Please stop.

465
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,230
Take a good look at what's going on.

466
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:49,840
Is this... is this the great plan
that you wanted so badly?

467
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,560
You cannot achieve anything great
without making sacrifices.

468
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:59,290
Stand guard and stop them from entering!

469
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,660
Aim.

470
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,760
Your Majesty!

471
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:38,720
Stop, stop!

472
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,030
Stop!

473
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,780
Please don't shoot! You can't do this.

474
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,860
Please spare them.

475
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,160
Stop the attack.

476
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,800
Seol Im...

477
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:18,100
<i>Your Majesty, please trust me.</i>

478
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,660
<i>That is very commendable of you.</i>

479
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:25,760
However, I have no intention of

480
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,390
protecting those who
took part in the revolt.

481
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:31,990
Then, I will show you.

482
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,850
I will show you whether they are
really rebels or just good people.

483
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:37,950
What?

484
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,510
Please just watch.

485
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,280
<i>I will show you.</i>

486
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,280
Attention.

487
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,510
Stop the attack.

488
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:56,740
Baek Dae Gil.

489
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,790
It is not over yet.

490
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,890
You are finished.

491
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:02,710
However...

492
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,290
you do have a choice to make.

493
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,930
The lives of everyone here

494
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,630
will depend on the choice that you make.

495
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:24,410
If we cared about our lives,
we would not have started this at all.

496
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,750
I, Yi In Jwa...

497
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:32,260
can be buried here,
in this spot, with all of these people.

498
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:38,280
I will join hands with you.

499
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,950
After all this time,
you say you will join me?

500
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,060
Baek Dae Gil, you?

501
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,360
You have lost many people
that were following you.

502
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,610
Mil Poong Goon has
turned his back on you.

503
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:00,100
You have no right to the throne.

504
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,470
So, what?

505
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,170
I will promise you
with my life on the line.

506
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:09,750
If you can prove to me
that you are right...

507
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,070
I will do it.

508
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,860
Prove myself?

509
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:17,900
How will I prove myself?

510
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,160
Let's leave it to the heavens.

511
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,720
What?

512
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,950
Your Majesty, we should not
sit here and watch.

513
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:33,570
Your Majesty?

514
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,090
Wait.

515
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:52,120
Do you remember this coin?

516
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:01,700
<i>I put my life on the line
for this one coin.</i>

517
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,120
<i>It also saved my life.</i>

518
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:11,080
This coin changed my life.

519
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:18,690
So, this will decide our fate
and the fate of Joseon.

520
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,130
Let's put it all on this one round.

521
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:30,760
All right.

522
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:33,870
Let's do that.

523
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,620
Let's be clear about this one thing.

524
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,900
Make this promise in front of
all the people here.

525
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,410
If I win...

526
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,350
give up on everything.

527
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:50,130
If you do end up winning...

528
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,140
I will give up on my plan.

529
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,520
Make your choice.

530
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,460
Front side.

531
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,790
The side with the words
"Sang Pyung Tong Bo."

532
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,960
Then, I choose the back.

533
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:35,260
I am curious.

534
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:39,830
Will the heavens choose you?

535
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:44,250
Or will they choose me, Yi In Jwa?

536
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,620
Do you know what?

537
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,790
I don't make bets
unless I'm sure I'll win.

538
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:15,800
As you promised, give up
on everything and go to prison.

539
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:32,510
I'm sorry, but I can't keep my promise.

540
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,500
Yi In Jwa.

541
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:38,240
After tonight...

542
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:43,430
a large group of rebel troops from
Yeongnam and Honam will join us.

543
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:50,390
Do you think 100,000 men won't be able
to take Jukju Mountain Fortress?

544
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:59,750
Jeong Hee Ryang and Park Pil Hyun
are finished already.

545
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,180
What are you talking about?

546
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,130
They are finished already.

547
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,910
<i>Park Pil Hyun from Honam had been
tied down to begin with.</i>

548
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,310
You were not farmers, after all.

549
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,600
<i>It's the same for
Jeong Hee Ryang in Yeongnam.</i>

550
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:51,010
I received messages from them.

551
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:52,730
They told me they would be arriving soon.

552
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:57,600
Was that you?

553
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,600
You don't think I only
tied them down, do you?

554
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,430
Whether or not you end up dying...

555
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,720
you ought to repent for your crimes.

556
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:27,640
Then... even Park Pil Hyun?

557
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:45,170
I heard that Yi In Jwa is
leaving blood wherever he goes.

558
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:48,740
A great plan that involves the killing
of innocent people.

559
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,820
So, this is the "great plan"
you all talked about?

560
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:54,340
You shouldn't dare to speak his name.

561
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:57,250
He is not someone to speak of that way.

562
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:05,080
I will make sure to see if you're so
talkative once you are beheaded.

563
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,640
Please go on with your work.

564
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,370
There are no support troops coming.

565
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,640
So, give up now.

566
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,590
Your greedy ambition will never happen.

567
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,740
What did you say?

568
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,250
What are you doing? Take him now!

569
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:54,950
Hwang Jin Ki.

570
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,120
What are you doing?

571
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,440
You said so yourself.

572
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,270
A nation for the people...

573
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:24,320
You said you'd get a king for the people.

574
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:30,000
Not only could you not feed the
starving people.

575
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:35,950
You used the stomachs of the people
as a shield for arrows!

576
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,680
I was very conflicted about it.

577
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,100
Should I let you live?

578
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,950
Or... should I die with you?

579
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:52,800
You were someone I considered
my master at one time.

580
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,420
It should be me who sends you off.

581
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:03,460
Let's not make this any worse
than it has to be.

582
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:08,600
No!

583
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,850
His life belongs to the people.

584
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,090
Now is not the time.

585
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,330
Put down your weapons and surrender!

586
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:29,980
Put down your weapons!

587
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,710
- Arrest him!
- Yes, sir.

588
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:51,410
Yi In Jwa.

589
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,340
It is over now.

590
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,650
Dae Gil...

591

<i>I have come here because they say there
is a man who pretends to be a king.</i>

602
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:01,250
<i>I have come to kill you today.</i>
