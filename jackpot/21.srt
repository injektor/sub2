4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,990
Baek Dae Gil, what are your
true intentions?

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,380
You pushed Yi In Jwa away
and pushed me away.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,320
Are you planning on making him a king?

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,840
That is very unjust of you.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,190
Or did you think because we are all
of the same lineage

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,930
that I would let you two brothers live?

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,870
Did you think I didn't know?

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:47,750
Today... I will end this insufferable
relationship.

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,360
Move aside!

13
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,350
The late king had a dying wish.

14
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,110
He said the Noron faction would
not accept you as king.

15
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,010
He said the Soron faction would most
definitely use it to their advantage.

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,500
I was told to save Yeoning's life.
I was told to save my brother's life.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,960
So I responded, "Yes, Your Majesty.
I promise to protect Yeoning's life."

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,480
"As his older brother,
I will put my life on the line".

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,100
That was what I promised him.

20
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,580
Father's dying wish...

21
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,990
was for this traitor to live?

22
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,460
Are you there?

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,190
Is he speaking the truth?

24
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,950
Yes, Your Majesty...

25
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,740
Father has saved your life.

26
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,540
However, this will be the last time
I forgive you.

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,210
Also, as for the Noron faction's
refusal to accept me as king...

28
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,830
I cannot forgive them.

29
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,300
- They will all be punished by execution.
- Your Majesty!

30
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,710
Your Majesty!

31
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,860
Also...

32
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,510
Crown Prince, protect yourself.
Do not take part in government affairs.

33
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,870
Do you understand?

34
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,140
What are you doing?

35
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,840
What should I do?

36
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,130
The lives of the Noron ministers...

37
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,590
How do I save them?

38
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,860
I will look for a way. Do not be rash.
Wait here. All right?

39
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,990
Speak!

40
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,030
Tell us what we want to know!

41
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,440
You rascals!

42
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,830
Your Majesty!

43
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,290
Cheers.

44
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,850
<i>Evidence?</i>

45
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,000
<i>[I swear on my blood to help my
brothers in arms to defend the country.]</i>

46
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,590
It's a blood oath between
Yi In Jwa and the rebel Jeong.

47
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,730
Your Majesty, those who committed treason

48
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,630
and got the Noron
to name a successor....

49
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,970
The assassin that came in the night, the
poison in your food, and the gossip.

50
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,500
The ones who disgraced you
and caused trouble in the government.

51
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,160
That was all Yi In Jwa. Please forgive
the Noron faction.

52
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,950
Please execute the rebel Yi In Jwa.

53
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:29,380
If Yi In Jwa is also a rebel,
I will execute him as well.

54
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,940
It does not excuse the Noron faction
of their crimes.

55
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,190
Your Majesty

56
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,960
naming Yeoning as the successor
and the Crown Prince Regent...

57
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,870
Are you trying to say that it was all
Yi In Jwa?

58
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,870
The Noron faction members are not
the puppets of Yi In Jwa.

59
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,190
Also, it is not important whether there
was an act of treason or not.

60
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:03,670
What's important is that they had that
feelings in their hearts.

61
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,380
They have never once accepted me as king.

62
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,300
That is the reason why they must die.

63
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,320
- But, Your Majesty...
- I will not say it twice.

64
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,570
The Noron ministers and Yi In Jwa...

65
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,330
I will punish them as I see fit.

66
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,180
What happened?

67
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,430
I could not stop the executions of the
Noron faction ministers.

68
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,210
<i>[Jo Tae Chae, Yi Gun Myung,
Yi Yi Myung, Kim Chang Jib]</i>

69
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,310
<i>[Kim Chae Gun]</i>

70
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,720
Your Majesty!

71
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,710
Please spare their lives.
Punish me instead.

72
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,190
Please take my life.

73
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,560
Save the lives of the ministers,
Your Majesty!

74
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,040
Was it all your doing?

75
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,960
Did you get them to take action to
dethrone me?

76
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,880
Was it you who made them treat me like
a king in title only and insult me?

77
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,520
- Was it all you?
- Your Majesty...

78
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,610
They made an error in judgment out
of loyalty to me.

79
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,930
Then they deserve to die,
so why are you here on their behalf?

80
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,720
Your Majesty, please.

81
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,130
I have no intention of forgiving those
who even think of rebelling.

82
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,710
Even if... it is my brother.

83
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,230
Your Majesty... Your Majesty.

84
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
<i>[Kim Chang Jib]</i>

85
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,160
Make way!

86
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,810
Crown Prince.

87
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,920
Step aside!

88
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,480
We did what was best for this nation
and its people.

89
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,750
How could it be treasonous?

90
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,080
Your subject, Kim Chang Jib, will protect
you and keep the promise I made.

91
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,400
Minister.

92
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,660
Your Highness, please trust me.

93
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,560
Minister...

94
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,310
Crown Prince!

95
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,800
You must stand tall until the end!

96
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:25,730
Your must survive and reform this
nation's government!

97
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,920
Stop...

98
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,590
Stop... stop! Stop!

99
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,770
Stop! I said stop!

100
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,490
Move!

101
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,720
Stop!

102
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:12,800
Move! Move aside!
Move, move!

103
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,010
You must endure it.
You cannot step in and get injured.

104
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,140
They cannot die.

105
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:34,440
What have they even done wrong?
What have they done?

106
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,790
I am sorry.

107
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,880
I promise you...

108
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:20,280
<i>I will get vengeance on your behalf.</i>

109
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,690
Trust me.

110
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,510
And wait for me.

111
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,070
I am sorry.

112
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,040
Leave me alone.

113
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,870
I said leave me alone, please.

114
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,430
Please, leave me alone.

115
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,910
Mother.

116
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,450
Now...

117
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,200
What am I to do?

118
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,870
<i>Father...</i>

119
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,380
<i>I do not want to lose anymore.</i>

120
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:03,010
<i>I do not want to lose any more
of my people.</i>

121
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,250
Dae Gil.

122
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,510
Are you all right?

123
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,700
How is the Crown Prince?

124
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,370
You should have stayed with him.

125
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,780
Why did you come back?
I'm sure he must be traumatized.

126
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,590
There was nothing that I could do
for him.

127
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,110
You asked to see me, Your Majesty?

128
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,440
Tell me.

129
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,650
What should I do about the Crown Prince?

130
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:50,910
If you do not pull out the roots
of a rebellion it will rise up again.

131
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,380
You should take his life.

132
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:03,460
About a hundred Noron were killed.

133
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,370
You were the one to persuade the
Noron ministers.

134
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,310
You instigated this incident and
led them to death.

135
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,470
That's not true, Your Majesty.

136
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,320
What power do I have that I could get
the Noron ministers to take action?

137
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,760
Then what power do you have that you
can get me take action?

138
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,650
Am I a easier person than the ministers
in your eyes?

139
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,510
Eunuch.

140
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,200
<i>Has my time finally come?</i>

141
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,370
Are you going to deny this blood oath,
as well?

142
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,600
Your Majesty.

143
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,460
- Crown Prince.
- You should leave.

144
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,640
Right now...

145
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,070
I do not wish to see anyone.

146
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,530
I do not wish to hear anything.

147
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,460
The king has made a decision.

148
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,340
The king is kicking Yi In Jwa out of
the palace.

149
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,050
Your Majesty, I have never committed any
acts of treason.

150
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,940
Are your going to make denials even
in front of this blood oath?

151
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,960
Your Majesty, it is true that I wrote
this contract.

152
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,530
However, all of this...

153
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,470
I did it for your sake...
to get you on the throne.

154
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,770
Have you already forgotten, Your Majesty?

155
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:15,130
Don't you recall how the late king and
Noron ministers used to treat you?

156
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,260
Don't you remember how Yeoning behaved?

157
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,390
<i>They were cold and neglected you.</i>

158
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,670
<i>They threatened you.</i>

159
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:37,690
The promise that I made you,
I held it deep in my heart.

160
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,560
You should sit on the throne,
Crown Prince.

161
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,570
I will just accept your heart.

162
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,620
This was all for you, Your Majesty.

163
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,800
I did it all out of my loyalty to you
and to get you to the throne.

164
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,990
Do you really not know this?

165
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,110
Your loyalty...

166
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,740
I do acknowledge it.

167
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,900
I cannot forget it.

168
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:34,330
However, just as you said,
rebellion can rise up again.

169
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,560
In return for me sparing your life...

170
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,980
you will not be able to step inside this
palace ever again.

171
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,780
You will lose everything that you own.

172
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,080
Your Majesty, why don't you kill
me instead?

173
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,380
I am asking you.

174
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,900
Do not involve yourself in government
affairs again.

175
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,960
Your Majesty!

176
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:15,150
The rebel Jeong
will be executed tomorrow.

177
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,060
<i>I endured all that time.</i>

178
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,850
<i>I worked so hard to get this card.</i>

179
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,860
<i>Must I throw it out now?</i>

180
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,450
<i>In such a wasteful way...</i>

181
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,610
<i>We must throw out a sword that has
become dull.</i>

182
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,160
The Noron ministers have all
been purged.

183
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,000
The king's feelings
have changed as well.

184
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,760
We do not need to carry a useless sword.

185
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,520
Are you all planning to turn on me too?

186
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,790
You joined hands with the rebel Jeong.

187
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,000
We have heard about that blood oath!

188
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:19,000
Leave! We no longer
have any business with you.

189
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,300
You will turn your back on me?

190
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,140
Are you sure you will not regret this?

191
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,690
Are you threatening us?

192
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,250
The king has favored you
because you were his teacher.

193
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,330
How could he continue a relationship with
someone who joined hands with a rebel?

194
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,930
Get out of here!

195
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,560
He will lose everything.

196
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,820
- The king will take everything--
- So what?

197
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,940
Will that change anything?

198
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,660
Yi In Jwa...

199
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,860
I'll get rid of him.

200
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,110
All those people that died because of
schemes will not come back.

201
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,650
<i>[Jeong Hee Ryang]</i>

202
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:53,750
- It's been a long time, Jeong Hee Ryang.
- Have you had a change of heart?

203
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,430
Well, they do say the soul looks good
if you die while eating.

204
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,950
They say you will be executed tomorrow.

205
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:24,400
I think you need to die
in order for me to live.

206
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:35,780
The body may rot for a moment,
but the soul will not leave the body.

207
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,300
What is it?

208
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,150
You need to stand up again.

209
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,930
For all those that died for you,
you must stand up again!

210
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,050
Crown Prince!

211
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,840
The rebel Jeong and his people have taken
their own lives by consuming poison.

212
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,420
<i>I heard that the criminals have all died.</i>

213
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,030
You wanted to keep the rebel Jeong alive.

214
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:08,200
And dig deeper into his background.
Haven't your plans failed then?

215
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,980
Not yet.

216
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,660
It is win or lose now.

217
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,710
I need you to mobilize the Euigeumbu,
Office of the Inspector General

218
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,610
the police, and the Hansung
Regional District.

219
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,010
We need to tighten the noose around
Yi In Jwa's throat.

220
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,700
Eunuchs.

221
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,150
The king turned his back on you?

222
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,730
- Yes.
- How did that happen?

223
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,500
What is the reason?

224
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,170
The king ended up receiving
the blood oath.

225
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,690
But, I'm sure that...

226
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,390
The contract that Hong Mae burned...

227
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,160
<i>was a fake.</i>

228
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,700
<i>She probably gave the real copy to
Baek Dae Gil.</i>

229
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,470
However, it doesn't matter.

230
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,340
Our plans will have to move forward.

231
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,470
The King was a card we would have
eventually thrown away .

232
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,410
<i>- Take everything!
- Yes, Sir.</i>

233
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,790
What's going on?

234
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,330
Sorry about the interruption.
I'm carrying out a royal command.

235
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,370
Royal command?

236
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,740
You will lose everything you own.

237
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,110
Police Chief, you are making
a big mistake.

238
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,740
I'm from the Hansung Regional Office
to investigate a matter.

239
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,030
It looks like I'm late.

240
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,400
I'm here from the Office of
the Inspector General.

241
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,520
What did you say?

242
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:20,530
Why don't you turn yourself in to
the Euigeumbu tomorrow?

243
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,350
Before a warrant is released.

244
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,660
My lord, what will you do now?

245
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:44,740
It seems that the king is out to kill me.

246
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,140
<i>He is already a man headed toward death.</i>

247
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,620
<i>I had planned on using him a
little longer.</i>

248
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:57,240
If he insists on being this way,
I will have to strike first.

249
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,440
What are you planning to do?

250
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,580
In case something like this happened,
I had a plan in place.

251
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,850
<i>[Park Pil Hyun]</i>

252
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,280
Is it you?

253
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,750
Are you Yi In Jwa's partner,
Park Pil Hyun?

254
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,730
I'm Jeong Hee Ryang from Yongnam.

255
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,230
I have a blood oath with Yi In Jwa.

256
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,680
We cannot lose this opportunity.

257
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,020
Make your decision.

258
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,850
He has finally drawn his sword.

259
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,640
Send a message to our comrades.

260
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,440
Tomorrow, at midday...

261
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:54,490
I, Park Pil Hyun, will be charging into
the city.

262
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,170
Yes, Sir.

263
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:04,980
It looks like the city will be turned
upside down tomorrow.

264
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,420
Are you certain Yi In Jwa will
make a move tomorrow?

265
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,760
He will make a move.

266
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,320
Otherwise, he will end up dying.

267
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,280
Crown Prince, you need to eat something.

268
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,710
Crown Prince.

269
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,960
We will kill the King.

270
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,480
Then we will start a new world.

271
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,510
<i>King, all of the things I have done for
you all these years...</i>

272
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,050
<i>I will take it all back today.</i>

273
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:30,970
Who are you?

274
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,380
- I am Yi In Jwa.
- Yi In Jwa, you say?

275
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,180
What brings you here?

276
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,210
I have waited a very long time for you.

277
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,890
Why is the bell ringing?

278
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,370
I will check on it.

279
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,630
Why is the bell ringing?

280
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,580
<i>First, the bell rang five times.</i>

281
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,540
<i>The second time, the bell rang
nine times.</i>

282
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,930
<i>The fifth word in the Celestial Stem
is "Mu."</i>

283
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:33,240
<i>The ninth word in the Earthly Branch is
"Shin."</i>

284
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,520
<i>"Mu Shin."</i>

285
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,330
"Mu Shin."

286
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,210
Just now...

287
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,830
how many times did the bell ring?

288
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
Pardon me?

289
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,580
Everyone, rise up!

290
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:19,370
It is your nation, the people's nation!

291
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,620
It has arrived at your door!

292
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,860
<i>Those that have fallen into ruin...</i>

293
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,750
<i>Those of you whose families have been
killed and have suffered in fear...</i>

294
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,700
<i>Those of you that shed tears because
of this corrupted government....</i>

295
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,660
<i>All of you, stand up!</i>

296
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,870
<i>Let us start a new world together.</i>

297
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,120
It's a royal command.

298
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,810
Arrest all officials in charge
of administrative and executive affairs.

299
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,280
Was this it?

300
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,520
Is this everything?

301
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,590
The rebels that you planted inside
the palace...

302
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,070
How did you know?

303
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,800
I expected that there could be rebels
within the palace.

304
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,290
But I wasn't certain.

305
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,950
I wondered how you would
mobilize them all at once.

306
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,660
But...

307
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,140
I became certain once you rang that bell.

308
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,060
Then are they all...

309
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,030
Go on and arrest them!

310
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,150
Yes, sir!

311
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,160
It's over now.

312
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,850
Yi In Jwa.

313
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:32,800
I truly wanted it...
I wanted you to become King.

314
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:36,720
I heard you were a genius
and could see into the future.

315
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,670
You must not have been able to read
my face very well.

316
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,840
How could you think I look like someone
who'd become a king?

317
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:51,520
Do you really want to die by my sword?

318
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,080
Do you think you can do it?

319
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,030
- Dae Gil!
- Stop.

320
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,850
I saw it, the rebellious nature
in your heart.

321
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,000
Your Majesty, it's a very big
misunderstanding.

322
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,630
What did I even do? There is no evidence.

323
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,870
Evidence!

324
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,110
Why? Will you try denying more?

325
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,990
<i>King, it's not over yet. You will see.</i>

326
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,820
<i>There will be no trial.</i>

327
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,570
<i>Your face will be revealed to
the people.</i>

328
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:18,520
<i>Once it gets dark,
you will be hanged to death in public</i>

329
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,320
<i>to make sure no one thinks of committing
such acts again.</i>

330
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,680
Rebel? That man is a rebel?

331
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,740
- Oh my! How could he do such a thing?
- So, this is that rebel traitor?

332
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,740
Goodness, he looks like a normal person.
Don't you have anything better to do?

333
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,470
You awful man!

334
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:45,120
- What kind of a person...
- Just take out his eyeballs now!

335
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:48,000
He's going to die anyhow.

336
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,670
He deserves to lose them now.
Don't you agree?

337
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,040
- That's right!
- Yeah!

338
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:00,970
Yes, he also took advantage of
poor people. That guy!

339
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,250
- You bum!
- You bum! Jerk!

340
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,430
Yi In Jwa.

341
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:25,930
Baek Dae Gil! You should have killed me.

342
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,150
You insult me like this instead?

343
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,740
How dare you.

344
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,750
How dare you do this to me,
Yi In Jwa!

345
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,660
I'm sure it's torturous for you.

346
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,410
Did you think about why the King decided
to punish you like this?

347
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:50,820
It's to show the rest of your followers
your pathetic last moments.

348
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,550
That way, they won't try another
rebellion.

349
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,470
How much do you know, exactly?

350
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,940
- Park Pil Hyun.
- How do you know about him?

351
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,660
What do you think my father's been up to
after he left me?

352
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,060
What has Baek Man Geum done?

353
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:25,740
From the beginning, I knew that
Jeong Hee Ryang was not dead.

354
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,980
<i>You likely used a medicine that slowed
down his heartbeat.</i>

355
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,800
<i>I let him go on purpose.</i>

356
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,630
<i>A rat caught in the palace
was looking for a way out.</i>

357
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,240
<i>He won't be able to get into the city,
in the end.</i>

358
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,270
Well, I'll see you when
the sun goes down.

359
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,470
You worked very hard.

360
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,820
The blood will not stop flowing
in the palace.

361
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:42,550
I do not have much time left.

362
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,420
You're not getting better.

363
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,330
So, I added some medicinal herbs that
should help.

364
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,410
How much time do I have left?

365
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,150
Your Majesty, why would you say such
a thing?

366
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,150
I have been ill a long time.

367
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,570
I am fully aware of my situation.

368
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,800
Tell me.

369
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,750
How much time do I have left?

370
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,360
<i>The King is naturally weak.</i>

371
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:37,910
In the end, he will end up embracing
Yeoning again.

372
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:42,730
I suppose he will since he does not
have an heir.

373
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,930
There are no other options.

374
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,410
He cannot get rid of Yeoning.

375
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:07,220
At this rate, what if we all end up
dead?

376
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,230
We have to do something before then.

377
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,220
Even if that means we shake the stability
of the royal family

378
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:19,310
I will not stand by and watch the son of
a lowly, water maid become a king.

379
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,840
Let's go.

380
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,300
<i>What happened to Jeong and Park?</i>

381
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,190
<i>It's a relief they have escaped.</i>

382
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,750
<i>Will our great plan fail?</i>

383
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,050
<i>Get a horse. </i>

384
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,630
- Crown Prince.
- Do not worry.

385
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,850
I will not lie down and be weak
like they want me to.

386
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,360
Crown Prince, Crown Prince!

387
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,940
Crown Prince, Crown Prince!

388
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,190
Crown Prince!

389
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,890
It was not poison.

390
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:03,590
However, if you eat the wrong taproot
of a plant...

391
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,800
it can cause death in serious cases.

392
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,220
I cannot die like this.

393
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,970
Crown Prince, you must lie down.

394
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:27,420
I need to see the King.

395
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,320
What happened to them?

396
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,990
Park Pil Hyun and Jeong Hee Ryang must
have found out.

397
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,770
They already disappeared.

398
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,370
The royal guards will come after us.

399
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,170
The four gates are shut to us.

400
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,050
I will leave through Naksan.

401
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:01,030
Yes, they say it is darkest under an
oil lamp.

402
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,230
Be careful out there.

403
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,430
<i>Yi In Jwa's execution has to carried out.</i>

404
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:26,800
<i>It has to be.</i>

405
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,020
Save me, Your Majesty.

406
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:36,140
The ministers are plotting to kill me.

407
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,030
I'm sure they are.

408
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:46,230
The Noron ministers who were loyal
to me tried to get rid of me.

409
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,980
You are only a Crown Prince.

410
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,170
I'm sure they would try to kill you.

411
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,260
Please stop them.

412
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:02,400
Your Majesty, you are the only one who
can stop the Soron faction.

413
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:08,760
I have no inclination to stop the
Soron faction.

414
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:10,820
None whatsoever.

415
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,900
Then...

416
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,570
are you saying I should just accept it?

417
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:32,630
<i>I refuse... to die like this.</i>

418
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,560
The wind is chilly.

419
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,970
Let's go inside.

420
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,360
What do you think?

421
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,680
It is very beautiful.

422
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,180
Do you think so?

423
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,960
To me, it looks very sad.

424
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:08,420
Once the sun sets,
it is gone without a trace.

425
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,050
It feels empty and destroyed.

426
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,300
<i>[Queen Seonui]</i>

427
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:20,080
I am worried about you being left alone
without an heir.

428
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:22,880
Your Majesty.

429
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,990
How will you protect yourself from harm?

430
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,360
You must stay strong.

431
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:37,170
As long as I sit on the throne,
I belong to all the people.

432
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:43,130
My fate is keeping the royal family
stable and serving the people.

433
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,210
However...

434
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:59,050
I am very sorry.

435
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,890
What do you plan on doing once
Yi In Jwa is dead?

436
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:18,800
I will decide once he dies.

437
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,420
Stop!

438
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,250
Get him!

439
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,860
Go on without me. I'll stop them.

440
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,720
I will see you again.

441
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:10,440
So, you're here?

442
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,880
Go on without me.

443
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,210
Stop!

444
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,710
Stop right there! Stop!

445
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,680
My lord.

446
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,640
Over there! There he goes!

447
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,940
Get him! Get him!

448
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,030
Lend me your bow and arrow.

449
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:35,060
<i>Yi In Jwa, I cannot allow you to live.</i>

450
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:55,370
No matter how much you fight,
hell will be waiting for you in the end.

451
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:01,450
Then I'll see you in hell, Kim Chae Gun.

452
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,200
Stop!

453
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,170
<i>Go to hell, Yi In Jwa. </i>

454
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,460
My lord.

455
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,210
- Check the body.
- Yes, sir!

456
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:05,890
What happened here?

457
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:19,340
Hwang Jin Ki chose suicide at the end
of a cliff.

458
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,000
Your Majesty...

459
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:34,070
I have heard that you haven't eaten
in two days.

460
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,660
Bring it in.

461
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,300
<i>Have you made your decision?</i>

462
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,730
I will bring in your court lady to test
your food.

463
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:02,910
No, don't.

464
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,010
You may leave now.

465
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,870
Yeoning.

466
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,890
I am sorry.

467
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,520
<i>As for forgiveness...</i>

468
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:45,620
<i>I will plead for forgiveness from you...</i>

469
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,860
