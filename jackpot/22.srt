28
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,810
<font color="yellow">The King has died.</font>

32
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,790
<font color="yellow">Do not show that face of yours again.</font>

33
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,480
<font color="yellow">I do not have much time left.</font>

34
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
<font color="yellow">Will that change anything?</font>

35
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,600
<font color="yellow">Will it bring back the lives of
all those that died for nothing?</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>Crown Prince! It wasn't you, was it?</i></font>

<font color="yellow">- Let go of me!
- Minister.</font>

38
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,590
<font color="yellow">I just met with the doctor.</font>

39
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,980
<font color="yellow">He told me that His Majesty died
after eating raw crab in soy sauce.</font>

40
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,290
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want to say?</font>

41
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,090
<font color="yellow">The King has been ill for a long time
and has been coughing up blood.</font>

42
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,550
<font color="yellow">How could you give him raw crab
in soy sauce and persimmons?</font>

43
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,420
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that those foods can
cause him harm due to his health?</font>

44
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,770
<font color="yellow">I am heart-broken to hear
that the King died as well.</font>

45
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,970
<font color="yellow">I had not heard that he died
from eating the food.</font>

46
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,990
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right?</font>

47
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,100
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

48
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,910
<font color="yellow">Who are you to insult the heir to
the throne for serving the King a meal?</font>

49
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,680
<font color="yellow">In your eyes, do I not
look like a crown prince?</font>

50
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,840
<font color="yellow">Leave, right now.</font>

51
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,280
<font color="yellow">Crown Prince, what happened?</font>

52
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,750
<font color="yellow">It's just as you heard.</font>

53
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,740
<font color="yellow">I served the King his favorite food</font>

54
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,770
<font color="yellow">raw crab in soy sauce
and sweet persimmons.</font>

55
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,720
<font color="yellow">Please tell me. Did you really...</font>

56
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,370
<font color="yellow">Are you suggesting that
I poisoned the King?</font>

57
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,550
<font color="yellow">Can you tell me that you did not?</font>

58
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,940
<font color="yellow">If you didn't do it,
please tell me that you didn't.</font>

59
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,850
<font color="yellow">Tell me you have nothing to hide.</font>

60
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,400
<font color="yellow">Tell me you have nothing
to hide as the next king.</font>

61
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,950
<font color="yellow">I am your friend, Baek Dae Gil, who
would put his life on the line for you.</font>

62
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,560
<font color="yellow">Tell me you have nothing to hide.</font>

63
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,510
<font color="yellow">Please tell me that.</font>

64
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,570
<font color="yellow">If I tell you that I didn't do it...</font>

65
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,500
<font color="yellow">would you believe me?</font>

66
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,270
<font color="yellow">We were once friends.</font>

67
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,940
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's possible to
have friends in my position?</font>

68
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,100
<font color="yellow">I can be your friend if you want.</font>

69
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,840
<font color="yellow">I don't need a friend like you.</font>

70
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,100
<font color="yellow"><i>We were once brothers too.</i></font>

71
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,060
<font color="yellow">Are there younger brothers
who draw swords</font>

72
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,430
<font color="yellow">against their older brothers?</font>

73
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,790
<font color="yellow">Are there older brothers
that get in the way of</font>

74
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,770
<font color="yellow">their younger brother's success?</font>

75
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,170
<font color="yellow">I trust you, Crown Prince.</font>

76
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,560
<font color="yellow">However, your heart...</font>

77
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,190
<font color="yellow">Once you allowed suspicion
into your heart...</font>

78
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,980
<font color="yellow">you've already thrown me away.</font>

79
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,090
<font color="yellow">Crown Prince.</font>

80
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,590
<font color="yellow">I am not the crown prince.</font>

81
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,360
<font color="yellow">I am the king.</font>

82
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,770
<font color="yellow">I will never be insulted for being
the lowly son of a water maid again.</font>

83
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,270
<font color="yellow">Anyone who disobeys me,
scorns me, or disgraces me...</font>

84
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,340
<font color="yellow">I will not forgive them.</font>

85
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,670
<font color="yellow">Not my parents or my brothers.</font>

86
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,890
<font color="yellow">I have nothing more to say to you.</font>

87
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,750
<font color="yellow">You should leave now.</font>

88
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,990
<font color="yellow">Crown Prince.</font>

89
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,560
<font color="yellow">The Crown Prince is not wrong.</font>

90
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,950
<font color="yellow">This is no longer something
you should get involved in.</font>

91
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,210
<font color="yellow">He is no longer...</font>

92
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,050
<font color="yellow">your friend.</font>

93
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,670
<font color="yellow">Dae Gil, are you really leaving?</font>

94
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,380
<font color="yellow">Don't bother trying to stop him.</font>

95
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,960
<font color="yellow">He is as stubborn as his father.</font>

96
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,860
<font color="yellow">He's already left home a hundred times.</font>

97
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,040
<font color="yellow">Grandpa.</font>

98
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,660
<font color="yellow">Who's there?</font>

99
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,950
<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

100
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,330
<font color="yellow">Man Geum!</font>

101
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,710
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

102
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,600
<font color="yellow">Man Geum!</font>

103
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,060
<font color="yellow">Why you, rascal!</font>

104
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,300
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much Dae Gil and I
suffered after you died?</font>

105
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,850
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you just stay dead?</font>

106
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,950
<font color="yellow">Why did you come back
to this corrupted world?</font>

107
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,630
<font color="yellow">Did you think I would dance around
happily if I saw you again?</font>

108
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,230
<font color="yellow">Thank you...</font>

109
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,060
<font color="yellow">for protecting our Dae Gil.</font>

110
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,130
<font color="yellow">Man Geum...</font>

111
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,650
<font color="yellow">Man Geum! Is this a dream or real life?</font>

112
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, Man Geum.</font>

113
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,700
<font color="yellow">You want all of us to leave together?</font>

114
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,160
<font color="yellow">Where to?</font>

115
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,260
<font color="yellow">To a place where we can help people
and live well together.</font>

116
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,560
<font color="yellow">You'll see once you get there.</font>

117
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,020
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. It's a good place.</font>

118
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,960
<font color="yellow">Where is this good place?</font>

119
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,500
<font color="yellow">You should go if you've made
the decision to go.</font>

120
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,500
<font color="yellow">What about Yi In Jwa?
You haven't found him yet?</font>

121
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,990
<font color="yellow">He is long gone now.</font>

122
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,440
<font color="yellow">Even if he does manage to live...</font>

123
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,390
<font color="yellow">he won't be able to rise up again.</font>

124
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,410
<font color="yellow">Goodness, why are you pests
all hanging around here?</font>

125
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,980
<font color="yellow">Get out of here now!</font>

126
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,250
<font color="yellow">Deliver this to the shaman.</font>

127
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,160
<font color="yellow">My lord, you are still alive.</font>

128
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,750
<font color="yellow">Madam.</font>

129
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,960
<font color="yellow">A homeless man outside gave me this.</font>

130
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,120
<font color="yellow"><i>Do not look for me. Just wait.</i></font>

131
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,730
<font color="yellow"><i>I will come find you again, someday.</i></font>

132
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:14,490
<font color="yellow">There is no way to express
the grief for the late King.</font>

133
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,670
<font color="yellow">We must protect the people of this nation
and not leave the throne empty.</font>

134
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,770
<font color="yellow">For the strength and leadership of Joseon</font>

135
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,400
<font color="yellow">I declare Crown Prince Yi Geum
as the new king.</font>

136
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,340
<font color="yellow">Reign forever.</font>

137
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,470

138
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,480
<font color="yellow">Reign forever.</font>

139
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,830
<font color="yellow">Long live the king!</font>

140
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,670
<font color="yellow">Long live the king!</font>

141
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,860
<font color="yellow">Long live the king, long live the king!</font>

142
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,740
<font color="yellow">Long live the king!</font>

143
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,960
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you resent me?</i></font>

144
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,890
<font color="yellow"><i>I do not resent you.</i></font>

145
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,440
<font color="yellow"><i>We have our own destinies.</i></font>

different paths.</i></font>

147
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:01,270
<font color="yellow">Long live the king!</font>

148
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,330
<font color="yellow">Long live the king, long live the king!</font>

149
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,990
<font color="yellow">Long live the king!</font>

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,800
<font color="yellow">Long live the king!</font>

151

<font color="yellow"><i>Just you wait.</i></font>

152
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,960
<font color="yellow"><i>I will rise up again.</i></font>

153
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,110
<font color="yellow"><i>I will tear down this
corrupt government.</i></font>

154
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,170
<font color="yellow"><i>I will turn the government
upside down.</i></font>

<font color="yellow">This bitter fate with Yi In Jwa?</font>

308
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,680
<font color="yellow">Yi In Jwa.</font>

309
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,950
<font color="yellow">My lord, do you hear that?</font>

310
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,300
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

311
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,340
<font color="yellow">This is the will of the people.</font>

312
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,750
<font color="yellow"><i>King, wait for me.</i></font>

313
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,840
<font color="yellow"><i>I will step on Hanyang land soon.</i></font>

314
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,850
<font color="yellow"><i>Yi In Jwa is now an unavoidable force.</i></font>

315
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,450
<font color="yellow"><i>Every moment is critical.</i></font>

316
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,690
<font color="yellow">Now... it's time for you to meet him.</font>

317
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,110
<font color="yellow"><i>Your Majesty.</i></font>

318
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,030
<font color="yellow"><i>Former Special Military Officer,
Baek Dae Gil, is here.</i></font>

319
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,050
<font color="yellow">You may all leave now.</font>

320
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,800
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

321
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,660
<font color="yellow">Father, who is this person?</font>

322
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,040
<font color="yellow">Haeng, why don't you
step outside for a moment?</font>

323
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,150
<font color="yellow">I feel as though we have
a wide distance between us.</font>

324
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:29,040
<font color="yellow">You look so much like King Sukjong.</font>

325
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,750
<font color="yellow">Do I?</font>

326
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:36,970
<font color="yellow">I heard that people who aided the rebels
were massacred by the soldiers.</font>

327
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,540
<font color="yellow">Some people become rebels.</font>

328
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,580
<font color="yellow">Some people join hands with those rebels.</font>

329
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,020
<font color="yellow">And some people help them
from the background.</font>

330
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,570
<font color="yellow">They are rebels, just the same,
and have paid for their crimes.</font>

331
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,780
<font color="yellow">And why?</font>

332
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,810
<font color="yellow">Why did these people start
following those rebels?</font>

333
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,560
<font color="yellow">Did you not stop to think about that?</font>

334
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:06,450
<font color="yellow">All people want is a bit of land
they can farm.</font>

335
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,360
<font color="yellow"><i>A bit of grain and food to eat.</i></font>

336
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,810
<font color="yellow">That is all.</font>

337
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,830
<font color="yellow">That is all the people want,
Your Majesty.</font>

338
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,330
<font color="yellow">And so?</font>

339
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,740
<font color="yellow">The rebels are spreading out.</font>

340
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,020
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me I should
sit here and just watch?</font>

341
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,690
<font color="yellow">Your Majesty.</font>

342
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,360
<font color="yellow">Then what makes you any different
than the rebel Yi In Jwa?</font>

343
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,800
<font color="yellow">You did not come here to
receive my royal command.</font>

344
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,570
<font color="yellow">You came here to reproach me.</font>

345
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,890
<font color="yellow">Please think of the people first,
Your Majesty.</font>

346
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,110
<font color="yellow">It is a small sacrifice for
the good of the nation.</font>

347
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:50,530
<font color="yellow">I must endure and pay for killing my own
people because I sit in this throne.</font>

348
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,490
<font color="yellow">I will give you a government post
and military soldiers.</font>

349
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,520
<font color="yellow">No one knows Yi In Jwa better than you.</font>

350
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,950
<font color="yellow">You can read that animal's mind.</font>

351
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,290
<font color="yellow">I do not care what must be sacrificed.</font>

352
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,090
<font color="yellow">Stop him.</font>

353
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:14,010
<font color="yellow">If you use your army,
more people will get hurt.</font>

354
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,690
<font color="yellow">Please reconsider, Your Majesty.</font>

355
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,450
<font color="yellow">I will give you five days.</font>

356
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,680
<font color="yellow">If I do not hear from you in five days...</font>

357
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,780
<font color="yellow">I will use my army.</font>

358
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,110
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

359
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,050
<font color="yellow">If you care for the people...</font>

360
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,330
<font color="yellow">there is nothing you cannot do.</font>

361
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,260
<font color="yellow">What have you decided?</font>

362
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,780
<font color="yellow">They are all anxious too.</font>

363
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,550
<font color="yellow">The army will be arriving
in Hanyang in ten days.</font>

364
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,760
<font color="yellow">The government will be
in a similar state.</font>

365
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,850
<font color="yellow">We have no time.</font>

366
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,330
<font color="yellow">At first, they said it was
a disturbance in a small town.</font>

367
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,720
<font color="yellow">Now, it's one of the rural districts.</font>

368
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,450
<font color="yellow">Now the islands are involved,
and they're getting very close.</font>

369
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,930
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we do something immediately?</font>

370
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:34,580
<font color="yellow">Still, we should not act rashly.
<i>[Jo Il Soo]</i></font>

371
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:39,720
<font color="yellow">There is no guarantee that
Yi In Jwa will succeed.</font>

372
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,910
<font color="yellow">We could get beheaded at any moment.</font>

373
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:49,230
<font color="yellow">Also, the King summoned Baek Dae Gil.</font>

374
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:52,050
<font color="yellow">I don't know what he is thinking.</font>

375
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:58,220
<font color="yellow">I suppose he wants to use Baek Dae Gil
to catch Yi In Jwa one more time.</font>

376
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,370
<font color="yellow"><i>That will not happen.</i></font>

377
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,200
<font color="yellow">This is a letter from Yi In Jwa.</font>

378
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,210
<font color="yellow">Is everything in this letter true?</font>

379
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,520
<font color="yellow">Tell him this.</font>

380
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,950
<font color="yellow">The Soron faction will
side ourselves with Yi In Jwa.</font>

381
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,990
<font color="yellow">My lord!</font>

382
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,090
<font color="yellow">However, if this is not true...</font>

383
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,850
<font color="yellow">our entire faction will oppose him.</font>

384
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,530
<font color="yellow">Be very clear about that.</font>

385
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,850
<font color="yellow">I will deliver the message.</font>

386
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:14,990
<font color="yellow">My lord, what exactly
was in that letter?</font>

387
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,810
<font color="yellow">First.</font>

388
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:23,500
<font color="yellow">He will install Mil Poong Goon as king.</font>

389
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,340
<font color="yellow">"Pae Ga Yib Jin".</font>

390
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,390
<font color="yellow">I am going to dethrone the fake king
and install the real one.</font>

391
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,740
<font color="yellow"><i>[Mil Poong Goon, grandson of
Crown Prince Sohyeon]</i></font>

392
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,540
<font color="yellow">So I am the true king?</font>

393
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,580
<font color="yellow">The King poisoned the late King
and that's how he's now on the throne.</font>

394
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:46,380
<font color="yellow">He was born from a water maid,
so his royal lineage is questionable.</font>

395
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,530
<font color="yellow">How can we have a ruler like that?</font>

396
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:55,720
<font color="yellow">We need you to remove him
from the throne, Your Highness.</font>

397
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,620
<font color="yellow">You must sit on the throne.</font>

398
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,830
<font color="yellow">Build a new government.</font>

399
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:04,900
<font color="yellow">Pay the gratitude back to the people.</font>

400
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:08,850
<font color="yellow">Why don't you show me your strength?</font>

401
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:14,740
<font color="yellow">We do not need to go far, Your Highness.</font>

402
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,220
<font color="yellow">I'm from Jeolla-do.</font>

403
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,010
<font color="yellow">I'm from Chungcheong-do.</font>

404
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,520
<font color="yellow">I'm from Gyeongsang-do.</font>

405
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:43,050
<font color="yellow">Your Highness,
they are not the only ones.</font>

406
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:50,140
<font color="yellow">In all of the eight cities,
we have over 200,000 people.</font>

407
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,050
<font color="yellow">200,000...</font>

408
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,840
<font color="yellow">Do you really have an army of 200,000?</font>

409
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Highness.</font>

410
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,600
<font color="yellow"><i>We have Jeong Hee Ryang in Yeongnam</i></font>

411
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,010
<font color="yellow"><i>and Park Pil Hyun
in Honam training fighters.</i></font>

412
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,060
<font color="yellow"><i>We have men and women
helping out in all areas of operation.</i></font>

413
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,510
<font color="yellow">However, no matter
how many people there are</font>

414
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:40,260
<font color="yellow">do you think people who are not
trained can handle soldiers?</font>

415
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,120
<font color="yellow">Also, we do not have
any allies within the palace.</font>

416
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,550
<font color="yellow">It will not be so easy
to bring down the King.</font>

417
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:51,220
<font color="yellow">What if we do have an ally in the palace?</font>

418
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:56,060
<font color="yellow">The Soron faction have no power anymore.</font>

419
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,140
<font color="yellow">It's someone higher than that.</font>

420
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,090
<font color="yellow">Higher than that?</font>

421
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,900
<font color="yellow">The Queen Dowager.</font>

422
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,300
<font color="yellow"><i>The Queen Dowager?</i></font>

423
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:12,780
<font color="yellow">Are you really telling me that
she is working with Yi In Jwa?</font>

424
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,510
<font color="yellow">Watch what you say.</font>

425
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:24,660
<font color="yellow">I will speak to her myself
and confirm it.</font>

426
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,610
<font color="yellow">You should all prepare yourself.</font>

427
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,970
<font color="yellow">"The royal lineage has been broken".</font>

428
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,830
<font color="yellow">"It must be rectified".</font>

429
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:47,390
<font color="yellow">Did the Queen Dowager
really send this letter?</font>

430
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,080
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

431
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,210
<font color="yellow">The Queen Dowager gave it
to me herself in person.</font>

432
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:14,180
<font color="yellow">I cannot forget the night the late King
was poisoned and killed.</font>

433
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:18,940
<font color="yellow">My blood curdles
every time I see the King.</font>

434
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,580
<font color="yellow">Do you know how that feels?</font>

435
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,600
<font color="yellow">If you are able to move the hearts
of the people outside the palace...</font>

436
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,250
<font color="yellow">I will move the hearts of the ministers
and sway their opinion.</font>

437
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,450
<font color="yellow">If you can end this corrupt nation...</font>

438
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:42,480
<font color="yellow">I promise you that I will
end the King's life.</font>

439
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,390
<font color="yellow">Please, make your plan a success.</font>

440
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,170
<font color="yellow">The moment you decide to join me</font>

441
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:59,740
<font color="yellow">the Queen Dowager will draw her sword.</font>

442
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,960
<font color="yellow">Have you not seen enough?</font>

443
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,560
<font color="yellow">With the strength that we have</font>

444
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,300
<font color="yellow">it will take ten days
to reach the capital.</font>

445
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,600
<font color="yellow">Ten days is enough.</font>

446
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,600
<font color="yellow">Your Highness.</font>

447
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,970
<font color="yellow">Make your decision now.</font>

448
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,240
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

449
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,350
<font color="yellow">I will join your cause.</font>

450
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,590
<font color="yellow">There are many who have headed
north to take refuge there.</font>

451
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,020
<font color="yellow">Master, I'm going to go meet Hong Mae.</font>

452
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,170
<font color="yellow">You go back to the mountain
and get ready.</font>

453
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,770
<font color="yellow">All right, but wait a minute here...</font>

454
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:53,570
<font color="yellow">Who do you think are
to give orders to your master?</font>

455
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:59,120
<font color="yellow">Master, you're going to go regardless.
Why are you complaining?</font>

456
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,640
<font color="yellow">Why, that rude kid!</font>

457
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,390
<font color="yellow"><i>What?</i></font>

458
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:09,690
<font color="yellow">You want me to get
some medicine for you?</font>

459
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,130
<font color="yellow">Yes, right now.</font>

460
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,680
<font color="yellow">They say you can get
anything here in Hanyang.</font>

461
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,400
<font color="yellow">You show up here after years.
What is this nonsense?</font>

462
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,390
<font color="yellow">Look here, Hong Mae.</font>

463
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:26,320
<font color="yellow">You've made your living from
the blood and tears of the people.</font>

464
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,220
<font color="yellow">For once in your life, you can
do something on their behalf.</font>

465
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:33,530
<font color="yellow">There's no need to speak like that.
What blood and tears?</font>

466
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,430
<font color="yellow">It's not hard to get the medicine.</font>

467
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,760
<font color="yellow">How much do you need?</font>

468
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,820
<font color="yellow">Are you all ready?</font>

469
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,660
<font color="yellow">I have thirty horses prepared
and I have food for them too.</font>

470
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:01,560
<font color="yellow">This is from Hong Mae.
Seol Im, you take care of it.</font>

471
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,150
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's see.</font>

472
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,920
<font color="yellow">This is a peddler's guide map
for the eight cities.</font>

473
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,500
<font color="yellow">Dae Gil, South Goblin, and Seol Im.
You go here.</font>

474
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,110
<font color="yellow">Go to Anseong and block Yi In Jwa.</font>

475
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:23,250
<font color="yellow">The remaining three will go to Daejeon
and stop Yi In Jwa's people.</font>

476
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,750
<font color="yellow">Next, we'll each go to
Gyeongsang-do and Jeolla-do.</font>

477
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,140
<font color="yellow">We will go to the areas they control.</font>

478
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,530
<font color="yellow">We'll win over the people and take on
Jeong Hee Ryang and Park Pil Hyun.</font>

479
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,060
<font color="yellow">No, I'm going to Mokcheon.</font>

480
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,140
<font color="yellow">That's not a strategically
important city.</font>

481
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,540
<font color="yellow">That's why it's important.</font>

482
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,340
<font color="yellow">Things have gotten worse.</font>

483
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:06,430
<font color="yellow">Yi In Jwa has His Highness,
Mil Poong Goon, with him.</font>

484
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,360
<font color="yellow">Mil Poong Goon?</font>

485
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,560
<font color="yellow">Yi In Jwa is pretty smart.</font>

486
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,680
<font color="yellow">Isn't he going around lying?</font>

487
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,170
<font color="yellow">He's telling everyone he will
give them grain and land.</font>

488
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,840
<font color="yellow">Who wouldn't follow him?</font>

489
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,720
<font color="yellow">If I didn't know what he was like</font>

490
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,470
<font color="yellow">I would risk my life
to fight for him too.</font>

491
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,830
<font color="yellow">How are we supposed
to stop all those people?</font>

492
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,260
<font color="yellow">It's not just one or two people.</font>

493
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,010
<font color="yellow">It's 100,000 or 200,000 people.</font>

494
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,740
<font color="yellow">It's better to use a strong army.</font>

495
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,910
<font color="yellow">It's not possible unless you
can fight them all at once.</font>

496
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,240
<font color="yellow">It is possible.</font>

497
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,700
<font color="yellow">If we can just catch Yi In Jwa...</font>

498
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:55,140
<font color="yellow">The problem is that
we only have five days.</font>

499
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,550
<font color="yellow">I will give you five days.</font>

500
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,740
<font color="yellow">If I do not hear from you in five days...</font>

501
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,110
<font color="yellow">I will use my army.</font>

502
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,530
<font color="yellow">Once five days pass</font>

503
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:11,140
<font color="yellow">the Special Military and all
five branches of the military</font>

504
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,990
<font color="yellow">will be mobilized at once.</font>

505
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,220
<font color="yellow">If that happens...</font>

506
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,200
<font color="yellow">it's unavoidable that
the people's blood will be shed.</font>

507
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,750
<font color="yellow">I do not want even
one person to get hurt.</font>

508
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,880
<font color="yellow">Five days is long.</font>

509
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,160
<font color="yellow">I know the King promised you five days</font>

510
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,670
<font color="yellow">but he will not be sitting by
and not take action.</font>

511
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,900
<font color="yellow">Three days then.</font>

512
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,440
<font color="yellow">Our goal is to catch
Yi In Jwa in three days.</font>

513
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,910
<font color="yellow">Chief of the 5th Military Branch.</font>

514
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:13,830
<font color="yellow">From this point on, I am allowing
the use of guns and gunpowder.</font>

515
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,570
<font color="yellow">Hand out these guns to
the soldiers in your unit.</font>

516
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,390
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Majesty!</font>

517
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,140
<font color="yellow">How many men are in the Gyeonggi unit?</font>

518
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,010
<font color="yellow">There are one leader
and three special officers.</font>

519
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,900
<font color="yellow">There are 1,350.</font>

520
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:39,260
<font color="yellow">Choose 1,000 well-trained men
from them to create an elite troop.</font>

521
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,930
<font color="yellow">Wait for my orders.</font>

522
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:42,410
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Majesty!</font>

523
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:47,140
<font color="yellow">The men in the Soron districts and
at the four gates will be cut in half.</font>

524
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:52,740
<font color="yellow">Military trainers and the Forbidden Guard
Division will guard against the rebels.</font>

525
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,350
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Majesty.</font>

526
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,240
<font color="yellow"><i>Your Majesty.</i></font>

527
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:01,610
<font color="yellow">Baek Dae Gil is heading towards Mokcheon?</font>

528
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:03,010
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Majesty.</font>

529
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:06,760
<font color="yellow">I will head there as well.</font>

530
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,530
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

531
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,260
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's possible?</font>

532
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:19,530
<font color="yellow">Do you think it is possible to stop
Yi In Jwa without an army?</font>

533
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:22,350
<font color="yellow">He is traveling with an entire
operation of people helping him.</font>

534
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:25,000
<font color="yellow">He has over 200,000 people.</font>

535
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,380
<font color="yellow">However, I trust in Baek Dae Gil.</font>

536
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:34,300
<font color="yellow">Trust me.</font>

537
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:38,050
<font color="yellow">It's not for my sake,
but for your sake.</font>

538
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,240
<font color="yellow">That is my wish.</font>

539
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,740
<font color="yellow"><i>Baek Dae Gil.</i></font>

540
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:49,370
<font color="yellow"><i>I trust in you too.</i></font>

541
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,740
<font color="yellow"><i>However...</i></font>

542
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,600
<font color="yellow"><i>As a king that sits on this throne...</i></font>

543
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,440
<font color="yellow"><i>I cannot trust you.</i></font>

544
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,210
<font color="yellow"><i>It does not allow it.</i></font>

545
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,140
<font color="yellow"><i>[Mokcheon]
I cannot trust anything.</i></font>

546
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,530
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

547
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:14,530
<font color="yellow">I would like to meet Yi In Jwa.</font>

548
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:19,260
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

549
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,530
<font color="yellow">I heard that you plan on returning
the land you claimed back to the people.</font>

550
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:25,770
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

551
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,390
<font color="yellow">It is true.</font>

552
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,070
<font color="yellow">His Highness has allowed it as well.</font>

553
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:39,370
<font color="yellow">I am Mil Poong Goon.</font>

554
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,950
<font color="yellow">Your Highness!</font>

555
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:54,300
<font color="yellow">We, the citizens of Mokcheon,
promise to join Yi In Jwa.</font>

556
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,850
<font color="yellow">They say the will of the people
is the will of the gods.</font>

557
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:05,170
<font color="yellow">Unpack your belongings
and allow everyone to rest here.</font>

558
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:08,070
<font color="yellow">Feed the horses plenty of food.</font>

559
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:10,370
<font color="yellow">Does that mean...</font>

560
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:16,810
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow, we will cross over
Jukju Mountain Fortress.</font>

561
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,420
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

562
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,640
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

563
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:40,230
<font color="yellow">Feed them a lot, all right?</font>

564
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,510
<font color="yellow">Did you do what I ordered?</font>

565
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, and you have a visitor.</font>

566
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,420
<font color="yellow">My lord.</font>

567
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:04,310
<font color="yellow">What brings you all the way out here?</font>

568
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,270
<font color="yellow">Baek Dae Gil.</font>

569
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, the King has summoned Baek Dae Gil.</font>

570
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,870
<font color="yellow">What? Him again?</font>

571
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,050
<font color="yellow">Baek Dae Gil...</font>

572
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,620
<font color="yellow">Yi In Jwa!</font>

573
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,070
<font color="yellow">Hide like a rat
and live this way forever!</font>

574
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,120
<font color="yellow">Do not show that face of yours again.</font>

575
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,750
<font color="yellow">Did you deliver my message
to the Soron ministers?</font>

576
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,240
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

577
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,740
<font color="yellow">However, the situation in
the palace is very intense.</font>

578
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:02,450
<font color="yellow"><i>The King will make his move soon.</i></font>

579
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:11,350
<font color="yellow">The King will use the central army
just to stop me.</font>

580
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,240
<font color="yellow">You should get to Hanyang quickly.</font>

581
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,480
<font color="yellow">Keep an eye on the palace.</font>

582
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:27,750
<font color="yellow">Baek Dae Gil.</font>

583
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:32,470
<font color="yellow">It will cause problems for us
if he makes a move.</font>

584
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,350
<font color="yellow">That's what fate is.</font>

585
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:39,910
<font color="yellow">A destiny that you cannot
escape even if you try.</font>

586
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:46,830
<font color="yellow">If we meet again, either I will die
or Baek Dae Gill will die.</font>

587
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:49,870
<font color="yellow">It's one or the other.</font>

588
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:56,190
<font color="yellow">Where are you, Baek Dae Gil?</font>

589
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,690
<font color="yellow">He's planning on returning fully
out in the open like this.</font>

590
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:07,260
<font color="yellow">They are all being fooled by
that beast's two faces.</font>

591
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:12,960
<font color="yellow">I'm going to show everyone what
kind of person Yi In Jwa really is.</font>

592
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,750
<font color="yellow">Everyone should be okay, right?</font>

593
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,080
<font color="yellow"><i>[Jeonju Fortress]</i></font>

594
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:54,290
<font color="yellow"><i>Father and Master are more
trustworthy than anyone I know.</i></font>

595
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:01,030
<font color="yellow"><i>[Sangju Fortress]</i></font>

596
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:11,200
<font color="yellow">Who is Yi In Jwa, you ask?</font>

597
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,180
<font color="yellow">I will tell you about this guy.</font>

598
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,960
<font color="yellow"><i>Hong Mae and Yeon Hwa too.</i></font>

599
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,520
<font color="yellow">"Bad rumors regarding Yi In Jwa
have started to spread in Hanyang".</font>

600
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,600
<font color="yellow">Hong Mae's mouth is
still alive and well.</font>

601
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:00,740
<font color="yellow">Are you all ready now?</font>

602
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,040
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

603
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:04,360
<font color="yellow">We must succeed.</font>

604
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,120
<font color="yellow">If we fail today...</font>

605
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,200
<font color="yellow">The Special Military is on
standby outside the city.</font>

606
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,530
<font color="yellow"><i>the army will make their move.</i></font>

607
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,960
<font color="yellow">I have said this before.</font>

608
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,770
<font color="yellow">This group has gathered very quickly,
so they do not know one another well.</font>

609
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:27,830
<font color="yellow">We must use that against them.</font>

610
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:30,710
<font color="yellow">- Do you understand?
- Yes.</font>

611
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,610
<font color="yellow">Oh my...</font>

612
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:42,320
<font color="yellow">I was tired, so had a good nap.
Now I feel better.</font>

613
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,770
<font color="yellow">You both must be tired. Go in and rest.</font>

614
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,530
<font color="yellow">We'll watch this place for now.</font>

615
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,280
<font color="yellow">Should we?</font>

616
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,850
<font color="yellow">Then, thank you.</font>

617
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:56,250
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

618
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:18,400
<font color="yellow">You make this much stew?</font>

619
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:20,870
<font color="yellow">How can they eat all of this?</font>

620
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,100
<font color="yellow">Look how many people there are.</font>

621
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,700
<font color="yellow">You have to make this much
in order for them to eat enough.</font>

622
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,270
<font color="yellow">This is from Hong Mae.</font>

623
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,580
<font color="yellow">I'll have one more bowl of rice.</font>

624
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,210
<font color="yellow">Yes, have some more. It's good.</font>

625
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:52,880
<font color="yellow">Have enough so that you get full.</font>

626
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:06,120
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

627
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,030
<font color="yellow">Oh, my stomach!</font>

628
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:34,530
<font color="yellow">We will cross over Anseong, gather
strength, and go into the capital city.</font>

629
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:37,490
<font color="yellow">Are you all ready?</font>

630
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:39,590
<font color="yellow">- Yes!
- My lord!</font>

631
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:44,060
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- We have a big problem.</font>

632
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:48,100
<font color="yellow">The men have eaten something wrong.
They all have diarrhea.</font>

633
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,300
<font color="yellow">Sir, the storehouse is on fire.</font>

634
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:08,050
<font color="yellow">Hurry, hurry!</font>

635
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,850
<font color="yellow">Water, water, water!</font>

636
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:13,930
<font color="yellow">Bring more!</font>

637
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:20,800
<font color="yellow">Sir, the horses are all gone.</font>

638
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,180
<font color="yellow">Why weren't the horses
being looked after?</font>

639
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:29,690
<font color="yellow">A sudden stomach issue,
no provisions, and now the horses.</font>

640
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:36,900
<font color="yellow"><i>There's a rat hiding in our midst.</i></font>

641
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,590
<font color="yellow">Do you think Dae Gil will be okay?</font>

642
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:51,350
<font color="yellow">Do you know what the most
useless thing to worry about is?</font>

643
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,310
<font color="yellow">It's worrying about Dae Gil.</font>

644
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,090
<font color="yellow">He has lied to the people.</font>

645
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:06,090
<font color="yellow">As for Yi In Jwa and his followers
who have insulted this government...</font>

646
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,060
<font color="yellow">slaughter them all.</font>

647
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,220
<font color="yellow">Yes, Your Majesty!</font>

648
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:31,120
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time, Yi In Jwa.</font>

649
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:33,910
<font color="yellow">Baek Dae Gil!</font>
