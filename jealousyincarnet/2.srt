- Yes, Sir.</font>

00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,920
<font color="yellow">I'll turn it off.</font>

38
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,380
<font color="yellow">- Have a good time.
- Edit it again.</font>

39

<font color="yellow">Director approved it.</font>

40
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,220
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

41
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,950
<font color="yellow">It was President's order.</font>

42
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,690
<font color="yellow">Don't use him as an excuse.</font>

43
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,320
<font color="yellow">Because the first teaser was too boring,</font>

44
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,020
<font color="yellow">President ordered the second one to be funny.</font>

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,690
<font color="yellow">So I even danced for the sake of the station.</font>

46
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,550
<font color="yellow">Lee Hwa Shin is young,</font>

47
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,180
<font color="yellow">- incompetent and immature.
- All right.</font>

48
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,280
<font color="yellow">Why does he appear first?</font>

49
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,380
<font color="yellow">He lacks humanity.</font>

50
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,750
<font color="yellow">I'm scared there will be another reporter like him.</font>

51
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,420
<font color="yellow">Do you favour him because you're from the same university?</font>

52
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,350
<font color="yellow">Is he treating you to golf rounds and girls in Bangkok,</font>

53
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,180
<font color="yellow">providing you with flight tickets and hotel rooms?</font>

54
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,220
<font color="yellow">You used to be married to his brother.</font>

55
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,850
<font color="yellow">You know that.</font>

56
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,980
<font color="yellow">Is that why you put us together...</font>

57
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,280
<font color="yellow">at the end of that video?</font>

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,550
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to start and end the video with him?</font>

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,250
<font color="yellow">Cut him out.</font>

60
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,450
<font color="yellow">Let me appear first.</font>

61
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,420
<font color="yellow">- Also, - It has already been aired.</font>

62
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,180
<font color="yellow">the flower of the station is reporters.</font>

63
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,650
<font color="yellow">Especially, pretty female reporters.</font>

64
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,180
<font color="yellow">They're the flower.</font>

65
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,250
<font color="yellow">You don't even have to recruit announcers.</font>

66
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,620
<font color="yellow">If you recruit pretty and smart female reporters,</font>

67
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,020
<font color="yellow">they can read the news themselves.</font>

68
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,650
<font color="yellow">We don't need any announcers.</font>

69
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,080
<font color="yellow">The news will sound more trustworthy.</font>

70
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,620
<font color="yellow">You'll be killing two birds with one stone.</font>

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,320
<font color="yellow">Make the most of them.</font>

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,380
<font color="yellow">The example is...</font>

73
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,120
<font color="yellow">standing right here.</font>

74
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,450
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

75
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,850
<font color="yellow">not just a parrot that reads off the prompter.</font>

76
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,520
<font color="yellow">I convey the liveliness, tension, conflicts and details...</font>

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,420
<font color="yellow">of the scene through news.</font>

78
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,750
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

79
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,380
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin must have gotten so much massage in Bangkok.</font>

80
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,780
<font color="yellow">His face is getting greasier and greasier.</font>

81
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,450
<font color="yellow">Does he really deserve to appear first in the video?</font>

82
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,950
<font color="yellow">Cut him out.</font>

83
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,950
<font color="yellow">Cut her out, too.</font>

84
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,320
<font color="yellow">Show me, the producer, the cameraman and...</font>

85
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,120
<font color="yellow">There's one missing.</font>

86
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,820
<font color="yellow">Find the best-looking male reporter.</font>

87
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,250
<font color="yellow">Make a new video.</font>

88
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,880
<font color="yellow">Mr Choi, book the editing room.</font>

89
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,920
<font color="yellow">- Are you done?
- I'm not done yet.</font>

90
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,950
<font color="yellow">Did you forget to suggest that we shouldn't recruit announcers?</font>

91
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,450
<font color="yellow">You gave me the thumbs up.</font>

92
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,950
<font color="yellow">- When?
- At our team dinner.</font>

93
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,520
<font color="yellow">You said it'd be economical and reasonable.</font>

94
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,250
<font color="yellow">You even gave me a high five.</font>

95
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,850
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

96
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,380
<font color="yellow">Do you know what people say about your midnight news?</font>

97
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,850
<font color="yellow">They're afraid you'll burst through the TV.</font>

98
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,990
<font color="yellow">Haven't you read any comments about your arrogant attitude?</font>

99
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,150
<font color="yellow">They need to go to bed after watching the midnight news.</font>

100
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,350
<font color="yellow">They change the channel because you look so scary.</font>

101
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,450
<font color="yellow">You keep track of the viewer rating all the time.</font>

102
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,320
<font color="yellow">Why don't you take a look at your own face?</font>

103
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,780
<font color="yellow">Stop glaring at the camera.</font>

104
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,920
<font color="yellow">Let's face it.</font>

105
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,680
<font color="yellow">After the recruitment advert last year,</font>

106
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,820
<font color="yellow">do you know how many applied for the announcer position?</font>

107
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,750
<font color="yellow">3,000 applied. There will be more this year.</font>

108
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,120
<font color="yellow">Announcers are the flower of the station.</font>

109
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,750
<font color="yellow">Reading news is not their only job.</font>

110
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,750
<font color="yellow">You don't understand how broad the scope of the announcer is.</font>

111
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,880
<font color="yellow">- Should they be temporary?
- What?</font>

112
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,950
<font color="yellow">Their contract should be temporary like weather forecasters'.</font>

113
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,980
<font color="yellow">Existing announcers can't wait to be freelancers.</font>

114
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,050
<font color="yellow">We could hire freelancers instead of educating new ones.</font>

115
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,150
<font color="yellow">How much do we pay 100 announcers every month?</font>

116
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,720
<font color="yellow">How are we going to afford that?</font>

117
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,920
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

118
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,820
<font color="yellow">It's not your money.</font>

119
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,020
<font color="yellow">We're not recruiting any announcer this year.</font>

121
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,920
<font color="yellow">I'll be at the final interview.</font>

122
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,480
<font color="yellow">I'll be at the final interview for reporters, too.</font>

123
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,180
<font color="yellow">I'm going to recruit tons of female reporters.</font>

124
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,880
<font color="yellow">Only ugly ones. Be prepared.</font>

125
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,720
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

126
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,820
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mr Choi.</font>

127
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,750
<font color="yellow">Why are you here so early?</font>

128
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,520
<font color="yellow">I was done with everything.</font>

129
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,480
<font color="yellow">I couldn't wait to work.</font>

130
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,750
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

131
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,120
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

132
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,450
<font color="yellow">Don't go in there now. The atmosphere is terrible.</font>

133
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,320
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

134
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,680
<font color="yellow">It's because of you.</font>

135
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,450
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

136
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,220
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be around here for the time being. Leave.</font>

137
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,720
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you listen to me?</font>

138
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,150
<font color="yellow">- Leave.
- Let me just say hi.</font>

139
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,180
<font color="yellow">Just go.</font>

140
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,980
<font color="yellow">- I just want to say hi.
- Just go.</font>

141
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,720
<font color="yellow">They should know I'm back. Let go of me.</font>

142
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,680
<font color="yellow">- Don't go there. They'll slap you.
- Let go of me.</font>

143
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,050
<font color="yellow">Can they make us temporary employees?</font>

144
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,420
<font color="yellow">Does Ms Gye have something against announcers?</font>

145
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,420
<font color="yellow">I'll tell my father...</font>

146
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,420
<font color="yellow">to send Ms Gye to another station or something.</font>

147
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,250
<font color="yellow">He should focus on the government affairs.</font>

148
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,850
<font color="yellow">I can ask my grandfather to stop sponsoring...</font>

149
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,350
<font color="yellow">Ms Gye's news.</font>

150
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,950
<font color="yellow">Stop sponsoring?</font>

151
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,950
<font color="yellow">That's not right.</font>

152
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,320
<font color="yellow">We need sponsors no matter what.</font>

153
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,180
<font color="yellow">Then what should we do?</font>

154
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,850
<font color="yellow">We should fight on our own.</font>

155
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,750
<font color="yellow">We should prove that the station needs announcers.</font>

156
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,250

<font color="yellow">Just.</font>

774
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,380
<font color="yellow">I have to go on air. Goodness.</font>

775
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:45,850
<font color="yellow">I just thought of you.</font>

776
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,780
<font color="yellow">I'm so hot.</font>

777
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,050
<font color="yellow">Our CEO...</font>

778
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,480
<font color="yellow">brought it himself.</font>

779
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,480
<font color="yellow">The CEO?</font>

780
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:22,150
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

781
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,780
<font color="yellow">Mr Ko?</font>

782
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,950
<font color="yellow">Mr Ko? He was just here.</font>

783
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:29,880
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

784
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,180
<font color="yellow">Na Ri! Na Ri!</font>

785
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,850
<font color="yellow">Where's the outfit?</font>

786
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,880
<font color="yellow">There aren't any.</font>

787
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,920
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Oh no.</font>

788
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,580
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

789
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:49,850

792
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,020
<font color="yellow">Am I supposed to go on naked?</font>

793
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,350
<font color="yellow">You have an hour.</font>

794
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:00,050
<font color="yellow">You reek of alcohol.</font>

795
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,680
<font color="yellow">Na Ri! Na Ri! This way!</font>

796
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,120

797
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,250
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

798
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,020
<font color="yellow">- Why you...
- I'm sorry I'm late.</font>

799
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,050
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- I smell alcohol.</font>

800
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,550
<font color="yellow">- Were you drinking?
- I was not.</font>

801
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,450
<font color="yellow">- Get in position.
- I'm sorry.</font>

802
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,180
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I'm late.</font>

803
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,650

804
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,380

805
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,980

806
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,050
<font color="yellow">Let's take out the weather.</font>

807
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:34,480
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean?
- We should take it out.</font>

808
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,920
<font color="yellow">We can't air like this.</font>

809
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:38,250
<font color="yellow">What are they doing?</font>

810
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,650
<font color="yellow">- Are you drunk?
- Excuse me? Me?</font>

811
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,650
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I didn't drink.</font>

812
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,380
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

813
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:47,850
<font color="yellow">I never missed a day other than weekends...</font>

814
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:50,180
<font color="yellow">for 4 years. This is my 1,029th broadcast.</font>

815
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,350
<font color="yellow">I can do it with my eyes closed.</font>

816
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,250
<font color="yellow">I can do it. I can.</font>

817
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,980
<font color="yellow">- No.
- We're starting weather now.</font>

818
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,550
<font color="yellow">Get out. You're fired.</font>

819
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,550
<font color="yellow">- Mr Oh!
- Get out.</font>

820
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:06,750
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean, fired?
- Stand by.</font>

821
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,120
<font color="yellow">Stand by!</font>

822
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:13,780
<font color="yellow">Five, four, three, two, one.</font>

823
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,780
<font color="yellow">Cue!</font>

824
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:22,120
<font color="yellow">What's this? Hurry.</font>

825
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,550
<font color="yellow">- Mr Oh.
- You'd better not mess up.</font>

826
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,050
<font color="yellow">- Darn it.
- I can do it!</font>

827
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,950
<font color="yellow">Cue!</font>

828
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,350
<font color="yellow">The heat finally broke just before the weekend.</font>

829
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:39,380
<font color="yellow">Some parts of the south were in the 30s, so it was hot,</font>

830
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:43,350
<font color="yellow">but the temperature will come down over the weekend and we expect...</font>

831
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,050
<font color="yellow">sunny skies. Perfect for outings.</font>

832
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:49,580
<font color="yellow">However, the central region is expecting showers like today,</font>

833
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,980
<font color="yellow">so don't forget your umbrellas.</font>

834
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,580
<font color="yellow">I got cursed out today because of the sudden shower.</font>

835
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:00,950
<font color="yellow">The hot temperature seems to remain, but the heat wave has passed us.</font>

836
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,150
<font color="yellow">Autumn is approaching.</font>

837
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:06,320
<font color="yellow">We expect clear skies and the air dust level is down,</font>

838
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,980
<font color="yellow">so it should be clearer than usual.</font>

839
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,950
<font color="yellow">We expect a nice, cool breeze as well.</font>

840
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,450
<font color="yellow">The capital and Chungcheong region will get cloudy...</font>

841
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:19,580
<font color="yellow">and expects to get light drizzles in the evening.</font>

842
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:22,350
<font color="yellow">The expected low high in Seoul is 27 degrees.</font>

843
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:26,680
<font color="yellow">The same is expected for Gangneung.</font>

844
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,850
<font color="yellow">Gwangju will be hotter, reaching 30 degrees.</font>

845
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,750
<font color="yellow">The south region is expecting blue skies.</font>

846
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,650
<font color="yellow">You should be able to see the stars at night.</font>

847
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,550
<font color="yellow">You should be careful not to catch cold at a weather like this.</font>

848
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,750
<font color="yellow">We expect autumn rain starting next week.</font>

849
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,050
<font color="yellow">That was the weather.</font>

850
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:56,050
<font color="yellow">Cut.</font>

851
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:01,050
<font color="yellow">This will conclude the SBC 7 o'clock news.</font>

852
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,720

854
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,950
<font color="yellow">Get out. You're fired.</font>

855
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,650
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

856
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,350

<font color="yellow">Did I do well?</font>

866
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,020
<font color="yellow">It was the best. As long as you got the weather right.</font>

867
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:53,450
<font color="yellow">Why do I feel like I didn't do a good job?</font>
