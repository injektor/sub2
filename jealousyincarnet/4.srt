00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,640
<font color="yellow">You're acting more like yourself, Red.</font>

155
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,360
<font color="yellow">I feel much better to see that
you have your appetite back.</font>

156
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,110
<font color="yellow">I think my dad is going
to get better soon.</font>

157
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,120
<font color="yellow">His face looks so much more relaxed.</font>

158
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,240
<font color="yellow">Yeah, we thought so too.</font>

159
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,180
<font color="yellow">- Right, Chi Yeol?
- Yeah.</font>

160
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,840
<font color="yellow">Chi Yeol, clean this up.</font>

161
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,230
<font color="yellow">Nice rhymes.</font>

162
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,910
<font color="yellow">I'm so full!</font>

163
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,600
<font color="yellow">- Go home and sleep.
- No.</font>

164
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,020
<font color="yellow">You think she'd want to go home
to a dark place alone?</font>

165
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,360
<font color="yellow">You should lie down too.</font>

166
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,910
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going?
- Pillow.</font>

167
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,190
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

168
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,560
<font color="yellow">It's not warm out anymore.
You'll catch a cold.</font>

169
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,410
<font color="yellow">Doctor!</font>

170
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,170
<font color="yellow">How can I share a room with a man?</font>

171
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,110
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't do this if there were
empty beds in any other department.</font>

172
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,550
<font color="yellow">He's just a patient, not a man.</font>

173
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,680
<font color="yellow">What man? He's a patient.</font>

174
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,510
<font color="yellow">How is he not a man?
Why are you doing this to me?</font>

175
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,360
<font color="yellow">A male patient is man. A man is a man.</font>

176
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,650
<font color="yellow">If a man is not a man,
then what is he?</font>

177
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,740
<font color="yellow">What is this, anyway?
It's like a prison.</font>

178
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,740
<font color="yellow">This is seriously like
a prison or something.</font>

179
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,630
<font color="yellow">The nurse says there are no rooms,
so I want to be discharged.</font>

180
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,070
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

181
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,410
<font color="yellow">But I heard you worked together,
so I thought you'd be okay with him.</font>

182
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,070
<font color="yellow">You could tell me that all the men
in the world are just patients</font>

183
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,730
<font color="yellow">but he will always be a man to me.</font>

184
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,720
<font color="yellow">When I first started work, he was
the only one I thought of as a man.</font>

185
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,340
<font color="yellow">I never thought of anyone else as a man.</font>

186
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,360
<font color="yellow">- Is he your boyfriend?
- What?</font>

187
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,010
<font color="yellow">We didn't know you liked him.</font>

188
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,940
<font color="yellow">He's not my boyfriend!</font>

189
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,470
<font color="yellow">I don't like him... anymore.</font>

190
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,640
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

191
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,540
<font color="yellow">I will leave.</font>

192
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,320
<font color="yellow">You can book me in for another time.</font>

193
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,190
<font color="yellow">It won't be for a long time.</font>

194
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,420
<font color="yellow">- At worst, I'll just die.
- What?</font>

195
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,070
<font color="yellow">You've never even
dated a man, have you?</font>

196
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,490
<font color="yellow">I'm the only person
you've thought of as a man?</font>

197
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:55,530
<font color="yellow">I said so already earlier,
but I don't like you anymore.</font>

198
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,530
<font color="yellow">I don't care if I get dumped.</font>

199
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,980
<font color="yellow">I'm going to meet someone better than you
and have a passionate relationship.</font>

200
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,630
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I told you that.</font>

201
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,710
<font color="yellow">Why would you say you
don't care if you get dumped?</font>

202
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,280
<font color="yellow">Why are you even here when you're a guy?</font>

203
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,750
<font color="yellow">Isn't this what you wanted?</font>

204
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,800
<font color="yellow">Do you have breast cancer too?</font>

205
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,470
<font color="yellow">I have breast cancer.</font>

206
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,210
<font color="yellow">I don't have it...</font>

207
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,030
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

208
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,640
<font color="yellow">You're a woman and you don't have it.</font>

209
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,380
<font color="yellow">I'm a man and I have breast cancer?</font>

210
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,110
<font color="yellow">Is that true? You have breast...</font>

211
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,530
<font color="yellow">I only wanted you to get it checked out.</font>

212
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,340
<font color="yellow">I didn't think it'd
actually be breast cancer.</font>

213
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,760
<font color="yellow">Even if there's a lump there</font>

214
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,950
<font color="yellow">it usually turns out to be
benign and not cancer.</font>

215
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,750
<font color="yellow">I must be getting punished.</font>

216
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,070
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

217
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,540
<font color="yellow">How could this happen to you?</font>

218
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,910
<font color="yellow">Do you have to get chemotherapy?</font>

219
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,300
<font color="yellow">You're not in the late stages, right?
It's in the early stage?</font>

220
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,730
<font color="yellow">It is, right?</font>

221
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,900
<font color="yellow">Why are you alone?</font>

222
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,680
<font color="yellow">Are you really here alone?</font>

223
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,090
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? It's cancer!</font>

224
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,740
<font color="yellow">When is your guardian coming?</font>

225
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:26,170
<font color="yellow">When is your family coming?
You don't have family, Reporter?</font>

226
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,680
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

227
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,990
<font color="yellow">How could a macho guy like you get
breast cancer and not something else?</font>

228
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,060
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

229
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,420
<font color="yellow">Could it possibly be an error?</font>

230
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,230
<font color="yellow">Do men really get breast cancer?</font>

231
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,420
<font color="yellow">Can you please shut up?</font>

232
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,570
<font color="yellow">You have no idea how I feel.</font>

233
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,530
<font color="yellow">The day the station finds out</font>

234
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,720
<font color="yellow">being an anchor and
auditioning are over for me.</font>

235
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,580
<font color="yellow">My competitors will tear me apart as if
they were waiting for it to happen.</font>

236
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,140
<font color="yellow">They will make me out to be
some strange reporter.</font>

237
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,520
<font color="yellow">The 9:00 p.m. news anchor
with breast cancer.</font>

238
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,360
<font color="yellow">I don't want to the main topic
of some gossip papers.</font>

239
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,140
<font color="yellow">Once it becomes known,
my career as a reporter is over.</font>

240
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,040
<font color="yellow">I can't tell my family.</font>

241
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,870
<font color="yellow">You just need to
keep quiet about it, okay?</font>

242
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,040
<font color="yellow">Reporter, aren't you scared?</font>

243
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,610
<font color="yellow">You're dead meat if anyone finds out.</font>

244
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,640
<font color="yellow">I won't ever tell a soul.</font>

245
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,470
<font color="yellow">I won't tell even if I get paid
100 million won.</font>

246
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,260
<font color="yellow">Reporter, be strong.</font>

247
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,680
<font color="yellow">You should tell someone if they
offer you 100 million won.</font>

248
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,830
<font color="yellow">When will you ever make 100 million won?</font>

249
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,240
<font color="yellow">The surgery will go well.</font>

250
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,140
<font color="yellow">Go to sleep.</font>

251
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,280
<font color="yellow">Our doctor is the best
when it comes to breast cancer.</font>

252
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,590
<font color="yellow">Let's just sleep.</font>

253
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,790
<font color="yellow">Yeah, we need sleep
to do well in surgery.</font>

254
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,680
<font color="yellow">Okay, sleep.</font>

255
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,360
<font color="yellow">Let's go to sleep.</font>

256
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,590
<font color="yellow">Your surgery will go well.</font>

257
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,750
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

258
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,500
<font color="yellow">I will have a good night too.</font>

260
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,930
<font color="yellow">He's a chef?</font>

261
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,940
<font color="yellow">Chef, chef, chef, chef...</font>

262
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,280
<font color="yellow">He's a chef?</font>

263
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,020
<font color="yellow">Yes, saffron.</font>

264
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,610
<font color="yellow">They sprayed on too much perfume.</font>

265
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,030
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

266
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,720
<font color="yellow">I feel like this happened
because of what I said.</font>

267
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,530
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

268
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,700
<font color="yellow">Don't look at me like you're
looking at a cancer patient.</font>

269
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,750
<font color="yellow">I thought you were asleep.</font>

270
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,270
<font color="yellow">You... don't see me
as man anymore, do you?</font>

271
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,130
<font color="yellow">No, don't worry.</font>

272
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,780
<font color="yellow">I don't see you as a man.</font>

273
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,550
<font color="yellow">You're just a patient.</font>

274
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,820
<font color="yellow">Will I be able to wake up
from the anesthesia tomorrow?</font>

275
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,490
<font color="yellow">Will I be able to get married?</font>

276
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,610
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

277
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:45,540
<font color="yellow">Women wouldn't see a man
with breast cancer as manly.</font>

278
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,490
<font color="yellow">As long as I keep quiet about it,
no one will know.</font>

279
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,180
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't tell the woman you marry,
even on your first night after together.</font>

280
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:57,830
<font color="yellow">It's not sexy or anything just because
a man reveals all his secrets.</font>

281
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,860
<font color="yellow">It's not helpful at all.</font>

282
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,260
<font color="yellow">Can you lie about that?</font>

283
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,200
<font color="yellow">I ought to tell the truth to the person
who is going to be my wife.</font>

284
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,480
<font color="yellow">You think so?</font>

285
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,430
<font color="yellow">You had a one-sided crush on me
for three years.</font>

286
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,360
<font color="yellow">After finding out about this,
even you don't see me as a man.</font>

287
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,530
<font color="yellow">So, what kind of woman would?</font>

288
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,220
<font color="yellow">Stop thinking bad thoughts and go to bed.</font>

289
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,560
<font color="yellow">Would you be able to sleep
if you were me?</font>

290
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,010
<font color="yellow">They won't know for certain if it's
stage one or two until they cut me open.</font>

291
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,040
<font color="yellow">Will I need chemotherapy or not?</font>

292
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,050
<font color="yellow">Has the lymph node changed or not?
They won't know for sure.</font>

293
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,770
<font color="yellow">If it has, then they have to
remove this entire breast.</font>

294
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,700
<font color="yellow">You only have to
remove a little, is that it?</font>

295
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,830
<font color="yellow">Your breast will get a little smaller.
That's it, right?</font>

296
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,590
<font color="yellow">It's not cancer, right?</font>

297
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,300
<font color="yellow">Can I kiss you?</font>

298
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,360
<font color="yellow">See, it's not working.</font>

299
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,870
<font color="yellow">You don't even see me as a man anymore.</font>

300
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,670

and woman in a room together.</font>

303
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,150
<font color="yellow">There are beds in here and
you don't even want to kiss me?</font>

304
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,560

305
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,320
<font color="yellow">Do it.</font>

306
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,770
<font color="yellow">I want to.</font>

307
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,620

308
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,850
<font color="yellow">Yes, really.</font>

309
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,460
<font color="yellow">You really want to?</font>

310
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,250
<font color="yellow">I can't do it.</font>

311
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,780
<font color="yellow">I was just asking to see.</font>

312
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,850
<font color="yellow">I only needed to hear your answer.</font>

313
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,830
<font color="yellow">I feel like a woman now that
I'm a patient with breast cancer.</font>

314
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:34,550
<font color="yellow">I wanted to confirm if I'm still
a man who is sexy and can kiss.</font>

315
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,470
<font color="yellow">I just needed to hear
that answer so that...</font>

316
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,090
<font color="yellow">But you did want to kiss me, right?</font>

317
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,810
<font color="yellow">I'm still sexy. That's enough for me.</font>

318
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,950

326
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,010

327
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,260

333
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,220

It wasn't self-defense.</font>

but it was for over three years.</font>

383
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,750
<font color="yellow">I think it's crazy to end it
without even holding your hand.</font>

384
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:30,010
<font color="yellow">I haven't been able to end it because
I haven't done anything with you.</font>

<font color="yellow">I don't have any regrets anymore.</font>

387
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,700

with a woman's heart like that.</font>

388
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,900

- Yes.</font>

for you back there.</font>

390

<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

391
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,340

00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,410
<font color="yellow">Suppose I happen to marry a girl
that my mother chooses for me.</font>

451
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,320
<font color="yellow">Why am I acting like this?</font>

452
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:50,070
<font color="yellow">I just want to see
that girl in this one time.</font>

453
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:55,080
<font color="yellow">Then I want to decide if it's cheating,
compassion, sympathy, or just nosiness.</font>

454
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,310
<font color="yellow">Can't I just figure out
how I really feel?</font>

455
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,040
<font color="yellow">I was just throwing out the question.
You don't need to answer.</font>

456
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:09,100
<font color="yellow">When he's being this honest,
I can't go tattle on him.</font>

457
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,160
<font color="yellow">Patient, please wake up.</font>

458
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,090
<font color="yellow">Reporter. Reporter!</font>

459
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:23,330
<font color="yellow">I've lost all attachment for you.</font>

460
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,120
<font color="yellow">Patient, are you awake?</font>

461
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:29,150
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

462
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,930
<font color="yellow">Your surgery is over.
You've made it through the hard part.</font>

463
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,470
<font color="yellow">We'll move you into your room.</font>

464
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,400
<font color="yellow">How did it go? Did it spread?</font>

465
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,160
<font color="yellow">Do I need chemotherapy?</font>

466
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,500
<font color="yellow">The doctor will tell you the details
once we move you back to your room.</font>

467
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,030
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's over.</font>

468
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,120
<font color="yellow">The doctor will talk to me.</font>

469
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,460
<font color="yellow">You can have water in four hours.
We're going to take your blood pressure.</font>

470
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,920
<font color="yellow">We'll give you some painkillers,
so one moment.</font>

471
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,780
<font color="yellow">You will be in pain today once your
anesthesia starts to wear off.</font>

472
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:05,100
<font color="yellow">If you press on this when you're in pain,
you will get more painkillers.</font>

473
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,590
<font color="yellow">Don't hold it in when it hurts.
Just press it.</font>

474
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,860
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

475
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,590
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this girl!</font>

476
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:32,520
<font color="yellow">You'll have no one doing it at this rate.</font>

477
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,420
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so stupid?</font>

478
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,850
<font color="yellow">Thank you. You're really helpful.</font>

479
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,980
<font color="yellow">So, who is doing tonight's
7 p.m. weather?</font>

480
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,300
<font color="yellow">Are they going to tell me to do
the 7 p.m. weather live too?</font>

481
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,790
<font color="yellow"><i>You have the 9 p.m. golden time.</i></font>

482
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,370
<font color="yellow">Your greed knows no end.</font>

483
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:56,910
<font color="yellow">Do the viewers have to watch you
consecutively at 7 and 9 p.m.?</font>

484
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:01,300
<font color="yellow">I'm only saying this because
there isn't much time left.</font>

485
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,770
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri is gone now, so how come
they aren't assigning anyone new?</font>

486
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,520
<font color="yellow">They wouldn't be scouting
anyone new, would they?</font>

487
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,870
<font color="yellow">In that time?</font>

488
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,400
<font color="yellow">Maybe they're not doing weather.</font>

489
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,100
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't they do weather!</font>

490
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,770
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

491
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,010
<font color="yellow">Sit.</font>

492
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,520
<font color="yellow">Why don't one of you volunteer
before we have a broadcast mishap?</font>

493
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,840
<font color="yellow">Is there a volunteer?</font>

494
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:29,460
<font color="yellow">- Me!
- Me, me!</font>

495
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,380
<font color="yellow">Just don't get caught by
Announcer Geum Soo Jung.</font>

496
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,680
<font color="yellow">Is she my wife or something?</font>

497
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,390
<font color="yellow">We went on one arranged date.</font>

498
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:00,270
<font color="yellow">Yes, but your parents had
already talked before you two met.</font>

499
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,980
<font color="yellow">It's not even cheating.</font>

500
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,020
<font color="yellow">You're just feeling sorry for her and
you want to give her nice clothes.</font>

501
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:10,090
<font color="yellow">That's probably all it is.</font>

502
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,310
<font color="yellow">The phone...</font>

503
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,370
<font color="yellow">Your phone is ringing.</font>

504
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,230
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

505
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,470
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to pick up?</font>

506
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,620
<font color="yellow">I'm so thirsty.</font>

507
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,860
<font color="yellow">What the...</font>

508
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,690
<font color="yellow">What are you doing acting
so rude to your work boss?</font>

509
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:58,910
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that you can't drink water
right after being under anesthesia?</font>

510
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,190
<font color="yellow">You can drink after four hours.</font>

511
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:08,670
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you come with a guardian?
You're being such a pain.</font>

512
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:11,110
<font color="yellow">Seriously, I'm so sick.</font>

513
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:12,780
<font color="yellow">You're one to talk.</font>

514
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,710
<font color="yellow">Why isn't this working?</font>

515
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,540
<font color="yellow">Hey, get your phone.</font>

516
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:26,440
<font color="yellow">Turn it off if you're
not going to pick up!</font>

517
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,420
<font color="yellow">Just suck on this as hard as you can.</font>

518
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:34,600
<font color="yellow">They say it's not good to leave the
anesthetic gas in our lungs, so hurry.</font>

519
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,790
<font color="yellow">I know, I know. I know that too.</font>

520
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,940
<font color="yellow">I'm in so much pain and it's noisy.</font>

521
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,860
<font color="yellow">Did your surgery go well?</font>

522
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,050
<font color="yellow">You probably wish I died.</font>

523
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:57,270
<font color="yellow">Listening to you talk,
I guess it went very well.</font>

524
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,320
<font color="yellow">I told you to get your phone.</font>

525
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,890
<font color="yellow">I'm not expecting a call from anyone.</font>

526
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,840
<font color="yellow">If you're not expecting a call,
would you have a hundred...</font>

527
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:18,600
<font color="yellow">What is this? It's the director's number.</font>

528
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,290
<font color="yellow">Do you think the news is time for you
to show off your looks?</font>

529
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:31,980
<font color="yellow">Is the news broadcast meant
to help you find men to date?</font>

530
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,500
<font color="yellow">Is a weather forecaster a fake announcer?</font>

531
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,610
<font color="yellow">Is the news a place for you
to make an appearance</font>

532
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,720
<font color="yellow">so you can be like celebrities?</font>

533
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,720
<font color="yellow">Is the news...</font>

534
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,700
<font color="yellow">You can do it...
what Pyo Na Ri was doing.</font>

535
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,560
<font color="yellow">- Take that off.
- Excuse me?</font>

536
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,340
<font color="yellow">Wear something else. What is this?</font>

537
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,950
<font color="yellow">Is this the army?</font>

538
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,750
<font color="yellow">She is disciplining them well.</font>

539
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,690
<font color="yellow">Kye Sung Sook should've been born a man.</font>

540
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,350
<font color="yellow">Right, girls?</font>

541
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,650
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

542
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:13,960
<font color="yellow"><i>Why didn't you pick up your phone!</i></font>

543
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,170
<font color="yellow">You were sleeping all day, weren't you?</font>

544
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,980
<font color="yellow">Did you have fun playing for two days?
Get here right now.</font>

545
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,520
<font color="yellow">What? Then, am I working again?</font>

546
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,070
<font color="yellow">Do you know how many times I called?
Okay, forget it.</font>

547
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,760
<font color="yellow">You won't get another chance
if you don't show up. Hurry!</font>

550
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,310
<font color="yellow">What is the forecast for tonight?</font>

551
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:50,950
<font color="yellow">A localized torrential rain?</font>

552
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,540
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,890

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

556
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,680
<font color="yellow">Will the wind be stronger, or the rain?</font>

557
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,080
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

558
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,100
<font color="yellow">Which areas will be in danger?</font>

559
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,100
<font color="yellow">And the maximum expected rain?</font>

00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,750
<font color="yellow">So, you are the weather girl.</font>

571
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,860
<font color="yellow">You must've been visiting
someone in the hospital.</font>

572
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:08,010
<font color="yellow">Well, no. That wasn't really it.</font>

573
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:09,370
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

574
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,580
<font color="yellow">I almost didn't see you.</font>

575
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:23,620
<font color="yellow">Ah, here you go.</font>

576
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,130
<font color="yellow">- No.
- What?</font>

577
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,680
<font color="yellow">This is for the 7 p.m.
weather forecaster.</font>

578
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,560
<font color="yellow">Deliver it to her.</font>

579
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,740
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

580
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,010
<font color="yellow">Then, where is mine?</font>

581
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,680
<font color="yellow">You should have stopped her.</font>

582
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,350
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

583
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,290
<font color="yellow">What is so important about a broadcast?</font>

584
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,870
<font color="yellow">Why would she run out on the day
she got her surgery? Why?</font>

585
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:05,020
<font color="yellow">What if it hasn't healed and
the wound ends up bleeding?</font>

586
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:14,610
<font color="yellow">I wanted her to get married
and receive love.</font>

587
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:18,030
<font color="yellow">I was so careful about it
being even over 0.1 gram.</font>

588

<font color="yellow">I was so careful.</font>

589
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,690
<font color="yellow">I focused so hard to do that surgery.</font>

590
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:25,980
<font color="yellow">She just ran out of her room
like this, that patient!</font>

591
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,340
<font color="yellow">You should clap for him.</font>

592
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,700
<font color="yellow">She thinks a doctors word
is just a big joke.</font>

593
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,680
<font color="yellow">My words are like dog crap.
What is this?</font>

594
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,970
<font color="yellow">This is how people in broadcast are.</font>

595
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,810
<font color="yellow">Are they just fearless or stupid?</font>

596
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,470
<font color="yellow">Maybe they just have no manners.</font>

597
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,720
<font color="yellow">Do they think they have many lives?</font>

598
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,460
<font color="yellow">They don't know how precious
their lives are.</font>

599
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,570
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

600
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:11,230
<font color="yellow">There's a private room open.
You can move there.</font>

601
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,190
<font color="yellow">Even if the patient comes back,
don't accept her.</font>

602
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,920
<font color="yellow">Move him into the private room.</font>

603
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,100
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

604
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,560
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

605
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,140
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri is not here yet, Director.</font>

606
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,060
<font color="yellow">Listen to me. Use Na Joo Hee.</font>

607
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,120
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

608
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,610
<font color="yellow">You'll get good ratings with Na Joo Hee.</font>

609
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:49,000
<font color="yellow">She's prettier and younger.</font>

610
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,840
<font color="yellow">She's not cheap-looking
and she fits our news image.</font>

611
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,070
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri couldn't even imitate her.</font>

612
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:55,410
<font color="yellow">Then, should we do that?</font>

613
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,940
<font color="yellow">So, who is it?
Who are you going to go with?</font>

614
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,830
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Thank you.</font>

615
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,550
<font color="yellow">Hey, you...</font>

616
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,390
<font color="yellow">You should've delivered it properly.</font>

617
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,670
<font color="yellow">They said she's the 7 p.m. weather girl.</font>

618
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:18,450
<font color="yellow">She's not "Head in the Clouds"?</font>

619
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:19,860
<font color="yellow">They switched?</font>

620
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,070
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I can hear you. I can.</font>

621
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,040
<font color="yellow">Make your decision, Director.</font>

622
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,150
<font color="yellow">Stop rushing me.</font>

623
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,490
<font color="yellow">Stop looking for Pyo Na Ri,
who was fired, and just decide already.</font>

624
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:42,140
<font color="yellow">Is this Pyo Na Ri, who was fired,
the one you were waiting for?</font>

625
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:47,030
<font color="yellow">Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Chungcheong...</font>

626
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:49,540
<font color="yellow">The expected precipitation...</font>

627
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:54,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm so dizzy.</font>

628
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,360
<font color="yellow">I wonder if she's going to
wear Mom's clothes today.</font>

629
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,550
<font color="yellow">Do your mom's clothes fit Na Ri?</font>

630
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:13,400
<font color="yellow">My sister looks prettier than anyone
in the world in those clothes.</font>

631
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,100
<font color="yellow">You'll see.</font>

632
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,460
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I'm late!</font>

633
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:30,460
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

634
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,360
<font color="yellow">Sorry, sorry.</font>

635
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,240
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Director. I'm sorry.</font>

636
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,600
<font color="yellow">Is she here? Is she, Director?</font>

637
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,050
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri's here?</font>

638
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:41,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, she is.</font>

639
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Director. I'm sorry.</font>

640
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,690
<font color="yellow">Is this why you gave me all that alcohol?</font>

641
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:06,390
<font color="yellow">This... isn't your spot anymore.</font>

642
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,250
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can even do it?</font>

643
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:20,090
<font color="yellow">Yes, I can do it.</font>

644
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,980
<font color="yellow">Where are those clothes from?</font>

645
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,090
<font color="yellow">Let's just say it is cheating.</font>

646
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:38,460
<font color="yellow">I think I am cheating.</font>

We have to start soon.</font>
