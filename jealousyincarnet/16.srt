1
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,540
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's eat everyone. Let's eat.</font>

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,260
<font color="yellow">It's hot. Be careful.</font>

3
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,030
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the food.</font>

4
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,530
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,150
<font color="yellow">Your uncle must be back.</font>

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,570
<font color="yellow">Red, you look very young today.</font>

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,770
<font color="yellow">What did you do different?
You look like a teenager.</font>

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,190
<font color="yellow">We are all teenagers.</font>

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,200
<font color="yellow">Right? What's wrong with me?</font>

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,490
<font color="yellow">I thought you were all in your twenties.</font>

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,300
<font color="yellow">I must be crazy.</font>

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,330
<font color="yellow">It's nonsense.</font>

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,050
<font color="yellow">Why is he staring?</font>

14
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,120
<font color="yellow">Eat up. Eat, eat.</font>

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,470
<font color="yellow">It's getting cold.</font>

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,830
<font color="yellow"><i>Pyo Na Ri!</i></font>

17
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,850
<font color="yellow">Just date us both.</font>

18
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,630
<font color="yellow">She can date us both and then
choose which one of us she prefers.</font>

19
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,920
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Lee...
- Date both of us.</font>

20
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,170
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,490
<font color="yellow">I want to sleep.</font>

22
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,840
<font color="yellow">I'm going to jump over to your roof then.</font>

23
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,320
<font color="yellow">Do you want to break your leg?</font>

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,750
<font color="yellow">Make me ramen too.</font>

25
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,870
<font color="yellow">You want me to date both of you
and make you ramen.</font>

26
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,470
<font color="yellow"><i>Why do you want so much?</i></font>

27
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,560
<font color="yellow">You're going to do it though.</font>

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,040
<font color="yellow">- Who is?
- You are.</font>

29
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,420
<font color="yellow">Look here.</font>

30
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,110
<font color="yellow">You'll end up doing
what I'm asking you to do.</font>

31
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,530
<font color="yellow">- Buy me an ice cream.
- I'm going to sleep.</font>

32
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,560
<font color="yellow">Now.</font>

33
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,910
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do now?</font>

34
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,660
<font color="yellow">You've been caught by
Announcer Geum's parents and your father.</font>

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,510
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do now,
you bastard?</font>

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,040
<font color="yellow">Let go. Let me go!</font>

37
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,850
<font color="yellow">You poured in too much water.
It's not salty enough.</font>

38
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,520
<font color="yellow">You said you didn't like salty food.</font>

39
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,590
<font color="yellow">Still, the seasoning
should be just right.</font>

40
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,820
<font color="yellow">This one or this one?</font>

41
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,070
<font color="yellow">Neither.</font>

42
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,970
<font color="yellow">Open it for me.</font>

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,040
<font color="yellow">Don't you have your own hands?</font>

44
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,770
<font color="yellow">I want to be loved.</font>

45
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,330
<font color="yellow">If you open it for me,
I feel like I'm being loved.</font>

46
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,030
<font color="yellow">It'll be like we're dating and
you like me more than I like you.</font>

47
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,190
<font color="yellow">Don't eat it if you don't want to.</font>

48
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,290
<font color="yellow">You would've opened it for me
if I hadn't said anything, right?</font>

49
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,750
<font color="yellow">What did you do for a month?</font>

50
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,290
<font color="yellow">You went on like a dozen
arranged dates during the month.</font>

51
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,920
<font color="yellow">I went 10 times, not a dozen times.</font>

52
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,280
<font color="yellow">You have two more this week.</font>

53
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,180
<font color="yellow">What? Are you a police detective?</font>

54
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,900
<font color="yellow">That's mine.</font>

55
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,690
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing here?</font>

56
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,300
<font color="yellow">I'm going to date another man.</font>

57
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,370
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

58
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,340
<font color="yellow">shut your mouth.</font>

59
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,720
<font color="yellow">I'm going to date a man
who has no friends.</font>

60
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,240
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

61
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,970
<font color="yellow">Not a man with lots of money.</font>

62
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,970
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth.</font>

63
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:15,400
<font color="yellow">Not one who's so great
that he makes me anxious.</font>

64
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,320
<font color="yellow">I said shut your mouth.</font>

65
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,220
<font color="yellow">I'm lonely.</font>

66
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,910
<font color="yellow">You have two guys
so why would you be lonely?</font>

67
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,970
<font color="yellow">What guys? I don't have any right now.</font>

68
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,190
<font color="yellow">This girl is getting
funnier by the minute.</font>

69
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,300
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

70
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,350
<font color="yellow">Sit down, would you?</font>

71
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,010
<font color="yellow">Sit.</font>

72
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,480
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

73
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,250
<font color="yellow">How come you don't listen
when I tell you to sit</font>

74
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,030
<font color="yellow">but you listen to Go Jung Won?</font>

75
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,440
<font color="yellow">You had those dates at my hotel,
so you weren't really trying to move on.</font>

76
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,910
<font color="yellow">You did it to show me and
pretend that you were doing well now.</font>

77
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,410
<font color="yellow">- Stop pretending.
- Let's all do it.</font>

78
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,010
<font color="yellow">Are you serious about that?</font>

79
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,170
<font color="yellow">You don't want to?</font>

80
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,700
<font color="yellow">Why would I do such a thing?</font>

81
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,410
<font color="yellow">Yes, I said I had two hearts and
did a crazy thing with two men.</font>

82
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,190
<font color="yellow">Are you saying this is how
I have to take responsibility for it?</font>

83
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,600
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

84
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,220
<font color="yellow">I am sorry for that.</font>

85
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,840
<font color="yellow">I admit I was wrong.</font>

86
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,550
<font color="yellow">So, let's be clean of this and move on.</font>

87
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,530
<font color="yellow">I'm saying let's not be together
in this awkward way ever again.</font>

88
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,950
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me,
Reporter Lee?</font>

89
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,480
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to see you two again.</font>

90
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,530
<font color="yellow">Don't come here again.</font>

91
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,850
<font color="yellow">Just... date both of us.</font>

92
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,670
<font color="yellow">You can date Hwa Shin too.</font>

93
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,810
<font color="yellow">President Go!</font>

94
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,110
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

95
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,590
<font color="yellow">Eat it. It's good for us at our age.</font>

96
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,110
<font color="yellow">We should prepare. It will come soon.</font>

97
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,710
<font color="yellow">I don't need it. I'm still strong.</font>

98
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,800
<font color="yellow">What? Who are you kidding?</font>

99
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,070
<font color="yellow">You have the fan on every night
saying it's hot, even in this weather.</font>

100
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,180
<font color="yellow">I'm only eating it
because you gave it to me.</font>

101
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,680
<font color="yellow">Eat lots beforehand
or we'll end up that way too.</font>

102
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,250
<font color="yellow">Change the light bulb.</font>

103
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,560
<font color="yellow">You do it.</font>

104
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,960
<font color="yellow">How can I do it?
I can't even reach it.</font>

105
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,170
<font color="yellow">We don't even have a man to change it.</font>

106
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,450
<font color="yellow">What have we been doing with our lives?</font>

107
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting
like this too, President?</font>

108
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,800
<font color="yellow">Even if you refuse to do it,
Hwa Shin will not stop.</font>

109
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,420
<font color="yellow">If I can be in your heart
for a little longer...</font>

110
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,350
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

111
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,730
<font color="yellow">I want you all for myself.</font>

112
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,670
<font color="yellow">But those are just my feelings.</font>

113
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,800
<font color="yellow">You like us both and it confuses you
enough that you broke up with us.</font>

114
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,010
<font color="yellow">So this is your chance.</font>

115
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,190
<font color="yellow">You can get to know me better
and date me.</font>

116
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,290
<font color="yellow">Get to know my feelings better.</font>

117
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,040
<font color="yellow">- Let's do it.
- Good, then.</font>

118
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,370
<font color="yellow">We'll start tomorrow.</font>

119
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,770
<font color="yellow">It's not like you're doing this
behind our backs.</font>

120
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,450
<font color="yellow">We are asking you to do it.</font>

121
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,760
<font color="yellow">You don't need to be sorry.</font>

122
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,170
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri doesn't need
to give her permission.</font>

123
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,810
<font color="yellow">It would be strange for her to okay this.</font>

124
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,530
<font color="yellow">Right? I am not okay with it.</font>

125
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,800
<font color="yellow">Why would you do
something like this, President?</font>

126
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,230
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee,
do you really want to do this?</font>

127
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,610
<font color="yellow">A weird relationship like this? Really?</font>

128
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,520
<font color="yellow">We didn't even get to start at all.
I feel very wronged.</font>

129
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,020
<font color="yellow">I feel more wronged.
My friend betrayed me.</font>

130
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,170
<font color="yellow">Forget about common sense or
whether this is ridiculous or not.</font>

131
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,790
<font color="yellow">Is anyone going to give you
an award for ending it like this?</font>

132
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,890
<font color="yellow">Are you going to hang
that award up somewhere?</font>

133
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,340
<font color="yellow">I guess you'll receive
the "Regret" award.</font>

134
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,140
<font color="yellow">You'll get the "Regret" trophy.</font>

135
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,460
<font color="yellow">All three of us will know
that I'm dating the both of you.</font>

136
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,970
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do in the middle?</font>

137
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,000
<font color="yellow">Sure, I can forget about my pride.</font>

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,790
<font color="yellow">I can restart that difficult
one-sided love I was in for three years.</font>

139
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,350
<font color="yellow">But, date two guys?
I can't date two guys.</font>

140
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,340
<font color="yellow">It doesn't suit me at all.</font>

141
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,470
<font color="yellow">I'm about to get angry.</font>

142
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,160
<font color="yellow">What do you people take me for?</font>

143
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,770
<font color="yellow">You come here so blatantly
like you're giving me a present.</font>

144
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,330
<font color="yellow">You're telling me to date two men
as if you're proposing to me.</font>

145
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,930
<font color="yellow">I will never do it.</font>

146
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,090
<font color="yellow">Who am I to do that? I can't do it.</font>

147
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,990
<font color="yellow">I'm busy enough making a living.</font>

148
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,440
<font color="yellow">You want me to... what?</font>

149
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,660
<font color="yellow">Date two men at the same time?</font>

150
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,460
<font color="yellow">Don't come back here again.
I'm very serious.</font>

151
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,000
<font color="yellow">Why are you becoming crazy like me?</font>

152
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,950
<font color="yellow">You're making me crazy.</font>

153
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,830
<font color="yellow">Sorry about today, but...</font>

154
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,090
<font color="yellow">Hey, you went too far.</font>

155
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,230
<font color="yellow">How will I look to the parents?</font>

156
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,140
<font color="yellow">You're just like the rumors say.
I thought you might be nice.</font>

157
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,100
<font color="yellow">You must not know because
you've fallen so hard for Pyo Na Ri.</font>

158
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,730
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri liked Reporter Lee
a lot for three years.</font>

159
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,790
<font color="yellow">It was surprising that
Reporter Lee wasn't swayed</font>

160
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,390
<font color="yellow">by that kind of devoted love.</font>

161
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,710
<font color="yellow">I'll come here every night.</font>

162
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,560
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you one thing Pyo Na Ri did
for Reporter Lee every time I come.</font>

163
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,460
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you just how much
she loved Reporter Lee in detail.</font>

164
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,330
<font color="yellow">You can go to bed every night
thinking about that.</font>

165
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,240
<font color="yellow">You're curious, right?</font>

166
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,220
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything better to do?</font>

167
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,520
<font color="yellow">No, thanks to you.</font>

168
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,610
<font color="yellow">I won't let you love so easily.</font>

169
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,790
<font color="yellow">Your true nature is very sexy.</font>

170
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,540
<font color="yellow">Go play somewhere else.</font>

171
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,470
<font color="yellow">Marry for love? How tacky of you.</font>

172
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,520
<font color="yellow">I'm rooting for Reporter Lee Hwa Shin.</font>

173
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,230
<font color="yellow">I told you not to drink, didn't I?</font>

174
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,240
<font color="yellow">I bought you cup ramen and ice cream.</font>

175
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,120
<font color="yellow">I even came out while I was sleeping.</font>

176
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,850
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you listen to me now? Huh?</font>

177
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,170
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

178
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,840
<font color="yellow">Stop drinking right now!</font>

179
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,560
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to upset me on purpose
drinking right in front me?</font>

180
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,450
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to die or something?</font>

181
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,490
<font color="yellow">You're so annoying!</font>

182
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,460
<font color="yellow">Please stop drinking in front of me!</font>

183
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,960
<font color="yellow">Are you worried about me?</font>

184
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,360
<font color="yellow">You can come here next to me if you are.</font>

185
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,070
<font color="yellow">You need to do something about
that mouth of yours, Reporter Lee.</font>

186
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,270
<font color="yellow">Just don't open your mouth at all.</font>

187
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,560
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't talk or drink.
Just shut it.</font>

188
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,870
<font color="yellow">Go back to your mom's house
and live there, please.</font>

189
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,720
<font color="yellow">Am I a child?
Why would I live with my mom?</font>

190
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,070
<font color="yellow">I could live with you.</font>

191
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,910
<font color="yellow">You can come over here if you're worried.</font>

192
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,060
<font color="yellow">I don't want to sleep alone.</font>

193
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,790
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

194
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,420
<font color="yellow">Sleep with me.</font>

195
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,180
<font color="yellow">Sleep with me.</font>

196
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,260
<font color="yellow"><i>Sleep with me.</i></font>

197
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,450
<font color="yellow"><i>Sleep with me.</i></font>

198
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,400
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

199
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,190
<font color="yellow">Mommy!</font>

200
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,320
<font color="yellow">Why are you here making me feel bad?</font>

201
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,020
<font color="yellow">Is that why you came out
an hour early? To run away?</font>

202
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,360
<font color="yellow">What is it? Are you looking for Hwa Shin?</font>

203
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,660
<font color="yellow">No. No, I'm not.</font>

204
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,540
<font color="yellow">Don't think about Hwa Shin
when you're with me.</font>

205
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,390
<font color="yellow">When I'm with you, I think about him.</font>

206
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,120
<font color="yellow">When I'm with him, I think about you.</font>

207
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,490
<font color="yellow">Why? Can't I do that?</font>

208
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,830
<font color="yellow">When you're with me,
think of only me, okay?</font>

209
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,840
<font color="yellow">I can't control that and what can
I do when the opposite happens?</font>

210
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,100
<font color="yellow">That's why I said I didn't
want to date both of you.</font>

211
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,440
<font color="yellow">I really can't do that.</font>

212
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,440
<font color="yellow">Why are you here early in the morning
making me feel sorry to you?</font>

213
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,850
<font color="yellow">I can't control my feelings.</font>

214
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,320
<font color="yellow">I'm not very smart,
so I can't control my thoughts either.</font>

215
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,320
<font color="yellow">I just feel guilty and I feel ashamed.</font>

216
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,270
<font color="yellow">I keep doing the
opposite of what I want to.</font>

217
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,470
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

218
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,710
<font color="yellow">Then think about Hwa Shin
when you're with me.</font>

219
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,720
<font color="yellow">Make sure to think about me
when you're with Hwa Shin, okay?</font>

220
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,940
<font color="yellow"><i>Is this guy crazy too?</i></font>

221
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,970
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

222
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,580
<font color="yellow">You just thought "Is this guy crazy?"</font>

223
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,580
<font color="yellow">Don't call me President from now on.</font>

224
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,650
<font color="yellow">Don't use titles.</font>

225
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,220
<font color="yellow">Say "Hey, you" or "That guy."</font>

226
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,230
<font color="yellow">If you call me "Go Jung Won" or
"Jung Won" 100 times, we can break up.</font>

227
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,410
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

228
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,090
<font color="yellow">- Try it.
- Really?</font>

229
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,220
<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

230
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,110
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jung Won.</font>

231
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,720
<font color="yellow">What? That was twice.</font>

232
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,560
<font color="yellow">Jung Won.</font>

233
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,170
<font color="yellow">Three times.</font>

234
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,090
<font color="yellow">Is this guy crazy?</font>

235
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,980
<font color="yellow">Good, good. Give that to me.</font>

236
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,250
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. Let go of it.</font>

237
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,110
<font color="yellow">Come on, get in. Get in the car.</font>

238
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,780
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

239
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,940
<font color="yellow">She's good at it.</font>

240
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,670
<font color="yellow">Help me. I like her... more...</font>

241
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,780
<font color="yellow">She must have gotten
a ride from Jung Won.</font>

242
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,060
<font color="yellow">Do well today. Go on in.</font>

243
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,690
<font color="yellow">Say thank you. I did something good.</font>

244
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,390
<font color="yellow">Don't you have any manners?</font>

245
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,340
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously?</font>

246
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,100
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, this girl came by.</font>

247
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,660
<font color="yellow">She said she'd come every night</font>

248
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,330
<font color="yellow">and tell me the things you did
when you liked Hwa Shin.</font>

249
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,040
<font color="yellow">I have to dream of those things
every night, so what do I do?</font>

250
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,560
<font color="yellow">You should be held responsible.</font>

251
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,790
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

252
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,270
<font color="yellow">Who has nothing better to do?</font>

253
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,140
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you over dinner.
Come if you're curious.</font>

254
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,280
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

255
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,600
<font color="yellow">Hey... hey!</font>

256
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,990
<font color="yellow">Home sharing is a new way of living
where strangers of different genders</font>

257
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,560
<font color="yellow">come to live in a home together.</font>

258
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,000
<font color="yellow">It first started in Barcelona.</font>

259
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,040
<font color="yellow">It then spread to Paris and all over
Europe before entering our country.</font>

260
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,720
<font color="yellow">It is a way to live with
low rent and have company.</font>

261
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,620
<font color="yellow">Therefore, it is very popular with
college students and single people.</font>

262
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,590
<font color="yellow">It is said that many
people end up meeting</font>

263
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,630
<font color="yellow">and marrying in these homes, as well.</font>

264
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,740
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee Young Seok has the story.</font>

265
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,190
<font color="yellow"><i>This is a shared house in Seoul.</i></font>

266
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,600
<font color="yellow"><i>According to recent surveys</i></font>

267
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,360
<font color="yellow"><i>6 out of 10 people
in their twenties and thirties</i></font>

268
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,510
<font color="yellow"><i>said they wanted
to live in a shared house.</i></font>

269
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,990
<font color="yellow"><i>They also said
they intended on living in one.</i></font>

270
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,020
<font color="yellow"><i>Those who lived alone were a large factor</i></font>

271
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,750
<font color="yellow"><i>in the rise in popularity
of shared houses.</i></font>

272
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:21,180
<font color="yellow"><i>The biggest concern about a shared house
is getting along with housemates.</i></font>

273
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,390
<font color="yellow">It's been a month since you've come in.</font>

274
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,950
<font color="yellow">Yes. Hello, Director.</font>

275
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,290
<font color="yellow">Still no manners.</font>

276
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,300
<font color="yellow">I came back from England.
It's been three years, Hwa Shin.</font>

277
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,340
<font color="yellow">Hello, Senior.</font>

278
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,750
<font color="yellow">There's a flickering bulb in our house.
Can you come change it?</font>

279
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,970
<font color="yellow">It's not out yet if it's flickering.</font>

280
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,070
<font color="yellow">It's still on, so I'll change it
when it's completely out.</font>

281
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,600
<font color="yellow">It's causing such a headache
that we can't go into the room.</font>

282
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,270
<font color="yellow">Then you two can leave the house.</font>

283
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,440
<font color="yellow">- You have nice houses.
- I'll change it for you.</font>

284
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,500
<font color="yellow">Why would you?</font>

285
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,480
<font color="yellow">Director, why don't you come do it?</font>

286
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,700
<font color="yellow">Why would I?</font>

287
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,290
<font color="yellow">Put some nails in the wall for us, too.</font>

288
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,670
<font color="yellow">Why would I go to your house to
change light bulbs and hammer in nails?</font>

289
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,940
<font color="yellow">Why can't you do it?</font>

290
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,520
<font color="yellow">Sung Sook, I'll do it
after we finish the news.</font>

291
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,870
<font color="yellow">Where do you live?</font>

292
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,950
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't let just any man
into the house.</font>

293
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,180
<font color="yellow">Why am I just "any man"?</font>

294
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,640
<font color="yellow">Wait. If he's just "any man,"
then what am I?</font>

295
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,660
<font color="yellow">What am I that I would go to your house
to change light bulbs and put in nails?</font>

296
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,160
<font color="yellow">- What am I?
- Oh...</font>

297
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,680
<font color="yellow">- You are...
- Yes?</font>

298
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,550
<font color="yellow">Just a... comfortable man?</font>

299
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,220
<font color="yellow">Your servant? Okay.</font>

300
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,700
<font color="yellow">Ah, so when you call me "any man,"
it's because I make you nervous.</font>

301
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,350
<font color="yellow">A man should make a woman nervous,
isn't that right Hwa Shin?</font>

302
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,930
<font color="yellow">What a joke.</font>

303
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,070
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin, you got
your notification, right?</font>

304
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,720
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Okay.</font>

305
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,550
<font color="yellow">Do a good job with Hong Hye Won.</font>

306
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,090
<font color="yellow">Okay. There are lots of men
to change the light bulbs.</font>

307
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,540
<font color="yellow">That guy needs a beating
to pull himself together.</font>

308
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,540
<font color="yellow"><i>Sleep with me, sleep with me,
sleep with me, sleep with me.</i></font>

309
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,560
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well?</font>

310
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,870
<font color="yellow">You were good today.</font>

311
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,270
<font color="yellow">You looked good on screen too.</font>

312
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,430
<font color="yellow">Have you been going to
the hospital in the past month?</font>

313
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,420
<font color="yellow">Hey, is that the only thing
you're curious about?</font>

314
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,990
<font color="yellow">I'm not a patient. I'm a man... a man.</font>

315
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,820
<font color="yellow">Not a patient. A man... a guy.</font>

316
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,210
<font color="yellow">- I'll get going.
- Need any light bulbs changed at home?</font>

317
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,930
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

318
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,110
<font color="yellow">- Nails that need hammering?
- I have Chi Yeol.</font>

319
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,280
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner later.</font>

320
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,350
<font color="yellow">I have an arranged blind date later.</font>

321
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,810
<font color="yellow">Well, then...</font>

322
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,210
<font color="yellow">Hey, eat more.</font>

323
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,790
<font color="yellow">- Eat with me.
- Take your time eating.</font>

324
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,400
<font color="yellow">Did you get a ride from
Jung Won this morning?</font>

325
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,760
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

326
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,220
<font color="yellow">You haven't forgotten about going
on that date in my place, right?</font>

327
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,740
<font color="yellow">No. Don't worry.</font>

328
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,420
<font color="yellow">Did you know Go Jung Won tried
to help you on the day of your test?</font>

329
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,850
<font color="yellow">It seemed like you didn't know.</font>

330
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,380
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

331
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,250
<font color="yellow">Due to the sharp rise in
the price of cigarettes last year</font>

332
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,520
<font color="yellow">the decreasing sales in volume of
cigarettes had an increase in...</font>

333
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,010
<font color="yellow">Wow, Hwa Shin sure is lucky.</font>

334
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:40,780
<font color="yellow">Reporter Woo, who got the 7 p.m. spot,
ended up being a foreign correspondent.</font>

335
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,310
<font color="yellow">Now he gets to take his empty spot
even though he was disciplined.</font>

336
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,810
<font color="yellow">You're the lucky one.</font>

337
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,580
<font color="yellow">If Hwa Shin hadn't been disciplined,
you wouldn't be in the 9 p.m. slot.</font>

338
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,500
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri's going on that date for you?</font>

339
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,220
<font color="yellow">Aren't you and Pyo Na Ri over?</font>

340
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,480
<font color="yellow">Is he a decent guy?</font>

341
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,920
<font color="yellow">Are you holding on to her?</font>

342
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,190
<font color="yellow">- Are you being messy about it?
- Forget it.</font>

343
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,240
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't send her
if it were a decent guy.</font>

344
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,650
<font color="yellow">I did ask her to go because
he didn't seem so great.</font>

345
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,980
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened,
but he's sending a replacement.</font>

346
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,310
<font color="yellow">- Who is he sending?
- Someone good.</font>

347
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,580
<font color="yellow">Must be someone very aggressive.</font>

348
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,740
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

349
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,440
<font color="yellow">If you're so curious,
forget the live news and go.</font>

350
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,470
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

351
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,210
<font color="yellow">If your love is that great,
I will acknowledge it.</font>

352
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,150
<font color="yellow">I will acknowledge that your love is
unlike any love in this century.</font>

353
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,990
<font color="yellow">What is he doing? Hey.</font>

354
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,180
<font color="yellow">Sit down now.</font>

355
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,140
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to go.</font>

356
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,330
<font color="yellow">You want to keep pushing me?</font>

357
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,320
<font color="yellow">You said you'd be a son a bitch.
You were like a little puppy.</font>

358
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,100
<font color="yellow">You're a coward.</font>

359
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,250
<font color="yellow">It's at W Hotel in Cheongdam-dong
at seven o'clock.</font>

360
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,230
<font color="yellow">- Hwa Shin!
- They must be meeting now.</font>

361
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,510
<font color="yellow">Sit down now.</font>

362
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,550
<font color="yellow">- Hey! Where are you going?
- What is it? What?</font>

363
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,860
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- Hwa Shin!</font>

364
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,320
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going?
- Hwa Shin!</font>

365
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,870
<font color="yellow">Three seconds... anchor, stand by!</font>

366
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,440
<font color="yellow">Jo Deuk Hwan, a close associate
of fraud Jo Sang Chil</font>

367
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,380
<font color="yellow">was arrested in China
after four years on the run.</font>

368
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,270
<font color="yellow">You are Announcer Pyo Na Ri, right?</font>

369
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,200
<font color="yellow">I am Go Jung Won. Nice to meet you.</font>

370
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,670
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Go and catch Hwa Shin now.</font>

371
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,710
<font color="yellow">I went to use the restroom. Sorry.</font>

372
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,690
<font color="yellow">- Are you in your right mind?
- Yes.</font>

373
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,420
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

374
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,250
<font color="yellow">You pulled that stunt
with the helicopter</font>

375
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,630
<font color="yellow">and you go to the restroom
when we're live?</font>

376
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,650
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

377
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,850
<font color="yellow">I'm getting 10,000 new white hairs
a day because of you.</font>

378
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,530
<font color="yellow">Hey! You shouldn't have had any water.</font>

379
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,970
<font color="yellow">Even if you have to pee,
you should stay in your seat.</font>

380
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,550
<font color="yellow">Even if there is a bomb dropping,
an anchor must stay in his seat.</font>

381
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,990
<font color="yellow">It was a Hong Hye Won solo shot
for the next line.</font>

382
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,880
<font color="yellow">I knew I could go for a bit because
I wasn't going to be on screen.</font>

383
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,030
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you have some sort of issue?
What's wrong with you?</font>

384
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,280
<font color="yellow">The light is coming on.</font>

385
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,830
<font color="yellow">With the excess supply of crude oil
continuing to be an issue</font>

386
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,040
<font color="yellow">international oil prices
have fallen below 40 dollars.</font>

387
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,710
<font color="yellow">Reporter Kwon Joon Hyuk has the story.</font>

388
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,970
<font color="yellow">Let's pretend this is the first time we
met and that Hwa Shin didn't set us up.</font>

389
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,070
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

390
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,200
<font color="yellow">Sorry, but someone will be
coming to sit there soon.</font>

391
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,290
<font color="yellow">Stop doing these dates.</font>

392
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,680
<font color="yellow">Just date me and Hwa Shin.</font>

393
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,100
<font color="yellow">It would be even better
if you didn't meet Hwa Shin.</font>

394
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,420
<font color="yellow">You're already dating two men.
To go on blind dates on top of that...</font>

395
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,810
<font color="yellow">Isn't that being too cruel to us?</font>

396
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,050
<font color="yellow">Who said I was going to date you two?</font>

397
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,820
<font color="yellow">Someone is coming soon.</font>

398
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,770
<font color="yellow">He isn't going to come.</font>

399
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,780
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- Well...</font>

400
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,200
<font color="yellow">I told him my girlfriend was only doing
this because she was mad at me.</font>

401
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,690
<font color="yellow">That she's someone
I'm considering marrying.</font>

402
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,880
<font color="yellow">Why would you lie?</font>

403
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,630
<font color="yellow">Lie? What lie?</font>

404
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,630
<font color="yellow">I never lied.</font>

405
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,210
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

406
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,850
<font color="yellow">What is it? Are you not feeling well?</font>

407
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,810
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

408
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,820
<font color="yellow">I'll drive you.</font>

409
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,980
<font color="yellow"><i>That she's someone
I'm considering marrying.</i></font>

410
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,080
<font color="yellow">I've never been told that before.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>That she's someone
I'm considering marrying.</i></font>

412
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,040
<font color="yellow">No, no, no, no.
Get it together. Get it together.</font>

413
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,560
<font color="yellow">Scary, scary.</font>

414
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,020
<font color="yellow">Hey... he didn't ask to
see you again, did he?</font>

415
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:45,370
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee, I haven't ever
really thought about marriage before.</font>

416
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,320
<font color="yellow">Did that guy ask you to marry him?</font>

417
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,780
<font color="yellow">What kind of a guy brings up marriage
after meeting you just once?</font>

418
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,360
<font color="yellow">How would he know if he wants
to marry you or not? Is he crazy?</font>

419
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,130
<font color="yellow">Is he any crazier than a guy who
tells me to date two men at once?</font>

420
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,970
<font color="yellow">- Let's watch a movie tomorrow.
- <i>Let's watch a movie tomorrow.</i></font>

421
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,050
<font color="yellow">- Are you busy?
- <i>Are you busy?</i></font>

422
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,580
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Lee.
- Is your finger broken?</font>

423
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,470
<font color="yellow">- You should call.
- Why don't you respond to my texts?</font>

424
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,680
<font color="yellow">Are you still wearing
the clothes Jung Won gives you?</font>

425
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,370
<font color="yellow">You're not doing broadcasts
with Hwa Shin, are you?</font>

426
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,700
<font color="yellow">Don't wear them.</font>

427
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,680
<font color="yellow">Take that off. Wear my clothes.</font>

428
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,570
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Lee.
- What should we do this weekend?</font>

429
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,010
<font color="yellow">What should we do this weekend?</font>

430
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,620
<font color="yellow">Don't think about Jung Won
when you're with me.</font>

431
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,870
<font color="yellow">Don't think about Hwa Shin
when you're with me.</font>

432
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,770
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, Reporter Lee.
- What?</font>

433
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,880
<font color="yellow">I'm so confused and dizzy.
This is so difficult.</font>

434
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,480
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm about to wither
and die because this is so hard.</font>

435
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,370
<font color="yellow">If you insist on me dating both of you</font>

436
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,710
<font color="yellow">how about I date Jung Won this month
and then date you next month?</font>

437
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,780
<font color="yellow">How about taking turns like that?</font>

438
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,410
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Why not?</font>

439
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,950
<font color="yellow">You'll fall for him in one month and
you won't date me when my turn comes.</font>

440
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:56,050
<font color="yellow">We could change the order,
but then Jung Won will say no.</font>

441
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,030
<font color="yellow">I won't fall for him and I promise
I will date you next month.</font>

442
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,080
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Then...</font>

443
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,200
<font color="yellow">How about mornings with you
and nights with Jung Won?</font>

444
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,990
<font color="yellow">How about we divide up the time?</font>

445
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,760
<font color="yellow">No, nights...</font>

446
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,630
<font color="yellow">I like nights. I want nights.</font>

447
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,040
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do at night?</font>

448
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:18,560
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to do any of
the things you are thinking about.</font>

449
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,150
<font color="yellow">I want to hold your hand, hold you,
kiss you, and sleep with you at night.</font>

450
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,060
<font color="yellow">That's what I thought.</font>

451
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,560
<font color="yellow">If you can do it in the morning,
I can do mornings.</font>

452
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,050
<font color="yellow">I won't do it at night and
there's no chance in the morning.</font>

453
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,850
<font color="yellow">- Then, when?
- Reporter Lee.</font>

454
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,950
<font color="yellow">I should have a conscience
and manners if I date two men.</font>

455
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,880
<font color="yellow">How can I do all that with two men?</font>

456
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,140
<font color="yellow">Are you insane?</font>

457
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,530
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm saying I can't do it.</font>

458
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,550
<font color="yellow">Do you really like both of us
the same amount?</font>

459
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,730
<font color="yellow">When I liked you four years ago</font>

460
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,620
<font color="yellow">how nice would it have been
if you had looked my way too?</font>

461
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,660
<font color="yellow">I liked you so much for three years.</font>

462
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:02,380
<font color="yellow">Back then... you wouldn't even
shoot me one kind glance.</font>

463
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,930
<font color="yellow">It's not like it costs you money.
You couldn't even say one kind word.</font>

464
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,630
<font color="yellow">Why are you showing up now
and giving me such a headache?</font>

465
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,410
<font color="yellow">It is much nicer to receive love
than it is to give love.</font>

466
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,140
<font color="yellow">Receiving love makes life easier.</font>

467
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,190
<font color="yellow">Things were so good with Go Jung Won,
so why come now and ruin things?</font>

468
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,290
<font color="yellow">Do you like Jung Won more?</font>

469
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:29,050
<font color="yellow">I don't know! I don't know, I don't know.</font>

470
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,630
<font color="yellow">You like me more, don't you?</font>

471
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,960
<font color="yellow">My feelings for you are
hidden deep inside my heart.</font>

472
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,880
<font color="yellow">So how am I even supposed to know?</font>

473
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,280
<font color="yellow">I thought I had no feelings left at all,
but they keep popping up.</font>

474
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,960
<font color="yellow">They're so deeply hidden that
even I don't know they're there.</font>

475
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,340
<font color="yellow">So how can I know who I like more?</font>

476
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,070
<font color="yellow"><i>Do a good job.</i></font>

477
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,510
<font color="yellow"><i>Can you hold me tightly?</i></font>

478
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,670
<font color="yellow">- Tighter.
- Are you almost done?</font>

479
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,820
<font color="yellow">It's done.</font>

480
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,910
<font color="yellow">Bang Ja Young, turn on the lights.</font>

481
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,470
<font color="yellow">That's strange.</font>

482
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,410
<font color="yellow">Should we try once more?</font>

483
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,420
<font color="yellow">You said you knew what you were doing</font>

484
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,470
<font color="yellow">and that you weren't a man
if you couldn't do it.</font>

485
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,400
<font color="yellow">- Get off.
- Hey!</font>

486
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,690
<font color="yellow">It is scary.</font>

487
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,470
<font color="yellow">What should we do? Call Chef?</font>

488
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,780
<font color="yellow">What else can we do? Call Chef.</font>

489
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,320
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Chef.</font>

490
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,230
<font color="yellow">I changed the electrical conductor.
You shouldn't have trouble anymore.</font>

491
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,260
<font color="yellow">If I knew that was the problem,
I could have done it easily.</font>

492
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,780
<font color="yellow">What? Are you feeling jealous because
Chef could do something you couldn't?</font>

493
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,120
<font color="yellow">Ah, my stomach hurts.</font>

494
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,810
<font color="yellow">The bathroom is outside, right?
I'll be back.</font>

495
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,670
<font color="yellow">Since only women live here,
it's a bit of a problem.</font>

496
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,430
<font color="yellow">We're sorry we had to ask you.</font>

497
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,740
<font color="yellow">Call me whenever you need.
I'm your neighbor.</font>

498
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,150
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

499
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,530
<font color="yellow">How did it go in there?</font>

500
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,890
<font color="yellow">It looks like you really plugged it up.</font>

501
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,430
<font color="yellow">You'll need to call a plumber tomorrow.</font>

502
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,250
<font color="yellow">The toilets in England aren't like this.</font>

503
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,930
<font color="yellow">The toilets here are very sensitive.</font>

504
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,300
<font color="yellow">I brought you here to fix the light.</font>

505
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,450
<font color="yellow">Why would you break the toilet?</font>

506
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,300
<font color="yellow">It's not like you even
bought us toilet paper.</font>

507
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,920
<font color="yellow">Are you marking your territory or what?</font>

508
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,730
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that?</font>

509
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,640
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do? What?</font>

510
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,590
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry. I'll take care of it.</font>

511
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,590
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

512
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,390
<font color="yellow">Don't call me President from now on.
Don't use titles.</font>

513
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,000
<font color="yellow">Say "Hey, you" or "That guy."</font>

514
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,120
<font color="yellow">Call me "Go Jung Won" or "Jung Won."</font>

515
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,580
<font color="yellow"><i>[JUNG WON]</i></font>

516
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,160
<font color="yellow"><i>[REPORTER LEE]</i></font>

517
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,650
<font color="yellow"><i>[PYO NA RI]</i></font>

518
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:34,300
<font color="yellow">This world is full of breasts.</font>

519
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,830
<font color="yellow">Why must it be my son's breast?</font>

520
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,450
<font color="yellow">How could a young man have breast cancer?</font>

521
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,400
<font color="yellow">He has to get married
and hold his wife to his chest.</font>

522
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,130
<font color="yellow">How can you put a
woman's bra on that chest?</font>

523
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,540
<font color="yellow">Since things have turned out this way...</font>

524
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,360
<font color="yellow">please do not let the cancer relapse.</font>

525
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,040
<font color="yellow">Please take care of my son
Hwa Shin's chest and protect it.</font>

526
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,200
<font color="yellow">If there is a nice girl with large
breasts who will hold him in her arms</font>

527
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,890
<font color="yellow">please bring them together.</font>

528
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,970
<font color="yellow"><i>I pray to you. I pray to you.</i></font>

529
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,190
<font color="yellow">There is a lot of fluid in there.
You must have been in pain.</font>

530
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,310
<font color="yellow">Men almost never get it.
This is very strange.</font>

531
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,330
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

532
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,440
<font color="yellow">Is there a problem?</font>

533
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,820
<font color="yellow">By any chance... have you been drinking?</font>

534
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,210
<font color="yellow">I told you not to exercise,
but it looks like you have.</font>

535
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,220
<font color="yellow">Your surgery wound
opened up quite a lot.</font>

536
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,500
<font color="yellow">Or did you get into a fight?</font>

537
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:52,170
<font color="yellow">Seeing the state you are in,
you probably ate food like pork belly.</font>

538
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,690
<font color="yellow">You had dairy, too.</font>

539
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,470
<font color="yellow">You decided to ignore your doctor
to see if I would win or you would win.</font>

540
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,350
<font color="yellow">- Is a room open?
- Yes, Doctor.</font>

541
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,240
<font color="yellow">- What?
- It's a seroma.</font>

542
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,120
<font color="yellow">You said it wasn't last time.</font>

543
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,740
<font color="yellow">How much did you drink, exactly?</font>

544
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,850
<font color="yellow">Also, why are you here alone today?</font>

545
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,960
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you here with Pyo Na Ri?
Did you two really break up?</font>

546
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,090
<font color="yellow">How can I be admitted again, Doctor?</font>

547
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,300
<font color="yellow">- There is a two person room.
- Wait a minute.</font>

548
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,840
<font color="yellow">You know I can't share a room
with another female patient.</font>

549
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,850
<font color="yellow">Who told you not to listen to
any of my warnings?</font>

550
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,380
<font color="yellow">You drank, fought, and didn't
come in for radiation treatment.</font>

551
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,260
<font color="yellow">You need to be admitted.</font>

552
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,570
<font color="yellow">If you haven't broken up,
tell Pyo Na Ri to come right now.</font>

553
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,700
<font color="yellow">I don't like it because
she treats me like a patient.</font>

554
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,460
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be treated
like a man by her from now on.</font>

555
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,290
<font color="yellow">Look at you.</font>

556
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,240
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with Reporter Um?</font>

557
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,580
<font color="yellow">Na Ri?</font>

558
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,730
<font color="yellow">Chief and Reporter Kye,
what brings you by?</font>

559
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,110
<font color="yellow">Can we use your bathroom?</font>

560
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,790
<font color="yellow">Ours is broken and the one
on the second floor is just guys.</font>

561
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,230
<font color="yellow">It seems weird to use the restaurant's.</font>

562
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course. It's over here.</font>

563
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,120
<font color="yellow">- You're making kimchi pancakes.
- Yes.</font>

564
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,980
<font color="yellow">The kids are studying on the second floor</font>

565
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,560
<font color="yellow">so I thought I would feed them some.</font>

566
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,580
<font color="yellow">Looks good.</font>

567
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,880
<font color="yellow">- Do you want some?
- Do you have soju?</font>

568
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,170
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

569
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,810
<font color="yellow">Reporter Kye, I'm enjoying you
on the 9 p.m. news.</font>

570
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,490
<font color="yellow">I'd like to learn how to be
charismatic like you.</font>

571
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,970
<font color="yellow">Suck up to me at work only, not here.</font>

572
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,610
<font color="yellow">- It's uncomfortable.
- Gosh, do it to me.</font>

573
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,810
<font color="yellow">Chief, you're getting
more and more beautiful.</font>

574
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,920
<font color="yellow">- How do you do it?
- What good is it?</font>

575
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,050
<font color="yellow">I'm not on video, only audio.
Plus, I just got canceled.</font>

576
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,570
<font color="yellow">- You did?
- Yes.</font>

577
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,150
<font color="yellow">- Here we go.
- Cheers.</font>

578
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,540
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

579
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,070
<font color="yellow">Who is it? Who do you like more?</font>

580
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,250
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me?
- Do you think we're stupid?</font>

581
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,350
<font color="yellow">They're friends, at that.</font>

582
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,680
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, Lee Hwa Shin said
"Sleep with me" to you.</font>

583
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,950
<font color="yellow">You knew... how did you?
You knew about it?</font>

584
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,270
<font color="yellow">How long has it been with President Go?</font>

585
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,880
<font color="yellow">He comes to drive you to
the station every morning.</font>

586
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,550
<font color="yellow">Decide quickly and
don't make them suffer so long.</font>

587
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,350
<font color="yellow">I just hate girls like that.</font>

588
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,830
<font color="yellow">You should clink glasses.</font>

589
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,530
<font color="yellow">They want me to date them both.</font>

590
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,960
<font color="yellow">- They said that?
- Really?</font>

591
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,460
<font color="yellow">So I said I would
break up with both of them.</font>

592
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,780
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I can't date them both.</font>

593
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,260
<font color="yellow">I can't do it.</font>

594
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,120
<font color="yellow">I'm breaking up with them.
I'm in the process of ending it.</font>

595
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,270
<font color="yellow">Wow...</font>

596
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,460
<font color="yellow">You should do it, Pyo Na Ri.</font>

597
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,700
<font color="yellow">- Are you crazy?
- When else will she get the chance?</font>

598
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,970
<font color="yellow">She will need to try going back
and forth in order to figure it out.</font>

599
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,280
<font color="yellow">Once she figures out who she likes more</font>

600
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,520
<font color="yellow">she won't want to
go back and forth at all.</font>

601
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,220
<font color="yellow">Yes, but I have a little brother
who is a senior right now.</font>

602
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,130
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to
get married and grow old.</font>

603
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,990
<font color="yellow">I'm getting a bad feeling that you'll
grow old while taking care of Chi Yeol.</font>

604
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,050
<font color="yellow">Chi Yeol wouldn't like that either.</font>

605
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,120
<font color="yellow">Don't run away or avoid it
and just do it, Pyo Na Ri.</font>

606
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,730
<font color="yellow">That's not right.</font>

607
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:21,490
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I've had two men
follow me around saying they liked me?</font>

608
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,490
<font color="yellow">Reporter Um and Lee Joong Shin?</font>

609
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,360
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

610
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,380
<font color="yellow">I only went after one.</font>

611
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,840
<font color="yellow">I ruined my own life,
but I have no regrets.</font>

612
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,140
<font color="yellow">If I had dated both men at that time,
my life would be even more twisted.</font>

613
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,110
<font color="yellow">Just choose one man.</font>

614
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,470
<font color="yellow">You are only supposed to love one man.</font>

615
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,800
<font color="yellow">Date them both, Pyo Na Ri.</font>

616
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,820
<font color="yellow">Those guys really like you.</font>

617
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,170
<font color="yellow">It's like they're on their knees begging.</font>

618
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,530
<font color="yellow">The men were the ones
who asked you to date them both.</font>

619
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,020
<font color="yellow">Date them both, love them,
and then make the decision.</font>

620
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,090
<font color="yellow">It's the best you can do for them.</font>

621
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,570
<font color="yellow">- No, no. I can't do it.
- You can do it.</font>

622
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,510
<font color="yellow">Just pick one.</font>

623
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,170
<font color="yellow">So, who is that one man?</font>

624
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,620
<font color="yellow">It has to be President Go.</font>

625
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,310
<font color="yellow">You need to dump Lee Hwa Shin.</font>

626
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,780
<font color="yellow">Yes. We think alike on that one.</font>

627
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,430
<font color="yellow">You will realize that once you
start dating our brother-in-law.</font>

628
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:16,420
<font color="yellow">You don't know the truth about men
until you live with them.</font>

629
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,290
<font color="yellow">What is Reporter Lee like?</font>

630
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,190
<font color="yellow">Oh no. It's okay.</font>

631
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,680
<font color="yellow">Are you going on a business trip?</font>

632
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,780
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Are you going on a business trip?</font>

633
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,010
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Then where are you going?</font>

634
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,580
<font color="yellow">On a vacation.</font>

635
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,490
<font color="yellow">Right. It is the weekend.</font>

636
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,500
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you want to go too?</font>

637
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,870
<font color="yellow">Should I?</font>

638
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,950
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

639
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,150
<font color="yellow">Why not live my life recklessly?</font>

640
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,430
<font color="yellow">It's all over if you go on
an overnight vacation with me.</font>

641
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,360
<font color="yellow">It's over with Jung Won
and you have to date me.</font>

642
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,920
<font color="yellow">- I know.
- Do you?</font>

643
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,080
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

644
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,530
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you...</font>

645
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,360
<font color="yellow">Next time.</font>

646
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,210
<font color="yellow">Let's go on an overnight trip.</font>

647
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,400
<font color="yellow">Let's go spend a night somewhere.</font>

648
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,100
<font color="yellow">Has she lost her mind?</font>

649
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,150
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

650
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,610
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

651
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,050
<font color="yellow">I'm going alone.</font>

652
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,340
<font color="yellow">What is this?
Are you going with another woman?</font>

653
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,500
<font color="yellow">Hey, what other woman do I have?</font>

654
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,890
<font color="yellow">How would I know?</font>

655
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,650
<font color="yellow">No, next time.</font>

656
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,290
<font color="yellow">What's a guy going on
vacation by himself for?</font>

657
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,510
<font color="yellow">It's very suspicious.</font>

658
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:59,830
<font color="yellow">I think you're even more suspicious.
Why are you suddenly like this?</font>

659
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:02,160
<font color="yellow">Suddenly? This isn't sudden.</font>

660
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,750
<font color="yellow">You have always been sexy, Reporter Lee.</font>

661
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,700
<font color="yellow">Since the moment I met you until now,
you've always been so manly to me.</font>

662
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:17,360
<font color="yellow">To me, you are still
the manliest of all men.</font>

663
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,360
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

664
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,410
<font color="yellow">Still, next time.</font>

665
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,750
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

666
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,610
<font color="yellow">Pft.</font>

667
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,650
<font color="yellow">He's an anchor.</font>

668
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,010
<font color="yellow"><i>You are receiving that love.</i></font>

669
00:42:54,010 --> 00:43:01,310
<font color="yellow"><i>You were born to be loved.</i></font>

670
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:10,770
<font color="yellow"><i>You have been receiving
that love in your life.</i></font>

671
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:17,690
<font color="yellow"><i>The love of God began with creation.</i></font>

672
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:25,870
<font color="yellow"><i>It has connected us
through our fellowship.</i></font>

673
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:32,710
<font color="yellow"><i>Because of your existence in the world</i></font>

674
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:39,230
<font color="yellow"><i>it brings us all so much joy.</i></font>

675
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,900
<font color="yellow">Are you mad because I'm here?</font>

676
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,110
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

677
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:48,890
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Leave.</font>

678
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:53,000
<font color="yellow">- Then, I'll leave.
- Where are you going?</font>

679
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,030
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

680
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:57,470
<font color="yellow">Give that to me.
Just let it go for one day.</font>

681
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,940
<font color="yellow">They don't recognize you.</font>

682
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,460
<font color="yellow">Close the curtain.</font>

683
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,450
<font color="yellow">Just for one day, Reporter Lee.</font>

684
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,080
<font color="yellow">Who are all those people?</font>

685
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:24,370
<font color="yellow">Oh, what are you doing here, Jung Won?</font>

686
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,250
<font color="yellow">- Have you been doing well, Uncle?
- Yes.</font>

687
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,190
<font color="yellow">Have you guys been okay?</font>

688
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,550
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

689
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,550
<font color="yellow">Do you have an extra room in your house?
Can I stay there?</font>

690
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,610
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

691
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,260
<font color="yellow">I like Pyo Na Ri. I want to be near her.</font>

692
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:45,920
<font color="yellow">How does my sister feel?</font>

693
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,260
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

694
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,850
<font color="yellow">I must not be good enough yet.</font>

695
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:53,960
<font color="yellow">I don't think I've
won her heart over yet.</font>

696
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:58,050
<font color="yellow">I want to impress her.</font>

697
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:00,860
<font color="yellow">Your sister keeps pushing me away.</font>

698
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,820
<font color="yellow">I need to impress you, too.</font>

699
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:05,880
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

700
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:11,280
<font color="yellow">Yes, a little brother
should be hard on me.</font>

701
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,580
<font color="yellow">Sorry, but why don't
you guys go eat outside?</font>

702
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,790
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

703
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,420
<font color="yellow">Doctor Geum called me
yesterday and told me.</font>

704
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,110
<font color="yellow">Are you hiding it from me too now?</font>

705
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,060
<font color="yellow">What were you going to do on your own?</font>

706
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,100
<font color="yellow">I guess you can go to
women's public baths too.</font>

707
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,870
<font color="yellow">So, Grandma. Should I scrub
and wash your back for you?</font>

708
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,480
<font color="yellow">Should I wash your back for you?
Let me see.</font>

709
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,220
<font color="yellow">- Does that feel good? Is it here?
- Hey, stop that.</font>

710
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,730
<font color="yellow">- I'll clean your back for you.
- Stop that!</font>

711
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:45,240
<font color="yellow">Here? Here?</font>

712
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,280
<font color="yellow">It tickles.</font>

713
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,390
<font color="yellow">Gosh! I knew this would happen
when I saw you drinking.</font>

714
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,230
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be treated like
a patient by you anymore, so go.</font>

715
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,680
<font color="yellow">So you still have your pride.
You're still a man, huh?</font>

716
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,240
<font color="yellow">I'm coming in now.</font>

717
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,850
<font color="yellow">Go inside and get changed
in the dressing room.</font>

718
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,590
<font color="yellow">You have the post-op bra, right?</font>

719
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,950
<font color="yellow">I have to use it again?</font>

720
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,210
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to use it.
- Did you bring it?</font>

721
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,580
<font color="yellow">Just go!</font>

722
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,750
<font color="yellow">He has to use it, right?</font>

723
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,840
<font color="yellow">Once we use the needle to
take out the fluid in his chest</font>

724
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,380
<font color="yellow">he needs the post-op bra
to put pressure on the chest.</font>

725
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,060
<font color="yellow">- Go on in.
- I won't do it.</font>

726
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,810
<font color="yellow">You have to do it this time.</font>

727
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,880
<font color="yellow">I will not do it.</font>

728
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,020
<font color="yellow">Right now, please.</font>

729
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,390
<font color="yellow">I'll go downstairs and
buy it myself, so just leave.</font>

730
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,850
<font color="yellow">I won't go in until you leave.</font>

731
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,320
<font color="yellow">Why would you buy it
when you have two already?</font>

732
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,150
<font color="yellow">I'll go to your place and bring them.</font>

733
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,550
<font color="yellow">I'll get them
while you're getting treated.</font>

734
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:53,800
<font color="yellow">Give me your keys.</font>

735
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,760
<font color="yellow">Are you going to keep acting
like my guardian? Just go.</font>

736
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,340
<font color="yellow">I heard Pyo Na Ri was in a one-sided
love with Reporter Lee for a long time.</font>

737
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:09,770
<font color="yellow">It seems like everyone knows
about that darn one-sided love.</font>

738
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,070
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I feel hurt.</font>

739
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,590
<font color="yellow">I'm also anxious because I feel like
she might like Hwa Shin more.</font>

740
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:20,630
<font color="yellow">I would lose to Hwa Shin
if he knew I felt like this, right?</font>

741
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:21,680
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

742
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,630
<font color="yellow">Don't get caught.</font>

743
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,640
<font color="yellow">Just show her who you really are.</font>

744
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,500
<font color="yellow">Not the image of you that your family
taught you to show to others.</font>

745
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,500
<font color="yellow">You caused lots of trouble in
junior high and high school in the US.</font>

746
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,720
<font color="yellow">You had lots of girlfriends too.</font>

747
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,340
<font color="yellow">You're much more charming up close,
rather than from afar.</font>

748
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,900
<font color="yellow">Though, everyone only sees you from afar.</font>

749
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,980
<font color="yellow">Come. I'll give you a room.</font>

750
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,030
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- You can do it, nephew.</font>

751
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,310
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

752
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, you, Jung Won... which one?</i></font>

753
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,410
<font color="yellow">Oh... Jung Won.</font>

754
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:16,220
<font color="yellow">Are you home?</font>

755
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,390
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

756
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,480
<font color="yellow"><i>Where are you then?</i></font>

757
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,680
<font color="yellow">I'm out right now.</font>

758
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,710
<font color="yellow">See me for a bit. Right now, I'm...</font>

759
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,210
<font color="yellow">Sorry, but today I'm a bit...</font>

760
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,580
<font color="yellow">Today, you're what?</font>

761
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,270
<font color="yellow">I think I'll be busy.</font>

762
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:43,750
<font color="yellow">I might be up all night at the station.</font>

763
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,650
<font color="yellow">I'll call you tomorrow.</font>

764
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,280
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

765
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:08,550
<font color="yellow">In the name of Jesus Christ
we pray, Amen.</font>

766
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,490
<font color="yellow"><i>How many times do I have to tell you?</i></font>

767
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,590
<font color="yellow"><i>The surgery went well
and his prognosis looks good.</i></font>

768
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:15,530
<font color="yellow"><i>If you have time to worry like this,
make sure your friend doesn't drink.</i></font>

769
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:17,870
<font color="yellow"><i>Please make sure he
doesn't get into fights, either.</i></font>

770
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,940
<font color="yellow">Go now.</font>

771
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:50,940
<font color="yellow">I said go.</font>

772
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,150
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at?
Don't look at me like that.</font>

773
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,900
<font color="yellow">Lee Hwa Shin, I'm here to
give you a shot of painkillers.</font>

774
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,580
<font color="yellow">- Can your friend pull your pants down?
- What?</font>

775
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,110
<font color="yellow">I'll do it myself.</font>

776
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:26,450
<font color="yellow">I told you that you
cannot use your arms today.</font>

777
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,380
<font color="yellow">Can your friend please help out?</font>

778
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,740
<font color="yellow">But still...</font>

779
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,440
<font color="yellow">Hurry, please.</font>

780
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:42,830
<font color="yellow">More.</font>

781
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,080
<font color="yellow">It will sting.</font>

782
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,560
<font color="yellow">If you move your arms today,
the fluid will build up again.</font>

783
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,380
<font color="yellow">You could get an infection.</font>

784
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,440
<font color="yellow">You could lift your arms in your sleep</font>

785
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,970
<font color="yellow">so it might be better
to stay up all night.</font>

786
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:02,540
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

787
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,920
<font color="yellow">We can also tie your arms up.</font>

788
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,130
<font color="yellow">What did you say? What?</font>

789
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:10,680
<font color="yellow">It was a shot into the muscle so
you have to massage it for a long time.</font>

790
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,410
<font color="yellow">Like this.</font>

791
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:16,300
<font color="yellow">I'll be back to take your blood pressure.</font>

792
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:31,090
<font color="yellow"><i>You know how the test started
20 minutes late that day?</i></font>

793
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:33,440
<font color="yellow">He was worried you
wouldn't be able to make it.</font>

794
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,600
<font color="yellow">President Go created a traffic jam using
multiple cars to make his mother late.</font>

795
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,740
<font color="yellow">You know what kind of person he is,
and he did something like that for you.</font>

796
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,680
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you thank him?</font>

797
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,960
<font color="yellow">He didn't even tell me.</font>

798
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,850
<font color="yellow">- That's enough.
- She said massage it for a long time.</font>

799
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:03,700
<font color="yellow">It would've been nice to do this earlier.</font>

800
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,280
<font color="yellow">I would have been cold about it
even if you had breast cancer.</font>

801
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,710
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have given up Pyo Na Ri
over something like that.</font>

802
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:12,690
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't.</font>

803
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:16,130
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to either.</font>

804
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:21,570
<font color="yellow">Stop now!</font>

805
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:35,020
<font color="yellow">You don't listen...</font>

806
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:45,840
<font color="yellow">You two must have made up.</font>

807
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,930
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

808
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:48,540
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

809
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,300
<font color="yellow">I'll be heading home now.</font>

810
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,310
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going?
- Your friend is here now.</font>

811
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:59,230
<font color="yellow">I don't need to be here.</font>

812
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,520
<font color="yellow">He's is more considerate and
better at taking care of you.</font>

813
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,260
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

814
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,090
<font color="yellow">- You told me to go.
- Don't go.</font>

815
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,050
<font color="yellow">Let's all stay here.</font>

816
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,290
<font color="yellow">You go.</font>

817
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:31,050
<font color="yellow">I said I would sleep there.</font>

818
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:34,350
<font color="yellow">You're too tall, Jung Won. This is short.</font>

819
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,410
<font color="yellow">- I can't sleep.
- Me neither.</font>

820
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,170
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Lee.
- Call me Hwa Shin.</font>

821
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,180
<font color="yellow">Jung Won.</font>

822
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,770
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

823
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:52,210
<font color="yellow">I like it that the three of us
are here together.</font>

824
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:53,770
<font color="yellow">Do you two not like it?</font>

825
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:57,850
<font color="yellow">It's not so great.</font>

826
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,430
<font color="yellow">- What about you?
- I don't like it.</font>

827
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:02,030
<font color="yellow">You just want to be with me?</font>

828
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:03,050
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Yes.</font>

829
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,150
<font color="yellow">Then should I be honest right now
about how I really feel?</font>

830
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,450
<font color="yellow">Can I say it?</font>

831
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:15,340
<font color="yellow">- Talk.
- Say it quickly.</font>

832
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:26,090
<font color="yellow">Should the three of us
just live together like this?</font>

833
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,800
<font color="yellow">Let's not bother with me
dating both of you.</font>

834
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:35,640
<font color="yellow">Let's just all live together instead.</font>

835
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:40,470
<font color="yellow">We don't need to
date separately and have meals.</font>

836
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:44,690
<font color="yellow">We can all watch TV, eat fruit,
and drink coffee together.</font>

837
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:47,330
<font color="yellow">Then we can all go to
work together in the morning.</font>

838
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:53,490
<font color="yellow">I can't live together if it's just two,
but I could do it if it's three of us.</font>

839
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,700
<font color="yellow">We need to live together
to really get to know one another.</font>

840
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,470
<font color="yellow">Dating is really only
getting to know half the person.</font>

841
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:03,410
<font color="yellow">We can poo and smell each other's poo.</font>

842
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,930
<font color="yellow">You have to live together
and bother each other a bit.</font>

843
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,240
<font color="yellow">That way, you really know one another.</font>

844
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,670
<font color="yellow">Then I can really figure out
which person is the answer.</font>

845
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:17,820
<font color="yellow">If we really live together,
you two may end up not liking me.</font>

846
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:23,270
<font color="yellow">You may end up losing feelings for me
after living together for a month.</font>

847
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:25,770
<font color="yellow">You have to live together
in order to really fight too.</font>

848
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:29,020
<font color="yellow">You don't get into proper fights
when you're dating.</font>

849
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:32,350
<font color="yellow">If one month isn't enough,
then we could do two months.</font>

850
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:37,730
<font color="yellow">Well, one person could end up
disliking me and pack up to leave.</font>

851
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:40,280
<font color="yellow">Or I could end up leaving.</font>

852
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,260
<font color="yellow">I might end up being
disappointed in both of you.</font>

853
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,930
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

854
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:52,960
<font color="yellow">You don't have to if you don't want to.</font>

855
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,930
<font color="yellow">I just thought it might be better
if we were all together.</font>

856
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,120
<font color="yellow">Gosh, forget it.</font>

857
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,860
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

862
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,790
<font color="yellow">It is too late, but I apologize.</font>

863
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:05,440
<font color="yellow">I apologize for calling
Anchor Pyo an easy woman.</font>

864
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,710
<font color="yellow">I don't like easy girls like you.</font>

865
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,530
<font color="yellow"><i>[APOLOGIZING TOO LATE]
I will repay her by being an easy man.</i></font>

866
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:15,100
<font color="yellow">When Anchor Pyo touched my chest in
Thailand, my heart was already yours.</font>

867
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,960
<font color="yellow">Truthfully, I was very nervous then.</font>

868
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,110
<font color="yellow">I pretended not to know that she was in
love with me before I left for Thailand.</font>

869
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,110
<font color="yellow">I was wrong.</font>

870
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:24,300
<font color="yellow">I knew how Anchor Pyo felt
and played with her heart.</font>

871
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,430
<font color="yellow">I am reflecting on what I have done.</font>

872
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:28,170
<font color="yellow">Let's look at the video.</font>

873
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:33,530
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't do it. Kiss another guy.</i></font>

874
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:36,340
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I really wanted to kiss her.</font>

875
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,900
<font color="yellow">No one knows how much my heart
was racing when I looked at her lips.</font>

876
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,050
<font color="yellow">From now on...</font>

877
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,640
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

878
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:46,650
<font color="yellow">I hope I get many more opportunities.</font>

879
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,710
<font color="yellow">That will be all for today.</font>
