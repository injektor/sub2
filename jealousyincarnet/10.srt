00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,639
<font color="yellow">It was hard today, right?</font>

3
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:14,909
<font color="yellow">It was hard because of the article, because of me.</font>

4
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,139
<font color="yellow">No...</font>

5
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:19,941
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

6
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:22,911
<font color="yellow">A little.</font>

7
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:26,741
<font color="yellow">You didn't look like it was a little hard when you got out.</font>

8
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,241
<font color="yellow">It was a little hard.</font>

9
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:31,611
<font color="yellow">Your look said, "It was very hard."</font>

10
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:34,711
<font color="yellow">Do you know how relieved I was when I saw that?</font>

11
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,571
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming to me.</font>

12
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:44,971
<font color="yellow">I didn't know I'd come here twice today.</font>

13
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:49,271
<font color="yellow">The first time, you came to return the dress and get mad at me,</font>

14
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:53,011
<font color="yellow">and the second time, you came because you wanted to see me, right?</font>

15
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,541
<font color="yellow">No?</font>

16
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,341
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee brought me.</font>

17
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:06,241
<font color="yellow">You didn't want to come at all,</font>

18
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:09,011
<font color="yellow">but you were forced to come because of Hwa Shin?</font>

19
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:15,711
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have had the courage to come if it weren't for him.</font>

20
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:17,141
<font color="yellow">That's what I thought.</font>

21
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:20,111
<font color="yellow">We should be good to Hwa Shin.</font>

22
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:22,471
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

23
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:27,141
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

24
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:30,071
<font color="yellow">where is he?</font>

25
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:34,841
<font color="yellow">He must be in his car.</font>

26
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,081
<font color="yellow">What time is it?</font>

27
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:06,941
<font color="yellow">Where did he go instead of going to the hospital?</font>

28
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:09,871
<font color="yellow">He could go with me now.</font>

29
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:04,571
<font color="yellow">I didn't get to give this to you at the funeral.</font>

30
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:09,171
<font color="yellow">- I got this for you from Paris. - What is it?</font>

31
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:10,941
<font color="yellow">For guys. You know.</font>

32
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:13,441
<font color="yellow">It's good for the bedroom at night.</font>

33
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:16,371
<font color="yellow">Paris has a lot of impotent men like you, apparently.</font>

34
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:22,941
<font color="yellow">- Tae Ra. - Put it away.</font>

35
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:25,641
<font color="yellow">How could you be impotent at your age?</font>

36
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:27,471
<font color="yellow">It's so embarrassing.</font>

37
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:29,841
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to get married? Aren't you going to have kids?</font>

38
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:31,571
<font color="yellow">My goal this year...</font>

39
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,111
<font color="yellow">is to make you have kids before marrying Jung Won off.</font>

40
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:37,641
<font color="yellow">I'm busy. If you're not helping me with the dishes, just leave.</font>

41
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:38,941
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

42
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,011
<font color="yellow">With our family background, your looks and education,</font>

43
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:44,471
<font color="yellow">what do you lack that you need to rot...</font>

44
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:46,911
<font color="yellow">in this shabby town, making stupid noodles?</font>

45
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:51,171
<font color="yellow">You were doing all the kitchen work during the funeral.</font>

46
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:54,211
<font color="yellow">It's because you live like family in this villa,</font>

47
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,411
<font color="yellow">that you don't want to sleep with women.</font>

48
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:57,641
<font color="yellow">Tae Ra!</font>

49
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:01,241
<font color="yellow">You yell only at me.</font>

50
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:02,971
<font color="yellow">You're so nice to everyone else.</font>

51
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:04,171
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

52
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,381
<font color="yellow">The doctor said...</font>

53
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:11,641
<font color="yellow">I'm being punished for dating women too readily,</font>

54
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:13,611
<font color="yellow">sleeping with them too readily...</font>

55
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,811
<font color="yellow">and breaking up with them too readily.</font>

56
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:17,841
<font color="yellow">Leave me alone.</font>

57
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:20,211
<font color="yellow">I have no desire to even touch women...</font>

58
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:22,841
<font color="yellow">or kiss them. How could I make it to the bed?</font>

59
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:26,541
<font color="yellow">Don't come back to the villa again.</font>

60
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,141
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Also,</font>

61
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:29,471
<font color="yellow">don't look down on the people here.</font>

62
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,111
<font color="yellow">You said they can't even pay rent on time.</font>

63
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:32,241
<font color="yellow">I said to leave!</font>

64
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:34,171
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

65
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:37,541
<font color="yellow">The medicine your doctor gives you don't work anyway.</font>

66
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,881
<font color="yellow">I know my own illness.</font>

67
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,141
<font color="yellow">They said it's psychological, not physical.</font>

68
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:42,771
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

69
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:47,341
<font color="yellow">I was sitting on the steps of some street in Paris,</font>

70
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:49,771
<font color="yellow">and Madam De Pont was selling this.</font>

71
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,671
<font color="yellow">See? It says right here.</font>

72
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:57,041
<font color="yellow">It means...</font>

73
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:00,411
<font color="yellow">she awaits for her husband's return.</font>

74
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:04,211
<font color="yellow">It's supposed to be more effective than ton dieu, pelle la magique...</font>

75
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:05,971
<font color="yellow">or haute porte ennuience.</font>

76
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:09,471
<font color="yellow">Haute porte... Nonsense.</font>

77
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,911
<font color="yellow">It has a side effect of making you wink a lot,</font>

78
00:06:12,911 --> 00:06:13,971
<font color="yellow">but who cares?</font>

79
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,711
<font color="yellow">If you see that happen, it means it's working.</font>

80
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,071
<font color="yellow">It's the latest.</font>

81
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:24,871
<font color="yellow">Even if a woman is naked, I'm just not interested.</font>

82
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:26,841
<font color="yellow">- Do you want some water? - Get out.</font>

83
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,741
<font color="yellow">Do you remember the shocking story...</font>

84
00:06:38,911 --> 00:06:42,641
<font color="yellow">of a five-year-old girl escaping barefoot from her step-mum?</font>

85
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:46,871
<font color="yellow">When you hear the term "family", you think of blood relations,</font>

86
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,841
<font color="yellow">- but in reality, - Just this year alone,</font>

87
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,211
<font color="yellow">- people you have breakfast with... - there have been 15,000 cases...</font>

88
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:55,711
<font color="yellow">- of child abuse this year. - and greet you at home...</font>

89
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:59,341
<font color="yellow">- We need a solution. - may be the true family.</font>

90
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:04,141
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

91
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:26,311
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

92
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:32,211
<font color="yellow">Do you want to date me?</font>

93
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:33,741
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

94
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:35,811
<font color="yellow">What's his problem?</font>

95
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:39,241
<font color="yellow">He's wasted. What's his problem?</font>

96
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:55,811
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

97
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,741
<font color="yellow">Date me.</font>

98
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:03,441
<font color="yellow">What is he saying? He must have lost his mind.</font>

99
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:05,141
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee, what's wrong?</font>

100
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,911
<font color="yellow">- Please move out of the way. - Excuse me.</font>

101
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,441
<font color="yellow">I like you.</font>

102
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:32,341
<font color="yellow">Do you want to date me?</font>

103
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:34,741
<font color="yellow">I'm charming.</font>

104
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:37,341
<font color="yellow">It's hard to refuse, right?</font>

105
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:39,471
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's date.</font>

106
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,111
<font color="yellow">I'm your sister-in-law.</font>

107
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:57,571
<font color="yellow">There has been a recent riot of people nervous about...</font>

108
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,011
<font color="yellow">Do you want to date me?</font>

109
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:49,811
<font color="yellow">In exchange for the coffee.</font>

110
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:53,481
<font color="yellow">Do you have time for this with the anchor audition coming up?</font>

111
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:55,341
<font color="yellow">Date me.</font>

112
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:58,481
<font color="yellow">Don't you want the nine o'clock news? Did you give up?</font>

113
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:03,481
<font color="yellow">Prepare for the audition with me.</font>

114
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:07,141
<font color="yellow">You know it hurts if the team chemistry score is low,</font>

115
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:08,511
<font color="yellow">even if the individual score is high.</font>

116
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:10,171
<font color="yellow">You don't want to date me?</font>

117
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,741
<font color="yellow">Do you even know who I am?</font>

118
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:13,741
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

119
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:26,550
<font color="yellow">You stupid moron.</font>

120
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:28,981
<font color="yellow">Snap out of it, punk.</font>

121
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:32,011
<font color="yellow">If you're drunk, go home and sleep, you idiot.</font>

122
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:33,211
<font color="yellow">How dare you...</font>

123
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:36,141
<font color="yellow">come to the sacred newsroom and yap about dating?</font>

124
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:38,741
<font color="yellow">You're going to blame it on the alcohol in the morning...</font>

125
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:40,211
<font color="yellow">and pretend you don't remember, right?</font>

126
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:43,111
<font color="yellow">And this is the newsroom, where you conceited reporters...</font>

127
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:46,041
<font color="yellow">claim only the truth may be spoken, you scum bucket!</font>

128
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,011
<font color="yellow">You're good.</font>

129
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,071
<font color="yellow">You curse really well.</font>

130
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:32,911
<font color="yellow">It was crazy today because of the article, wasn't it?</font>

131
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:33,911
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

132
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,141
<font color="yellow">I can't marry you.</font>

133
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:39,741
<font color="yellow">Let us each marry someone that we like.</font>

134
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,841
<font color="yellow">Do you like someone?</font>

135
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:43,741
<font color="yellow">Don't you like anyone?</font>

136
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:46,011
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

137
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:47,511
<font color="yellow">Do you like someone?</font>

138
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:50,571
<font color="yellow">I like Pyo Na Ri.</font>

139
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,811
<font color="yellow">The weather forecaster? That Pyo Na Ri?</font>

140
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:57,511
<font color="yellow">Since when?</font>

141
00:11:57,511 --> 00:12:01,441
<font color="yellow">Did you go on the blind date with me although you liked someone?</font>

142
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:02,941
<font color="yellow">I first met Na Ri...</font>

143
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:04,471
<font color="yellow">after our blind date.</font>

144
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:08,441
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to both of our parents...</font>

145
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:09,741
<font color="yellow">and take the blame.</font>

146
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:12,141
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

147
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:16,371
<font color="yellow">The parents did rush it when we never even went on a date,</font>

148
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:18,311
<font color="yellow">but I didn't mind.</font>

149
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,211
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

150
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:22,911
<font color="yellow">I'll tell my parents.</font>

151
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,871
<font color="yellow">- I'm glad you get me. - Exactly.</font>

152
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:27,771
<font color="yellow">We get each other well.</font>

153
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:31,541
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Sure.</font>

154
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:43,971
<font color="yellow">(Applicant)</font>

155
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,741

<font color="yellow">is 234.</font>

157
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:56,641
<font color="yellow">Where should I shoot my introduction video?</font>

158
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,711
<font color="yellow">Did he go to the hospital or not?</font>

159
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:05,771
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

160
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:10,971
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee...</font>

161
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:15,311
<font color="yellow">Thank you for taking me earlier.</font>

162
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:19,511
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

163
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:29,671
<font color="yellow">I'm going to lose my mind.</font>

164
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:30,971
<font color="yellow">Are you insane?</font>

165
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:34,941
<font color="yellow">I told you it's dangerous, even if it's stage one.</font>

166

<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

167
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:39,671
<font color="yellow">Are you determined to get sick?</font>

168
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:41,911
<font color="yellow">Did you decide not to listen?</font>

169
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:45,071
<font color="yellow">You don't go to the hospital, but you drink instead?</font>

170
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:46,911
<font color="yellow">Why are you upsetting me so much?</font>

171
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:53,571
<font color="yellow">She says I'm upsetting her.</font>

172
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:55,241
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

173
00:13:58,341 --> 00:13:59,941
<font color="yellow">Are you upset because of me?</font>

174
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:02,841
<font color="yellow">Do you know how long Jung Won and I looked for you earlier?</font>

175
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:06,841
<font color="yellow">You only look for me when I upset you.</font>

176
00:14:06,841 --> 00:14:07,911
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

177
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:14,811
<font color="yellow">You drank a lot.</font>

178
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:16,241
<font color="yellow">You're insane.</font>

179
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,111
<font color="yellow">Just how much did you drink?</font>

180
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,911
<font color="yellow">Do you want to date me?</font>

181
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:34,341
<font color="yellow">Aren't we dating already?</font>

182
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:38,111
<font color="yellow">That's what people are saying anyway.</font>

183
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:46,241
<font color="yellow">This is incredible.</font>

184
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:48,711
<font color="yellow">How do you enunciate so well even when you're drunk?</font>

185
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:52,711
<font color="yellow">It's amazing. Is that why your pronunciation is so good?</font>

186
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:54,641
<font color="yellow">Do you want to date me?</font>

187
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:00,841
<font color="yellow">I'm dating Jung Won.</font>

188
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:02,911
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make it work with him.</font>

189
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:06,311
<font color="yellow">I know you're drunk, but how could you say that?</font>

190
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:09,111
<font color="yellow">There are things you shouldn't say. Don't you agree?</font>

191
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,371
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever you want. Date me.</font>

192
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:18,871
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

193
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,411
<font color="yellow">You used to hate it when I even looked at you.</font>

194
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:32,741
<font color="yellow">Really? Anything?</font>

195
00:15:32,741 --> 00:15:33,811
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

196
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:36,571
<font color="yellow">Anything you want.</font>

197
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:45,611
<font color="yellow">Sing for me. "Wrongful Meeting".</font>

198
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:50,911
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

199
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:55,541
<font color="yellow">I didn't hear you sing it last time because I went to throw up.</font>

200
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,871
<font color="yellow">I want to hear it.</font>

201
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:57,941
<font color="yellow">Not that.</font>

202
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:01,841
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Forget it.</font>

203
00:16:01,841 --> 00:16:03,411
<font color="yellow">Anything, my foot.</font>

204
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:11,611
<font color="yellow">When will I understand love</font>

205
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:15,041
<font color="yellow">When will I understand life</font>

206
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,571
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Not that. "Wrongful Meeting".</font>

207
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:20,611
<font color="yellow">How long must I live to understand</font>

208
00:16:20,611 --> 00:16:23,411
<font color="yellow">Will that day ever come</font>

209
00:16:23,411 --> 00:16:24,971
<font color="yellow">You said you'd do anything.</font>

210
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:31,941
<font color="yellow">I cried, saying it couldn't be</font>

211
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:38,541
<font color="yellow">Because I had to give up both my love and my friendship</font>

212
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,541
<font color="yellow">Dance!</font>

213
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:46,341
<font color="yellow">My other friend patted me on the shoulder</font>

214
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:49,471
<font color="yellow">- And told me to forget - Oh my gosh.</font>

215

217
00:16:59,671 --> 00:17:03,711
<font color="yellow">That in itself is meaningful</font>

218
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:05,611
<font color="yellow">You can't rap, can you?</font>

219
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,441
<font color="yellow">My name is Lee Hwa Shin</font>

223
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,441

<font color="yellow">It's your speciality.</font>

246

00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:43,011
<font color="yellow">Act... Act like your mum?</font>

310
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:45,371
<font color="yellow">Ppal Gang, don't talk to your mums that way.</font>

311
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:46,541
<font color="yellow">You stay out of it.</font>

312
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:49,841
<font color="yellow">Why do you talk like that?</font>

313
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,511
<font color="yellow">Is that what your dad taught you? Is that how your dad raised you?</font>

314
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:56,111
<font color="yellow">Your dad may have left you to do anything as you pleased,</font>

315
00:23:56,111 --> 00:23:58,511
<font color="yellow">but I won't. Look at your nails.</font>

316
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:00,241
<font color="yellow">Those aren't the nails of a high school senior.</font>

317
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:04,611
<font color="yellow">Why are they so long? And they're painted, too.</font>

318
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,671
<font color="yellow">You brat. Clip them right now.</font>

319
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:10,411
<font color="yellow">How dare you women tell me what to do about my nails?</font>

320
00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:12,911
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting like my mums when you're not?</font>

321
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:18,041
<font color="yellow">What? Say that again.</font>

322
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:20,341
<font color="yellow">I'm not your mum...</font>

323
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:22,311
<font color="yellow">but I'm acting like a mum?</font>

324
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:26,071
<font color="yellow">Hey. How dare you slap my daughter?</font>

325
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:28,071
<font color="yellow">She's my precious daughter.</font>

326
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:29,641
<font color="yellow">She won't learn any manners otherwise.</font>

327
00:24:29,641 --> 00:24:31,541
<font color="yellow">Saying "yes" to everything doesn't make you a mum.</font>

328
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,741
<font color="yellow">Do you know how Dad treated me even though he had no money?</font>

329
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:39,971
<font color="yellow">I never once watched Na Ri do the weather.</font>

330
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:43,911
<font color="yellow">If it rained, Dad waited for me at the school with an umbrella.</font>

331
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:45,611
<font color="yellow">If it was cold, he waited there with a jacket.</font>

332
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:47,611
<font color="yellow">If it snowed, he waited there with roasted sweet potatoes.</font>

333
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:50,711
<font color="yellow">And I never once clipped my own nails.</font>

334
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:53,611
<font color="yellow">Dad always clipped them for me before they got long.</font>

335
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:58,311
<font color="yellow">I haven't been able to clip my nails once since Dad passed away,</font>

336
00:24:58,311 --> 00:25:01,141
<font color="yellow">because I feel like Dad will clip them for me again. But...</font>

337
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:03,171
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

338
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,471
<font color="yellow">who are you to tell me to clip my nails?</font>

339
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:09,071
<font color="yellow">When he apologised that those things were...</font>

340
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:12,871
<font color="yellow">all he could do for me because we had no money, where were you?</font>

341
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:18,411
<font color="yellow">You never once made me lunch. Why should I call you my mum?</font>

342
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:28,571
<font color="yellow">She'll be late for school.</font>

343
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:31,411
<font color="yellow">Ppal Gang, let's go. Let's go.</font>

347
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:26,241

<font color="yellow">"When did I do that?"</font>

350
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:38,241
<font color="yellow">See? Look at that.</font>

351
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,641
<font color="yellow">Don't follow me.</font>

352
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:50,241

413
00:32:02,911 --> 00:32:04,441

00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:13,941
<font color="yellow">You know not to believe what girls like that say, right?</font>

417
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:20,371
<font color="yellow">Why is being wrong about the weather the forecaster's fault?</font>

418
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,671

00:33:20,471 --> 00:33:22,371
<font color="yellow">I want you to be happy.</font>

435

<font color="yellow">They have more than enough money.</font>

442
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:51,311
<font color="yellow">She's obviously not after your money.</font>

443
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:53,641
<font color="yellow">She just likes you for you.</font>

444
00:33:53,641 --> 00:33:55,641
<font color="yellow">She's sincere and innocent.</font>

445
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:57,841
<font color="yellow">Did Soo Jung say she likes me?</font>

446
00:33:57,841 --> 00:33:59,511
<font color="yellow">I just had brunch with her.</font>

447
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,511

455
00:34:27,971 --> 00:34:29,641
<font color="yellow">That jerk!</font>

456
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:32,341
<font color="yellow">How could you take that wench's side even if I become a divorcee?</font>

457

<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

458
00:34:36,971 --> 00:34:39,371

00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:33,141
<font color="yellow">She really isn't his type.</font>

617
00:44:33,141 --> 00:44:34,511
<font color="yellow">What's his type?</font>

618
00:44:34,511 --> 00:44:35,611
<font color="yellow">Similar to mine.</font>

619
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:37,211
<font color="yellow">I doubt that.</font>

620
00:44:37,811 --> 00:44:39,871
<font color="yellow">He doesn't like women like me.</font>

621
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:43,971
<font color="yellow">That's because you don't know.</font>

622
00:44:43,971 --> 00:44:45,411
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin likes you.</font>

623
00:44:45,411 --> 00:44:47,111
<font color="yellow">That's why he set us up.</font>

624
00:44:47,111 --> 00:44:49,071
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't have done that if he didn't like you.</font>

625
00:44:49,071 --> 00:44:50,471
<font color="yellow">We're really good friends.</font>

626
00:45:04,511 --> 00:45:07,011
<font color="yellow">You and Soo Jung were made a fool of.</font>

627
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:13,211
<font color="yellow">You look so cute like this.</font>

628
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:14,611
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

629
00:45:16,971 --> 00:45:18,041
<font color="yellow">Sweetie.</font>

630
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:22,541
<font color="yellow">What should we eat? Why do you eat noodles?</font>

631
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:25,371
<font color="yellow">You don't eat well or sleep well.</font>

632
00:45:25,371 --> 00:45:27,611
<font color="yellow">And you just got out of the hospital.</font>

633
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:34,971
<font color="yellow">We'll have to eat something tastier than Hwa Shin is.</font>

634
00:45:35,571 --> 00:45:36,811
<font color="yellow">We should, Mr Ko.</font>

635
00:45:37,971 --> 00:45:39,071
<font color="yellow">Mr Ko?</font>

636
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:41,471
<font color="yellow">"Mr Ko" sounds weird.</font>

637
00:45:59,441 --> 00:46:01,071
<font color="yellow">I wonder what they're eating.</font>

638
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:13,441
<font color="yellow">This is too heavy.</font>

639
00:46:18,971 --> 00:46:20,011
<font color="yellow">I'll take that.</font>

640
00:46:21,141 --> 00:46:22,211
<font color="yellow">What did you get?</font>

641
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,071
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

642
00:46:24,471 --> 00:46:26,311
<font color="yellow">I wanted to cook for Ppal Gang.</font>

643
00:46:26,741 --> 00:46:28,911
<font color="yellow">- Thank you, Chef. - Not at all.</font>

644
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:38,311
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

645
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:01,971
<font color="yellow">How did he hold it back all this time?</font>

646
00:47:03,611 --> 00:47:04,641
<font color="yellow">That means...</font>

647
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:08,341
<font color="yellow">nothing happened with Ja Young, right?</font>

648
00:47:11,471 --> 00:47:12,511
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

649
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:16,511
<font color="yellow">That scared me.</font>

650
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:18,941
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

651
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:28,411
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

652
00:47:29,971 --> 00:47:31,211
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:36,111

655
00:47:36,111 --> 00:47:39,441
<font color="yellow">Dear Daughters-in-law, I made 1,000 octopus dumplings,</font>

656
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:40,741

657
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:41,871
<font color="yellow">So yummy.</font>

658
00:47:41,871 --> 00:47:45,671
<font color="yellow">If any go into your mouths, I'll cut you with a knife.</font>

659
00:47:48,211 --> 00:47:50,571
<font color="yellow">I listen to your show all the time.</font>

674
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:40,411

676
00:48:42,341 --> 00:48:44,571
<font color="yellow">What? I thought you were going to be Ppal Gang's mum.</font>

677
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:46,841
<font color="yellow">Being a mum isn't a big deal.</font>

<font color="yellow">I can be one if I want.</font>

679
00:48:49,341 --> 00:48:50,411

680
00:48:52,141 --> 00:48:53,571

<font color="yellow">Ppal Gang's coming. Ppal Gang!</font>

682
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:11,241

684
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:14,841

689
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:31,141

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

707
00:50:56,111 --> 00:50:57,441
<font color="yellow">Get home safely.</font>

708
00:50:57,811 --> 00:51:00,411
<font color="yellow">You don't have the basics of someone dating.</font>

709

<font color="yellow">you act like my personal assistant.</font>

712
00:51:08,771 --> 00:51:10,571
<font color="yellow">But you are a boss.</font>

713
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:11,911
<font color="yellow">Stop that.</font>

714
00:51:12,941 --> 00:51:14,611
<font color="yellow">"Mr Ko" is more comfortable.</font>

715
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:15,811
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

716
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:19,571
<font color="yellow">Am I supposed to date, treating you like my assistant?</font>

717
00:51:19,771 --> 00:51:21,811
<font color="yellow">Must I date as if I'm with Mr Cha?</font>

718
00:51:24,241 --> 00:51:28,711
<font color="yellow">I... I haven't dated much.</font>

719
00:51:29,011 --> 00:51:30,711
<font color="yellow">And you've been an assistant?</font>

720
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:34,071
<font color="yellow">No. I don't know much about that, either.</font>

721
00:51:35,171 --> 00:51:37,471
<font color="yellow">I'm just trying to look good.</font>

722
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:40,011
<font color="yellow">Look at this girl.</font>

723
00:51:40,211 --> 00:51:42,011
<font color="yellow">Look favourably on me.</font>

724
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:43,841
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

725
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:46,011
<font color="yellow">I'm the one that needs to look good.</font>

726
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:48,611
<font color="yellow">Why would you need to look good? What's looking good?</font>

727
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:50,771
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'd like it if you call me "Mr Ko"?</font>

728
00:51:53,941 --> 00:51:55,371
<font color="yellow">I don't know, to be honest.</font>

729
00:51:55,841 --> 00:51:57,111
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything.</font>

730

731
00:52:01,111 --> 00:52:04,511
<font color="yellow">just do as I say. Exactly as I say.</font>

732
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:07,711
<font color="yellow">- What? - Everything. Whatever. Anything.</font>

733
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:13,011
<font color="yellow">What? Are you scared? Tough.</font>

734
00:52:15,711 --> 00:52:19,041
<font color="yellow">I won't ask what you want to do or eat or where you want to go.</font>

735
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:21,571
<font color="yellow">What did you say all night long?</font>

736
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:24,711
<font color="yellow">"Anything is good. I like everything. That's fine."</font>

737
00:52:24,711 --> 00:52:27,071
<font color="yellow">"Yes. Of course."</font>

738
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,571
<font color="yellow">"Thank you. Thank you for dinner." Right?</font>

739
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:35,241
<font color="yellow">I didn't take you to be so clueless. What's wrong with you?</font>

740
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:39,841
<font color="yellow">I was nervous.</font>

741
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:43,471
<font color="yellow">I'm the man who wants to love you.</font>

742
00:52:43,711 --> 00:52:46,971
<font color="yellow">Don't turn me into a man who makes women uncomfortable.</font>

743
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:49,941
<font color="yellow">I don't know when I last received love.</font>

744
00:52:50,371 --> 00:52:53,211
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's because I'm not used to being loved.</font>

745
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:56,241
<font color="yellow">You don't seem to be used to giving love, either, Ms Pyo.</font>

746
00:52:56,371 --> 00:52:57,841
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

747
00:52:59,011 --> 00:53:00,111
<font color="yellow">Is it frustrating, Sir?</font>

748
00:53:00,171 --> 00:53:01,811
<font color="yellow">Sir? What? Sir?</font>

749
00:53:02,671 --> 00:53:03,871
<font color="yellow">Stop being so formal.</font>

750
00:53:04,811 --> 00:53:06,711
<font color="yellow">- Is it frustrating, Sir? - Again?</font>

751
00:53:07,171 --> 00:53:08,671
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

752
00:53:08,671 --> 00:53:09,811
<font color="yellow">Is it, Sir?</font>

753
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:12,641
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you are so frustrating.</font>

754
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:14,371
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

755
00:53:19,611 --> 00:53:23,471
<font color="yellow">Am I... Am I being dumped already?</font>

756
00:53:24,571 --> 00:53:26,641
<font color="yellow">This girl...</font>

757
00:53:29,811 --> 00:53:30,911
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

758
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:56,871
<font color="yellow">You're bold.</font>

759
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,411
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

760
00:54:30,311 --> 00:54:31,941
<font color="yellow">That's Hwa Shin's car.</font>

761
00:54:39,811 --> 00:54:41,741
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring me here?</font>

762
00:54:49,571 --> 00:54:50,711
<font color="yellow">Lend me money.</font>

763
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:53,811
<font color="yellow">How much?</font>

764
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:55,341
<font color="yellow">10,000 dollars.</font>

765
00:54:56,471 --> 00:54:59,141
<font color="yellow">Did you ask me to date you to borrow money?</font>

766
00:55:01,671 --> 00:55:03,471
<font color="yellow">You're becoming too pathetic.</font>

767
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:05,241
<font color="yellow">Forget it, if you don't want to.</font>

768
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:07,811
<font color="yellow">Will you date me even if I don't lend you the money?</font>

769
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:10,211
<font color="yellow">I won't date you even if you lend me the money.</font>

770
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:50,111
<font color="yellow">Don't be stupid and tell Na Ri...</font>

771
00:55:50,311 --> 00:55:51,411
<font color="yellow">that you like her.</font>

772
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:56,711
<font color="yellow">Never.</font>

773
00:55:57,011 --> 00:55:58,011
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

774
00:55:58,011 --> 00:56:00,771
<font color="yellow">You saw. She's dating my friend.</font>

775
00:56:00,911 --> 00:56:03,471
<font color="yellow">- Take her away. - I can't. I introduced them.</font>

776
00:56:03,471 --> 00:56:05,371
<font color="yellow">- Take her away anyway. - How?</font>

777
00:56:06,471 --> 00:56:09,211
<font color="yellow">She had a crush on you for three years.</font>

778
00:56:09,811 --> 00:56:11,241
<font color="yellow">She'll come to you if you ask.</font>

779
00:56:17,411 --> 00:56:19,641
<font color="yellow">- Really? - She'll come right over,</font>

780
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:21,141
<font color="yellow">from what I see.</font>

781
00:56:22,941 --> 00:56:24,041
<font color="yellow">Do you think so?</font>

782
00:56:24,111 --> 00:56:27,441
<font color="yellow">Of course. Na Ri may be waiting for it.</font>

783
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:32,671
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

784
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:35,011
<font color="yellow">Forget about stupid friendships.</font>

785
00:56:35,571 --> 00:56:37,971
<font color="yellow">Others don't even worry about things like this.</font>

786
00:56:42,811 --> 00:56:44,971
<font color="yellow">I guess that's possible.</font>

787
00:56:45,911 --> 00:56:49,741
<font color="yellow">Love. Love is the most important.</font>

788
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,211
<font color="yellow">Naturally.</font>

789
00:56:52,911 --> 00:56:54,611
<font color="yellow">You'll just be a scumbag, that's all.</font>

790
00:56:56,211 --> 00:56:57,211
<font color="yellow">A scumbag?</font>

791
00:56:58,471 --> 00:56:59,471
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

792
00:57:00,411 --> 00:57:01,841
<font color="yellow">You don't want to be a scumbag?</font>

793
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:04,171
<font color="yellow">Are you teasing me?</font>

794
00:57:04,371 --> 00:57:05,541
<font color="yellow">Obviously.</font>

795
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:58,571
<font color="yellow">So, Hwa Shin,</font>

796
00:57:59,711 --> 00:58:01,971
<font color="yellow">don't become a scumbag,</font>

797
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:06,471
<font color="yellow">and do the nine o'clock news with me and date me...</font>

798
00:58:06,811 --> 00:58:09,111
<font color="yellow">- and... - You don't think I can do it?</font>

799
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:21,233
<font color="yellow">I can be a scumbag.</font>

800
00:59:13,571 --> 00:59:15,241
<font color="yellow">Did something happen between you two?</font>

801
00:59:15,241 --> 00:59:17,911
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to or even look at Na Ri.</font>

802
00:59:17,911 --> 00:59:19,571
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

803
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:21,411
<font color="yellow">Please, get lost!</font>

804
00:59:21,411 --> 00:59:23,371
<font color="yellow">You get lost.</font>

805
00:59:23,371 --> 00:59:26,411
<font color="yellow">I'm going out of town tomorrow with Ms Gye for a story.</font>

806
00:59:26,411 --> 00:59:28,341
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to see the ocean?</font>

807
00:59:28,341 --> 00:59:29,571
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

808
00:59:29,571 --> 00:59:32,571
<font color="yellow">Is dating what changed you?</font>

809
00:59:32,641 --> 00:59:33,941
<font color="yellow">Get your act together.</font>

810
00:59:33,941 --> 00:59:36,111
<font color="yellow">You'll lose both your friend and your love.</font>

811
00:59:36,111 --> 00:59:37,811
<font color="yellow">Don't let Na Ri find out how you feel.</font>

812
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:39,571
<font color="yellow">- Are you scared? - Are you challenging me?</font>

813
00:59:39,571 --> 00:59:40,741
<font color="yellow">Are you scared?</font>
