00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,280
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee.</font>

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,450
<font color="yellow">You left your phone.</font>

4
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,480
<font color="yellow">You're here already?</font>

5
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,750
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mum.</font>

6
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,510
<font color="yellow">Is your girlfriend here?</font>

7
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,120
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

8
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,910
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

9
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,610
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell her to come.</font>

10
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,450
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

11
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,980
<font color="yellow">I wanted to play hard-to-get.</font>

12
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,580
<font color="yellow">I mean,</font>

13
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,050
<font color="yellow">she won't introduce me to her family.
If I introduce her to you,</font>

14
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,950
<font color="yellow">she'll think I like her more.</font>

15
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,610
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that? Why
didn't you tell her to come?</font>

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,280
<font color="yellow">The guy is supposed to like the girl more.</font>

17
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,350
<font color="yellow">That creates a happy marriage.</font>

18
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,710
<font color="yellow">You should like her more.</font>

19
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,350
<font color="yellow">You should keep liking her more.</font>

20
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,180
<font color="yellow">It's okay if she finds out.</font>

21
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,480
<font color="yellow">I'll wait inside, so call her now to come.</font>

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,709
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

23
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,350
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

24
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,010
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

25
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,450
<font color="yellow">Let me weigh my options and see if
there's a better girl out there.</font>

26
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,020
<font color="yellow">Let me do the maths.</font>

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,850
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I'm losing out?</font>

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,050
<font color="yellow">Aren't you sad about letting
some other girl have me?</font>

29
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,020
<font color="yellow">I'll think hard about whether or
not I should marry this girl.</font>

30
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,810
<font color="yellow">You freak.</font>

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,520
<font color="yellow">Why are you wasting my time?</font>

32
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,409
<font color="yellow">You brat.</font>

33
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,520
<font color="yellow">I spent the whole day getting my hair done.</font>

34
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,310
<font color="yellow">Hey. What?</font>

35
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,950
<font color="yellow">You'll think about it?</font>

36
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,780
<font color="yellow">- Think about what?
- Come on.</font>

37
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,110
<font color="yellow">- I...
- Hey.</font>

38
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,080
<font color="yellow">Why would I be sad to lose you?</font>

39
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,610
<font color="yellow">I'm not sad at all.</font>

40
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,350
<font color="yellow">Please get married.</font>

41
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,910
<font color="yellow">My blood pressure won't
go down because of you.</font>

42
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,309
<font color="yellow">Whoever it is, I'm about to
bow down to the woman...</font>

43
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,110
<font color="yellow">who is willing to marry you to
please take you off my hands.</font>

44
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,410
<font color="yellow">- Sad? Whatever.
- Mum.</font>

45
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,080
<font color="yellow">Should I just live alone?</font>

46
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,310
<font color="yellow">Shut it!</font>

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,050
<font color="yellow">You punk.</font>

48
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,980
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

49
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,110
<font color="yellow">If you ever say you'll live
alone in front of me again,</font>

50
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,050
<font color="yellow">I'll pull out every
single hair on your head.</font>

51
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,210
<font color="yellow">If you did something wrong,
go beg for forgiveness.</font>

52
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,780
<font color="yellow">If you're not good enough, go
kiss up and say you'll do better.</font>

53
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,550
<font color="yellow">Don't try to kill me by saying
you'll live alone. Got it?</font>

54
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,850
<font color="yellow">Answer me.</font>

55
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,580
<font color="yellow">Kiss up?</font>

56
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,380
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

57
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,380
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

58
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,950
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Are you on your way?</font>

59
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,010
<font color="yellow">I forgot I had a radio show tonight.</font>

60
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,110
<font color="yellow">I can't make it.</font>

61
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,980
<font color="yellow">Did you call your mother?</font>

62
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,350
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

63
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,050
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

64
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,680
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

65
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,050
<font color="yellow">Don't be sorry.</font>

66
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,150
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

67
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,380
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

68
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,680
<font color="yellow">You need a pretty heart to be a woman.</font>

69
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,550
<font color="yellow">A pretty face doesn't make you a woman.</font>

70
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,410
<font color="yellow">A woman whose heart doesn't change
once she gives it to a man.</font>

71
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,610
<font color="yellow">Is a true woman.</font>

72
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,850
<font color="yellow">When I knew love.</font>

73
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,950
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

74
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:57,180
<font color="yellow">Even if she were to go blind.</font>

75
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,810
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

76
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,550
<font color="yellow">Her eyes sparkle like the stars.</font>

77
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,980
<font color="yellow">You need a pretty heart to be a woman.</font>

78
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,949
<font color="yellow">A pretty face doesn't make you a woman.</font>

79
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,080
<font color="yellow">Were you dumped?</font>

80
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,180
<font color="yellow">Shut your trap.</font>

81
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,910
<font color="yellow">- That is a true woman - Hey, hey.</font>

82
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,910
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to see if
you can beat alcohol?</font>

83
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,810
<font color="yellow">Historically, alcohol is bound to win.</font>

84
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,680
<font color="yellow">- It wins all the time.
- What?</font>

85
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,579
<font color="yellow">- How did you know?
- Hey.</font>

86
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,980
<font color="yellow">Are you really dating Na
Ri, as the rumours say?</font>

87
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,180
<font color="yellow">Where the flowers.</font>

88
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,710
<font color="yellow">Bloom and wilt.</font>

89
00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:01,010
<font color="yellow">On the fields.</font>

90
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,850
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

91
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,880
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

92
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,750
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

93
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,680
<font color="yellow">You reek of alcohol.</font>

94
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,480
<font color="yellow">Where do you think you're going?</font>

95
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,280
<font color="yellow">With whom did you drink?</font>

96
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,380
<font color="yellow">You said you had a radio show.</font>

97
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,150
<font color="yellow">Where are you sitting?</font>

98
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,880
<font color="yellow">Did you just sit? Get up. Now.</font>

99
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,810
<font color="yellow">Chi Yul is studying downstairs.</font>

100
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,880
<font color="yellow">Get up. Hurry. Get up.</font>

101
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,450
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

102
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,450
<font color="yellow">Chi Yul will be here soon.</font>

103
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,410
<font color="yellow">What do you plan to do?</font>

104
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,080
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

105
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,710
<font color="yellow">With whom did you drink?
How much did you drink?</font>

106
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,750
<font color="yellow">How much did you drink?</font>

107
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,680
<font color="yellow">Do you want some coffee?</font>

108
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
<font color="yellow">Water?</font>

109
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,850
<font color="yellow">You're so frustrating.</font>

110
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,810
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you talking at all?</font>

111
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,509
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Why are you taking that off?
You need to go.</font>

112
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,910
<font color="yellow">Go home and sleep. Go.</font>

113
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,480
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sleep. I'm sleepy.</font>

114
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,180
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

115
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,610
<font color="yellow">You're fine. Don't act drunk.</font>

116
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,509
<font color="yellow">Don't act confused. Get up.</font>

117
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,710
<font color="yellow">You know this is my bed and my home.
Get up.</font>

118
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,680
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

119
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,810
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

120
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,280
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

121
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,180
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

122
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,510
<font color="yellow">Go. It's late.</font>

123
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,510
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you drank as soon as
you finished radiation treatment.</font>

124
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,650
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

125
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,850
<font color="yellow">I checked our compatibility.</font>

126
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,580
<font color="yellow">You don't like things like that.</font>

127
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,420
<font color="yellow">I don't like it. I hate it.
I'm not interested at all.</font>

128
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,150
<font color="yellow">But I wanted to check
because it's with you.</font>

129
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,950
<font color="yellow">I was curious if I'd be
able to make you happy.</font>

130
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,880
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

131
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,680
<font color="yellow">What did they say?</font>

132
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,280
<font color="yellow">- It's a secret.
- Come on. Don't be like that.</font>

133
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,420
<font color="yellow">Then don't bring it up.</font>

134
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,280
<font color="yellow">Tell me. Is it good or bad?</font>

135
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,810
<font color="yellow">Go on. Tell me.</font>

136
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,749
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

137
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,010
<font color="yellow">Tell me. You brought it up.
The curiosity is killing me.</font>

138
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,950
<font color="yellow">We have no kids.</font>

139
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,010
<font color="yellow">Who said that? The fortune teller?</font>

140
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Who was it?</font>

141
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,380
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

142
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,180
<font color="yellow">I'll go and ask myself.</font>

143
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,110
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

144
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,310
<font color="yellow">Did you go to a famous fortune teller?</font>

145
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,420
<font color="yellow">Is that person supposed to be good?</font>

146
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,280
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

147
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,180
<font color="yellow">Really? Then we'll ask someone else.</font>

148
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,810
<font color="yellow">Are you not okay about having no kids?</font>

149
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,920
<font color="yellow">Of course I'm not okay. I
want to be a good mum.</font>

150
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,280
<font color="yellow">Is that okay with you?</font>

151
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,080
<font color="yellow">See? You like kids too, right?</font>

152
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,310
<font color="yellow">Did you get plastered because of what...</font>

153
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,780
<font color="yellow">one fortune teller told you?</font>

154
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,920
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Are you that upset...</font>

155
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,110
<font color="yellow">because that one fortune teller
told you we can't have kids?</font>

156
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,110
<font color="yellow">Are you upset?</font>

157
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,280
<font color="yellow">What time did you say I was born?</font>

158
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,310
<font color="yellow">8am.</font>

159
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,980
<font color="yellow">I was born at 8pm.</font>

160
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,780
<font color="yellow">You got that wrong already.</font>

161
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,210
<font color="yellow">Look. Let's go together next
time to check our compatibility.</font>

162
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,779
<font color="yellow">Don't give them wrong information...</font>

163
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,580
<font color="yellow">and get some ridiculous predictions, okay?</font>

164
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,410
<font color="yellow">Why do you like me?</font>

165
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,179
<font color="yellow">Because you're manly.</font>

166
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,010
<font color="yellow">- Not that.
- Not that?</font>

167
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,210
<font color="yellow">There's nothing else.</font>

168
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,180
<font color="yellow">Don't tease me.</font>

169
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,410
<font color="yellow">Is it...</font>

170
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,280
<font color="yellow">okay that I have breast cancer?</font>

171
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,810
<font color="yellow">Even if it's just one fortune teller,</font>

172
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,410
<font color="yellow">she said we can't have kids. Is that okay?</font>

173
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,850
<font color="yellow">Are you okay with a man...</font>

174
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,180
<font color="yellow">who has breast cancer and can't have kids?</font>

175
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,850
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you today?</font>

176
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,580
<font color="yellow">I am a man, right?</font>

177
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,780
<font color="yellow">Don't laugh.</font>

178
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,050
<font color="yellow">You got surgery, so the
breast cancer is fine.</font>

179
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,909
<font color="yellow">I'll go to 100 fortune tellers...</font>

180
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,479
<font color="yellow">and find a bunch that say...</font>

181
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,850
<font color="yellow">we'll have lots of kids, okay?</font>

182
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,980
<font color="yellow">What's the problem? What's wrong?</font>

183
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,880
<font color="yellow">What's the problem? What's wrong?</font>

184
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,780
<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh.</font>

185
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,409
<font color="yellow">You're acting suspicious. Why did you hide?</font>

186
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,280
<font color="yellow">I wasn't hiding.</font>

187
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,980
<font color="yellow">I dropped my pen, so I was picking it up.</font>

188
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,180
<font color="yellow">I don't want it.</font>

189
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,180
<font color="yellow">It's good for you.</font>

190
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,380
<font color="yellow">Did you put the money back
without Hwa Shin catching you?</font>

191
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,850
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

192
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,310
<font color="yellow">Did you get stuck there...</font>

193
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,410
<font color="yellow">until morning because Hwa Shin came home?</font>

194
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,279
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

195
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,310
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

196
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,680
<font color="yellow">Where did you hide in his tiny apartment?</font>

197
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,210
<font color="yellow">In his closet?</font>

198
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,910
<font color="yellow">- What?
- That's the only place to hide.</font>

199
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,950
<font color="yellow">Together?</font>

200
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

201
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,680
<font color="yellow">Until morning?</font>

202
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

203
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,380
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened, right?</font>

204
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,550
<font color="yellow">- Like what?
- I'm sure.</font>

205
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,680
<font color="yellow">You can spend 100 nights
with an asexual man,</font>

206
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,410
<font color="yellow">and nothing will happen.</font>

207
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,179
<font color="yellow">After counting all the festivals
that were held nationwide,</font>

208
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,380
<font color="yellow">we found out that there were 46 every day.</font>

209
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,950
<font color="yellow">829 million dollars were
spent for the budget.</font>

210
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,480
<font color="yellow">Was it really a waste? Was
it held just for themselves?</font>

211
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,650
<font color="yellow">Lee Hyun Jong reports.</font>

212
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,380
<font color="yellow">- Yesterday afternoon...
- Finally, the weather.</font>

213
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,180
<font color="yellow">You know there were breaking
news earlier, right?</font>

214
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,800
<font color="yellow">The weather completely changed from before.
Are you ready?</font>

215
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,780
<font color="yellow">- Okay, stand by.
- Okay.</font>

216
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,810
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her? What's wrong?</font>

217
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,479
<font color="yellow">Joo Hee, are you okay?</font>

218
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,720
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with her?
- Why are you sweating so much?</font>

219
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,480
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Yes.</font>

220
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,180
<font color="yellow">Can you do it?</font>

221
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,580
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

222
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,310
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you okay?</font>

223
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,650
<font color="yellow">She doesn't look well.</font>

224
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,010
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

225
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,850
<font color="yellow">Dong Gi, I think Joo Hee is sick.</font>

226
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,110
<font color="yellow">She doesn't look well.
Get her out of there.</font>

227
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,280
<font color="yellow">Hey. Can you do it?</font>

228
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,480
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

229
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,780
<font color="yellow">Are you very sick? Where does it hurt?</font>

230
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,850
<font color="yellow">I need to do the weather.</font>

231
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,550
<font color="yellow">It's going to get very cold.</font>

232
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,480
<font color="yellow">Her appendix. Her appendix burst.</font>

233
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,310
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? Call 911.
- Appendix?</font>

234
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,880
<font color="yellow">The weather. Do the weather first.</font>

235
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,580
<font color="yellow">- Hurry. Hurry.
- Dong Gi, she can't do it.</font>

236
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,679
<font color="yellow">What's the special weather report?</font>

237
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,009
<font color="yellow">There was a warning of strong
winds since 15 minutes ago.</font>

238
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,380
<font color="yellow">It's not a hurricane. Let's
just skip the weather.</font>

239
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

240
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,649
<font color="yellow">Should we take it out? Can we take it out?
It was a warning.</font>

241
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,050
<font color="yellow">The weather is news, too.
We can't take it out.</font>

242
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,680
<font color="yellow">Do we have a replacement if we take it out?</font>

243
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,750
<font color="yellow">You can't take the weather out.</font>

244
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,780
<font color="yellow">Hey. Do you have a one-minute news clip?</font>

245
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,310
<font color="yellow">Hey. Look for something
that we can throw in.</font>

246
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,580
<font color="yellow">- Find something!
- The wind advisory was just issued.</font>

247
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,579
<font color="yellow">If people walk around in this
cold without an umbrella,</font>

248
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,480
<font color="yellow">they'll catch a cold.</font>

249
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,279
<font color="yellow">Today's weather is as
important as the flu shot.</font>

250
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,110
<font color="yellow">Stay quiet. We don't have a weather
forecaster. What can we do?</font>

251
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,109
<font color="yellow">Dong Gi, did you find something?</font>

252
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,380
<font color="yellow">I'll just drag out the closing.</font>

253
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,779
<font color="yellow">The weather and closing is the same thing.</font>

254
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,280
<font color="yellow">I'll do the weather.</font>

255
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,480
<font color="yellow">- You?
- You?</font>

256
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,580
<font color="yellow">We found something.</font>

257
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,379
<font color="yellow">We'll play something we
were going to use at noon.</font>

258
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,410
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

259
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,749
<font color="yellow">You have to do the closing...</font>

260
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,779
<font color="yellow">right after the weather. Can
you make it back in time?</font>

261
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,280
<font color="yellow">You may never be able to sit here again.</font>

262
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,180

ago, so people are unprepared.</font>

<font color="yellow">They may look like they aren't watching,</font>

265
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,679
<font color="yellow">but they listen to the weather
to decide what to wear...</font>

266
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,780
<font color="yellow">and whether or not to bring
an umbrella with them.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'll do the weather.</font>

268
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,409
<font color="yellow">What should we do? What should we do?
Hurry. Decide.</font>

269

<font color="yellow">- How many seconds do we have left?
- Is Na Ri doing the weather?</font>

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,410
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

308
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,690
<font color="yellow">Are you an anchor or a weather forecaster?</font>

309
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,650
<font color="yellow">Are you a weather forecaster
or an anchor? What?</font>

310
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,080
<font color="yellow">Choose one. Get your act together.</font>

311
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,650
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

312
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,310
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

313
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,780
<font color="yellow">(Weather)</font>

314
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,180
<font color="yellow">Where do you think you're sitting?</font>

315
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,410
<font color="yellow">An anchor with breast cancer who
may quit because she's sick.</font>

316
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,880
<font color="yellow">Will you actually get hired full-time?</font>

317
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,880
<font color="yellow">Hey, my wife said she saw you...</font>

318
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,510
<font color="yellow">getting radiation treatment.</font>

319
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,880
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

320
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,680
<font color="yellow">Tell Hwa Shin...</font>

321
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,650
<font color="yellow">to come to me and beg on
his knees for forgiveness.</font>

322
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,180
<font color="yellow">Then I won't tell anyone.</font>

323
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,680
<font color="yellow">That will not happen.</font>

324
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,180
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

325
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,180
<font color="yellow">Just do your own job.</font>

326
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,550
<font color="yellow">Your eyes are sleepy. Are
they rotten fish eyes?</font>

327
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,100
<font color="yellow">People will fall asleep
while watching the news.</font>

328
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,150
<font color="yellow">Don't only work on picking
on junior reporters.</font>

329
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

330
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,680
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

331
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,180
<font color="yellow">That jerk.</font>

332
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,780
<font color="yellow">Why that...</font>

333
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,450
<font color="yellow">He needs another beating.</font>

334
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,380
<font color="yellow">What did he say to you?</font>

335
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,880
<font color="yellow">Nothing much.</font>

336
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,620
<font color="yellow">That jerk.</font>

337
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,450
<font color="yellow">There's never a quiet day.</font>

338
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,880
<font color="yellow">It's so annoying. I'm so sick of it.</font>

339
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,780
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

340
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,780
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- What? What?</font>

341
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,880
<font color="yellow">- About Na Ri...
- What now?</font>

342
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,980
<font color="yellow">Did you know she has breast cancer?</font>

343
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

344
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,450
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for her.</font>

345
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,650
<font color="yellow">- Mr Oh.
- Knock first.</font>

346
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,550
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

347
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,620
<font color="yellow">Did you know Na Ri has breast cancer?</font>

348
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,180
<font color="yellow">- Breast cancer?
- What?</font>

349
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,680
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for her.</font>

350
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,350
<font color="yellow">- Sung Sook.
- Ja Young.</font>

351
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,620
<font color="yellow">Did you know Na Ri has breast cancer?</font>

352
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,880
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What?</font>

353
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,010
<font color="yellow">Poor thing.</font>

354
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,180
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

355
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,780
<font color="yellow">Did you or did you not watch
the weather I just did,</font>

356
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,980
<font color="yellow">which I risked my anchor position for?</font>

357
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:11,250
<font color="yellow">Did I or did I not say that there
will be strong winds and rain?</font>

358
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,250
<font color="yellow">My gosh. It's pouring hard.</font>

359
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,080
<font color="yellow">- Mr Lee.
- Where were you going?</font>

360
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,550
<font color="yellow">I came after you to bring you the umbrella.</font>

361
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,379
<font color="yellow">You stormed out of the studio,</font>

362
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,680
<font color="yellow">so I knew you were going
out without an umbrella.</font>

363
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,350
<font color="yellow">That's why I ran after you with
one, so you wouldn't get wet.</font>

364
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,180
<font color="yellow">You know these things after
having a crush for three years.</font>

365
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,010
<font color="yellow">For three years, I couldn't give
you an umbrella even if I had one.</font>

366
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,550
<font color="yellow">Now, I can run after you and
hold it over your head.</font>

367
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,650
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy.</font>

368
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,380
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee.</font>

369
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,650
<font color="yellow">Look outside.</font>

370
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,980
<font color="yellow">It's morning,</font>

371
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,809
<font color="yellow">but because of the rain,</font>

372
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,650
<font color="yellow">it's dark and feels like night, doesn't it?</font>

373
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,380
<font color="yellow">It does.</font>

374
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,179
<font color="yellow">With the rain and wind,</font>

375
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,880
<font color="yellow">doesn't it seem like people
can't see inside the car?</font>

376
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,250
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

377
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,350
<font color="yellow">This is nice.</font>

378
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,780
<font color="yellow">What is?</font>

379
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,380
<font color="yellow">They can't see us.</font>

380
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,120
<font color="yellow">You said the sun will be
out in the afternoon.</font>

381
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,810
<font color="yellow">No one can see what we do.</font>

382
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

383
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,250
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

384
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,810
<font color="yellow">- My gosh.
- Right?</font>

385
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,780
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee.</font>

386
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,780
<font color="yellow">They wouldn't know even
if we kissed, right?</font>

387
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,980
<font color="yellow">It's thrilling at a parking lot.</font>

388
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,550
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

389
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,810
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

390
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,450
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

391
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,510
<font color="yellow">- Are you busy?
- Yes, I'm busy.</font>

392
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,780
<font color="yellow">You're getting a car wash.
Why are you so busy?</font>

393
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,710
<font color="yellow">I don't need a car wash any more,
so I'm going out for a story.</font>

394
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,610
<font color="yellow">- Mr Lee.
- What?</font>

395
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,650
<font color="yellow">You were going to get a car
wash, so you have time to kill.</font>

396
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,510
<font color="yellow">Let's go to that fortune teller
you went to yesterday...</font>

397
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,080
<font color="yellow">and get another reading together.</font>

398
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:54,180
<font color="yellow">You see, 8am and 8pm are
completely different.</font>

399
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,180
<font color="yellow">I'm sure there will be
kids in our next reading.</font>

400
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,480
<font color="yellow">Okay? Let's go. Let's go.</font>

401
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,280
<font color="yellow">Don't be so upset.</font>

402
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,650
<font color="yellow">And don't drink.</font>

403
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

404
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,910
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

405
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,610
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

406
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,180
<font color="yellow">I said get out.</font>

407
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,680
<font color="yellow">Give me the umbrella.</font>

408
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,780
<font color="yellow">His mum's over at his place.
Why isn't he picking up?</font>

409
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,510
<font color="yellow">You have no other problems.</font>

410
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,980
<font color="yellow">But you can't have kids
in your current state.</font>

411
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,180
<font color="yellow">Is it because of the breast cancer?</font>

412
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,649
<font color="yellow">The radiation treatments increase
the amount of exposed blood,</font>

413
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,280
<font color="yellow">so you can't completely ignore it.</font>

414
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,250
<font color="yellow">But since it was breast cancer,
it was only in the torso,</font>

415
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,980
<font color="yellow">so it's very rare. We'll
have to keep monitoring.</font>

416
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,980
<font color="yellow">Smoking and drinking may
affect it, as well.</font>

417
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,180
<font color="yellow">People usually suddenly find
out that they're impotent.</font>

418
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,810
<font color="yellow">No one suspects that they
are impotent beforehand.</font>

419
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,480
<font color="yellow">I thought a thorough test would
say something different.</font>

420
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,280
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Na Ri.</font>

421
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,710
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

422
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,580
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

423
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,980
<font color="yellow">Do you plan to marry her
without telling her?</font>

424
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,380
<font color="yellow">Then why are you telling
me not to tell her?</font>

425
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,780
<font color="yellow">Are you going to break up?</font>

426
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,980
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

427
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,710
<font color="yellow">Are you going to marry her?</font>

428
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,980
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

429
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,780
<font color="yellow">Are you going to date her?</font>

430
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

431
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,009
<font color="yellow">Then you won't do anything?</font>

432
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,279
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Then what will you do?</font>

433
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,280
<font color="yellow">I'll do everything.</font>

434
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,009
<font color="yellow">You're out of your mind.</font>

435
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,810
<font color="yellow">How could I not be?</font>

436
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,880
<font color="yellow">You should get psychiatric help.</font>

437
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,880
<font color="yellow">I'm too nervous. You'll
end up doing something.</font>

438
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,280
<font color="yellow">Don't be afraid of psychiatrists.
It's nothing to be afraid of.</font>

439
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,980
<font color="yellow">You just talk to them and consult them.</font>

440
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,150
<font color="yellow">Your mind need to be at peace
so that your body can heal.</font>

441
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,010
<font color="yellow">I'll go to a breast cancer
clinic, a urologist...</font>

442
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,279
<font color="yellow">and a psychiatrist. You also
said my liver is unhealthy.</font>

443
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,510
<font color="yellow">Whom do I go to for that?</font>

444
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,510
<font color="yellow">Every time I come to this
hospital, I can just...</font>

445
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,980
<font color="yellow">go from department to department...</font>

446
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,650
<font color="yellow">and get diagnosed, treated,
diagnosed and then treated.</font>

447
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,180
<font color="yellow">I'll keep getting psychiatric
help throughout.</font>

448
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,280
<font color="yellow">Here's your prescription.</font>

449
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,180
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to take your
medicine every day without fail.</font>

450
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,510
<font color="yellow">What do I say if she calls?</font>

451
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,250
<font color="yellow">You're good at lying.</font>

452
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,550
<font color="yellow">It's my first time meeting a man
with breast cancer who is impotent.</font>

453
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,450
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

454
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,480
<font color="yellow">Why me?</font>

455
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,910
<font color="yellow">You are...</font>

456
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,910
<font color="yellow">the manliest man I've ever met.</font>

457
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,810
<font color="yellow">Is that supposed to console me?</font>

458
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,909
<font color="yellow">Don't be alone.</font>

459
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,080
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything rash.</font>

460
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,379
<font color="yellow">I want to be alone, and I
want to do something rash.</font>

461
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,609
<font color="yellow">I want to die. I'm afraid to see women.</font>

462
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,450
<font color="yellow">Na Ri scares me the most,
and I'm embarrassed.</font>

463
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,610
<font color="yellow">I'm confused of whether
I'm a man or a woman.</font>

464
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,379
<font color="yellow">I don't know if the light is green or red.</font>

465
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,780
<font color="yellow">Everything looks like it's stuck
in the middle. I'm going crazy.</font>

466
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,580
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid of the camera
when I'm on air, too.</font>

467
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,080
<font color="yellow">I've never once feared the camera,</font>

468
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,380
<font color="yellow">but now, I feel like...</font>

469
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,249
<font color="yellow">the camera is mocking me
and looking down on me.</font>

470
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,780
<font color="yellow">I feel like it's jeering at
me and looking right into me.</font>

471
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,180
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

472
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,410
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

473
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,910
<font color="yellow">don't tell Na Ri.</font>

474
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,779
<font color="yellow">If you do, I'll jump into the Han River.</font>

475
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,780
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'll make sure to...</font>

476
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,810
<font color="yellow">It cleared up so quickly.</font>

477
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,980
<font color="yellow">It was raining so hard.</font>

478
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,750
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

479
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,580
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

480
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,409
<font color="yellow">You're all bundled up.</font>

481
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,880
<font color="yellow">You said to bundle up this morning.</font>

482
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,380
<font color="yellow">Did you watch?</font>

483
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:16,480
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

484
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,110
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I wore a jacket this
morning and brought an umbrella.</font>

485
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,380
<font color="yellow">But it cleared up quickly.</font>

486
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,110
<font color="yellow">It did.</font>

487
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,750
<font color="yellow">You should come when he's home.</font>

488
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,410
<font color="yellow">I only came to fill up his refrigerator.</font>

489
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,850
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

490
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,380
<font color="yellow">Have you had lunch?</font>

491
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,280
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

492
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,180
<font color="yellow">The seasoning is slightly salty.
It's perfect for my tastebuds.</font>

493
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,980
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

494
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,210
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin likes his food too bland.</font>

495
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:57,080
<font color="yellow">I have to eat such bland
foods because of him.</font>

496
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,580
<font color="yellow">Even still, you need a little flavour.
Don't you agree?</font>

497
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,380
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

498
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,480
<font color="yellow">What kind of a daughter-in-law do you want?</font>

499
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,850
<font color="yellow">What kind of a daughter-in-law?</font>

500
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,880
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

501
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,280
<font color="yellow">Nothing matters as long
as Hwa Shin likes her.</font>

502
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,550
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Of course.</font>

503
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,780
<font color="yellow">He seems to have someone.</font>

504
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,380
<font color="yellow">He was supposed to introduce her
to me, but he changed his mind.</font>

505
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,050
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

506
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,950
<font color="yellow">Are things going well with Jung Won?</font>

507
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,750
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

508
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,280
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

509
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,980
<font color="yellow">Is it cooked?</font>

510
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,579
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

511
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,580
<font color="yellow">- Do you like it?
- I do. Here.</font>

512
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,680
<font color="yellow">Try one.</font>

513
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,750
<font color="yellow">From here...</font>

514
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,280
<font color="yellow">to here. Give me everything.</font>

515
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,910
<font color="yellow">That too.</font>

516
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,180
<font color="yellow">I'll take it all.</font>

517
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,580
<font color="yellow">That's 998.</font>

518
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,780
<font color="yellow">Give me everything from here to there.</font>

519
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,850
<font color="yellow">I'll take these, too.</font>

520
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,410
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

521
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,850
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

522
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,260
<font color="yellow">You don't think I can afford it?</font>

523
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,649
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind?</font>

524
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,480
<font color="yellow">I make good money.</font>

525
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,280
<font color="yellow">I want it all.</font>

526
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,910
<font color="yellow">I have money. Do you
think I can't afford it?</font>

527
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,480
<font color="yellow">Do you think I took clothes from
you because I didn't have money?</font>

528
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,750
<font color="yellow">I'll change into a new one every hour.</font>

529
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,310
<font color="yellow">This.</font>

530
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,050
<font color="yellow">Bring out anything else you have!</font>

531
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,880
<font color="yellow">They're all mine. Na Ri is mine, too.</font>

532
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,780
<font color="yellow">I'm the only man for Na Ri.</font>

533
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,080
<font color="yellow">I'm the only man.</font>

534
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,050
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

535
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:33,180
<font color="yellow">- Hi.
- Hi.</font>

536
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,380
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- No problem.</font>

537
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,680
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

538
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,380
<font color="yellow">- I'm fine.
- Hey.</font>

539
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,580
<font color="yellow">You looked so excited doing the weather.</font>

540
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,480
<font color="yellow">I liked it, too.</font>

541
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,110
<font color="yellow">But seriously,</font>

542
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,210
<font color="yellow">I heard Mr Park is going around
saying you have breast cancer.</font>

543
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,780
<font color="yellow">It isn't true, is it?</font>

544
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,380
<font color="yellow">He picks on you, and now, he
spreads a ridiculous rumour.</font>

545
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,280
<font color="yellow">What's his problem?</font>

546
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,210
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

547
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,910
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

548
00:33:06,911 --> 00:33:09,480
<font color="yellow">I had surgery.</font>

549
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,950
<font color="yellow">And it's stage one.</font>

550
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,850
<font color="yellow">I finished radiation treatment, too.</font>

551
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,150
<font color="yellow">I'm fine now.</font>

552
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,380
<font color="yellow">But you're so young.</font>

553
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,910
<font color="yellow">You should be careful.</font>

554
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,550
<font color="yellow">You're employed under contract.</font>

555
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,680
<font color="yellow">The company wouldn't like that.</font>

556
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,210
<font color="yellow">I'm all better now.</font>

557
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,910
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Just make sure to pass gas.</font>

558
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,080
<font color="yellow">It won't come out.</font>

559
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,010
<font color="yellow">But I smelled it.</font>

560
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,680
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

561
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,780
<font color="yellow">Are you not okay about having no kids?</font>

562
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,150
<font color="yellow">Of course I'm not okay. I
want to be a good mum.</font>

563
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,080
<font color="yellow">Is that okay with you?</font>

564
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,950
<font color="yellow">See? You like kids too, right?</font>

565
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,550
<font color="yellow">Are you looking for something?</font>

566
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,480
<font color="yellow">Are you looking for something?</font>

567
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,280
<font color="yellow">This.</font>

568
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,950
<font color="yellow">I'll take everything here!</font>

569
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,180
<font color="yellow">Everything.</font>

570
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,380
<font color="yellow">Are you moving in?</font>

571
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,650
<font color="yellow">Take them all. They're all yours.</font>

572
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,280
<font color="yellow">I bought them all for you.</font>

573
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,110
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

574
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,210
<font color="yellow">Are you insane? Why did you buy so much?</font>

575
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,280
<font color="yellow">What is this? Baby clothes?</font>

576
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,580
<font color="yellow">Aren't they cute?</font>

577
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,980
<font color="yellow">How many kids do you want to have?</font>

578
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
<font color="yellow">Why did you buy these already?</font>

579
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,050
<font color="yellow">We'd better start now.</font>

580
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,280
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

581
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,280
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

582
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,910
<font color="yellow">Nothing's wrong.</font>

583
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,150
<font color="yellow">- Yes, there is.
- No, there isn't.</font>

584
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,150
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

585
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,680
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

586
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,410
<font color="yellow">- For what?
- That I can't be like others guys.</font>

587
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,020
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

588
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,050
<font color="yellow">- No. I'm not qualified.
- To do what?</font>

589
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,550
<font color="yellow">To receive your love.</font>

590
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,210
<font color="yellow">Why do you like me?</font>

591
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,580
<font color="yellow">You're sexy. You're super hot.</font>

592
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,850
<font color="yellow">You look so good when you do the
news that I want to watch it alone.</font>

593
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,410
<font color="yellow">Can you live without me?</font>

594
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,780
<font color="yellow">Answer me.</font>

595
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,580
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking that? You're scaring me.</font>

596
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,210
<font color="yellow">I can't live without you.</font>

597
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,779
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

598
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,680
<font color="yellow">Nowhere. Sleep.</font>

599
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,180
<font color="yellow">Sleep.</font>

600
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,020
<font color="yellow">Hi. You're home.</font>

601
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,150
<font color="yellow">Where are you tiptoeing off to
in the middle of the night?</font>

602
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,480
<font color="yellow">Just study.</font>

603
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,650
<font color="yellow">No. No!</font>

604
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,680
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

605
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,680
<font color="yellow">Where did she go now?</font>

606
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,310
<font color="yellow">Where did she go in the
middle of the night?</font>

607
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,380
<font color="yellow">Did he cure his asexuality?</font>

608
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,180
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

609
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,780
<font color="yellow">I should've been the one
to put the money back.</font>

610
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,740
<font color="yellow">I should've been the one to
get trapped in the closet.</font>

611
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,310
<font color="yellow">What a waste.</font>

612
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,880
<font color="yellow">I'm so lonely.</font>

613
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,210
<font color="yellow">I'm so cold.</font>

614
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:11,519
<font color="yellow">The National Statistical
Office's investigation showed...</font>

615
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,310
<font color="yellow">that the price index for the consumer...</font>

616
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,409
<font color="yellow">rose 1.3 percent compared to last year.</font>

617
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,549
<font color="yellow">I hear it's breast cancer.</font>

618
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:23,079
<font color="yellow">It's the biggest increase
since last February.</font>

619
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,179
<font color="yellow">When did you find out?</font>

620
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,649
<font color="yellow">The price has risen...</font>

621
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,979
<font color="yellow">- Be good to her.
- And has brought up the cost...</font>

622
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,449
<font color="yellow">especially for certain items...</font>

623
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,580
<font color="yellow">like vegetables.</font>

624
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,550
<font color="yellow">I heard you went to the hospital with her.</font>

625
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,550
<font color="yellow">That is all for today.</font>

626
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,680
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

627
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,380
<font color="yellow">Good job, Na Ri.</font>

628
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,649
<font color="yellow">Good job everyone.</font>

629
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,150
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Thank you.</font>

630
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,310
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's true.</font>

631
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:55,780
<font color="yellow">I got surgery and finished
getting radiation treatment,</font>

632
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,980
<font color="yellow">so I'll make sure there's no problem
being here to do the news every day.</font>

633
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,610
<font color="yellow">Having breast cancer isn't a sin.</font>

634
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,380
<font color="yellow">Wow. I didn't know Hwa Shin...</font>

635
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:12,880
<font color="yellow">would go somewhere like that for a woman.</font>

636
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,680
<font color="yellow">I misjudged him.</font>

637
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,610
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

638
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,250
<font color="yellow">I think HR found out that
she has breast cancer.</font>

639
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,980
<font color="yellow">Na Ri won't be able to get
a full-time position.</font>

640
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,810
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Darn it.</font>

641
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,910
<font color="yellow">Hey, Hwa Shin.</font>

642
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:50,980
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

643
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,880
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Did rumour spread that it's you?</font>

644
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,150
<font color="yellow">Did you know about the rumour?</font>

645
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,880
<font color="yellow">Then why didn't you tell me?
Was I the last to find out?</font>

646
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,810
<font color="yellow">Just stay quiet.</font>

647
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,909
<font color="yellow">You may not get the full-time position.</font>

648
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,810
<font color="yellow">I don't think they'd decide
based on something like that.</font>

649
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,809
<font color="yellow">If I don't get it, it won't be
because I have breast cancer,</font>

650
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,650
<font color="yellow">but because I'm not good enough.</font>

651
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,350
<font color="yellow">So please just stay quiet.</font>

652
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,750
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

653
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,050
<font color="yellow">What am I doing to you?</font>

654
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,650
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

655
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,180
<font color="yellow">I want to keep watching you do the news.</font>

656
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,480
<font color="yellow">And it's not a big deal for a
woman to have breast cancer.</font>

woman to have breast cancer.</font>

658
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,810
<font color="yellow">It's the same thing. How
is it not a big deal?</font>

659
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,450
<font color="yellow">Did you know? Did you
date her when you knew?</font>

660
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,950
<font color="yellow">Na Ri isn't sick. She
isn't the one who's sick.</font>

661
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,350
<font color="yellow">I'll handle it.</font>

662
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,810
<font color="yellow">What will you handle?</font>

663
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,650
<font color="yellow">Is this how you handle things?</font>

664
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,610
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee.</font>

665
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,310
<font color="yellow">Hi. Have you had dinner?</font>

666
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,950
<font color="yellow">I have.</font>

667
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,180
<font color="yellow">It's time to stop...</font>

668
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,820
<font color="yellow">pretending to be the patient for me.</font>

669
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,150
<font color="yellow">I'm going to tell the company that
I'm the one with breast cancer.</font>

670
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,409
<font color="yellow">I'll tell them the fact that
you pretended to be sick...</font>

671
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,080
<font color="yellow">so that people wouldn't know.</font>

672
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,950
<font color="yellow">So keep that in mind.</font>

673
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,680
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare.</font>

674
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,550
<font color="yellow">I'll take a short break.</font>

675
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,880
<font color="yellow">You do, and I'll kill you.</font>

676
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,710
<font color="yellow">I'll let you kill me then.</font>

677
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,350
<font color="yellow">I won't see you.</font>

678
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,880
<font color="yellow">Don't see me.</font>

679
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,709
<font color="yellow">Let's break up.</font>

680
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,809
<font color="yellow">Yes. Let's break up.</font>

681
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,750
<font color="yellow">- It's really over.
- Yes. End it.</font>

682
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,950
<font color="yellow">It's for the better.</font>

683
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,180
<font color="yellow">Are you insane? Have you lost your mind?</font>

684
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,850
<font color="yellow">The rumour's out already. Just let it be.</font>

685
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,710
<font color="yellow">If people find out...</font>

686
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,649
<font color="yellow">that a man has breast cancer,</font>

687
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,380
<font color="yellow">imagine how differently they'd look at you.</font>

688
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:01,680
<font color="yellow">I'll do anything else you ask.
Okay? Come on, Mr Lee.</font>

689
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,350
<font color="yellow">Do as I say, okay?</font>

690
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,610
<font color="yellow">I like acting like the
patient in your place.</font>

691
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:12,610
<font color="yellow">I was happy because it gave
me a reason to be with you.</font>

- Yes, even now.</font>

693
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:18,379
<font color="yellow">Even now, when people talk
about you, stare at you...</font>

00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,880
<font color="yellow">and treat you uncomfortably,
mixed with pity and sympathy?</font>

695
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,310
<font color="yellow">Yes, even now.</font>

696
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,379
<font color="yellow">The lie that it's me is 100 times better...</font>

697
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,350
<font color="yellow">than the fact that it's you.</font>

698

<font color="yellow">Don't you dare.</font>

699
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,310
<font color="yellow">I'll go back to Jung Won.</font>

700
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,610
<font color="yellow">Are you afraid I won't make
full-time because I'm sick?</font>

701
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,680
<font color="yellow">I'll do better.</font>

702
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,880

at the desk all the time.</font>

<font color="yellow">People will forget in a year, right?</font>

729
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,510
<font color="yellow">- About what?
- Anything.</font>

730
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,080

- Anything.</font>

731

744
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,780
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you were late?
You should go.</font>

745
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,180
<font color="yellow">You should get to work. It's okay.</font>

754
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,180
<font color="yellow">Why? You watch it all the time.</font>

755

dinner, so make it for me.</font>

758
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:07,980
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

759
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,510
<font color="yellow">There's no fish at home.</font>

760
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,480
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly craving fish stew?</font>

761
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,810
<font color="yellow">Go out and buy some fish, then.</font>

762

in Korea was found in 1923.</font>

<font color="yellow">Since then, the number of patients
has been constantly growing.</font>

00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:29,750
<font color="yellow">Currently in 2016, there are
500 to 1,000 male patients,</font>

00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:33,480

00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:36,980
<font color="yellow">of the total number of
breast cancer patients.</font>

are luckier than others.</font>

793
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,110
<font color="yellow">Some find out about it at an early stage.</font>

794
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:52,580
<font color="yellow">Lee, a man in his 30s, had never
imagined he'd have breast cancer.</font>

795
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,650
<font color="yellow">It was a miracle that his cancer
was detected at an early stage.</font>

796
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:01,250
<font color="yellow">One day, someone pointed out
that he had a lump in his chest.</font>

797
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,980
<font color="yellow">It was stage-one breast cancer.</font>

798
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,480
<font color="yellow">If he had been unlucky,</font>

799
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,250
<font color="yellow">he would have found his
cancer at a later stage...</font>

800
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:13,610
<font color="yellow">as most other patients do, and
would have died helplessly.</font>

801
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:17,350
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you apply some ointment?</font>

802
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,480
<font color="yellow">It won't stop bleeding. My goodness.</font>

<font color="yellow">You might have breast cancer.</font>

806
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,180
<font color="yellow">If someone detected your
cancer before you did,</font>

807
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:35,480
<font color="yellow">you should be grateful to
that person all your life.</font>

808
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,610
<font color="yellow">If that person is your loved one,</font>

809
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,750
<font color="yellow">you must be a match made in heaven.</font>

810

<font color="yellow">You're also lucky...</font>

811
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,850
<font color="yellow">if your spouse or girlfriend
is aware of your illness.</font>

812
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,510
<font color="yellow">Many male breast cancer patients...</font>

813
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:57,450

814
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,450

<font color="yellow">that's always full of women...</font>

816
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,310
<font color="yellow">is something men dread of doing.</font>

817
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,079
<font color="yellow">Many male patients hesitate
before seeing a doctor...</font>

818
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,880
<font color="yellow">in fear of what other people
would think about them.</font>

819
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,180
<font color="yellow">This is how the examination works.</font>

820
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,080
<font color="yellow">The examination is even
more painful for men...</font>

821
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:23,910
<font color="yellow">because their chest mostly
consists of muscles.</font>

822
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,449
<font color="yellow">If your partner is not
aware of your cancer,</font>

823
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,950
<font color="yellow">you'll have to go through
the pain all alone.</font>

824
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,880
<font color="yellow">After the surgery,</font>

825
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:38,850
<font color="yellow">you need to wear a special
bra to stop the bleeding.</font>

826
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:45,350
<font color="yellow">However, can you imagine a
man buying this bra himself?</font>

827
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,810
<font color="yellow">Male breast cancer patients stand
out more than any other patients.</font>

828
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,580
<font color="yellow">Everyone gossips about them.</font>

829
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,450
<font color="yellow">Everyone stares at them.</font>

830
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,550
<font color="yellow">It is a battle that is too
difficult to fight alone.</font>

831
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:03,979
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, the patient's
spouse books an appointment...</font>

832
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,950
<font color="yellow">under her own name...</font>

833
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,180
<font color="yellow">to pretend as if she's the patient.</font>

834
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:14,010
<font color="yellow">She's taking the risk of being
gossiped about herself.</font>

835
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,180
<font color="yellow">That approach isn't always necessary,</font>

836
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:18,910
<font color="yellow">but if the male patient
feels too humiliated,</font>

837
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,350
<font color="yellow">it could be a way to help.</font>

838
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,979
<font color="yellow">If you detect your cancer
at an early stage,</font>

839
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,050
<font color="yellow">and if your partner
supports you, you're lucky.</font>

840
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:28,580
<font color="yellow">However, this miracle does not happen...</font>

841
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:32,580
<font color="yellow">to every male breast cancer patient.</font>

842
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,280
<font color="yellow">The most difficult part is that...</font>

843
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,180
<font color="yellow">you can never talk about
your illness to anyone.</font>

844
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,180
<font color="yellow">You have to continue working,
pretending to be healthy.</font>

845
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:46,050
<font color="yellow">You also keep it a secret if you're
afraid of losing your partner.</font>

846
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,450
<font color="yellow">That's because what they
fear the most is...</font>

847
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:50,950
<font color="yellow">not the pain, but the prejudice...</font>

848
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:52,950
<font color="yellow">that they're not manly.</font>

849
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,280
<font color="yellow">You might not believe this.</font>

850
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,180
<font color="yellow">I'm also a breast cancer patient.</font>

851
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:29,050
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

852
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,380
<font color="yellow">I found out at an early stage,
and my partner supported me.</font>

853
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,810
<font color="yellow">But I had to fight against
deep-rooted prejudice.</font>

854
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,610
<font color="yellow">I was in despair.</font>

855
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,650
<font color="yellow">I could not tell anyone
at work about my illness.</font>

856
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,250
<font color="yellow">I was afraid that...</font>

857
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:59,250
<font color="yellow">I might lose my position at work.</font>

858
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,710
<font color="yellow">But there was something more
important than my position.</font>

859
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,350
<font color="yellow">I lost a part of my chest,</font>

860
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:12,180
<font color="yellow">but in order to protect the person I love,</font>

861
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,510
