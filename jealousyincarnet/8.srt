<font color="yellow"><i>[Episode 8]</i>
Hwa Shin just set us up, right?</font>

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,894
<font color="yellow">He told us to give it a try.</font>

4
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:14,517
<font color="yellow">He did set us up, right?</font>

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,378
<font color="yellow">Yes, but it is kind of strange.</font>

6
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:18,439
<font color="yellow">What is?</font>

7
00:00:19,157 --> 00:00:21,332
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Lee and you.
- Me?</font>

8
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:25,065
<font color="yellow">Why would Reporter Lee tell me
to date his best friend?</font>

9
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:28,046
<font color="yellow">Also, why do you like me?</font>

10
00:00:29,294 --> 00:00:31,503
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm very lacking.</font>

11
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:33,025
<font color="yellow">It's weird.</font>

12
00:00:42,257 --> 00:00:45,423
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for the morning news,
you would've had soju.</font>

13
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,434
<font color="yellow">Yes, I would have.</font>

14
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,383
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll have soju.</font>

15
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:58,319
<font color="yellow">We've both had one shot of soju now.</font>

16
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:00,410
<font color="yellow">Let's each say one thing
we feel we're lacking in</font>

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,501
<font color="yellow">and do a plus-minus statement.</font>

18
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:05,249
<font color="yellow">We won't know who's more lacking
until we do a proper calculation.</font>

19
00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:07,097
<font color="yellow">- I'll go first.
- What?</font>

20
00:01:07,097 --> 00:01:11,614
<font color="yellow">I have less time than Pyo Na Ri.
My company takes up too much of my time.</font>

21
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:15,531
<font color="yellow">Why would I do something like this?
I'll feel worse the more we do.</font>

22
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:18,828
<font color="yellow">I can't even wear what I want.
I have to wear my company's clothes.</font>

23
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,668
<font color="yellow">I have so many other clothes
I want to wear.</font>

24
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:23,788
<font color="yellow">You can buy many other brands
and wear whatever you want.</font>

25
00:01:23,788 --> 00:01:26,793
<font color="yellow">Stop it. I don't want to do it anymore.</font>

26
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:29,225
<font color="yellow">You have a good boss like Hwa Shin.</font>

27
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:31,073
<font color="yellow">I don't have anyone
I can depend on at all.</font>

28
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:32,421
<font color="yellow">I have no one above me.</font>

29
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:34,540
<font color="yellow">It's really not good at all.
I have to take all the responsibility.</font>

30
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,228
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop now.</font>

31
00:01:36,715 --> 00:01:40,126
<font color="yellow">Do you really know me, Pyo Na Ri?</font>

32
00:01:41,346 --> 00:01:42,974
<font color="yellow">Is there any point to this?</font>

33
00:01:42,974 --> 00:01:45,802
<font color="yellow">See? I'm like a bum right now.</font>

34
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:47,722
<font color="yellow">I'm begging for affection.</font>

35
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:55,200
<font color="yellow">What is this, really?</font>

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,258
<font color="yellow">You argued with Hwa Shin
over 10,000 or 20,000 won</font>

37
00:01:58,258 --> 00:02:00,380
<font color="yellow">like your life was on the line.</font>

38
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,570
<font color="yellow">Why? You should be like that with me.</font>

39
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,618
<font color="yellow">We should get going now.</font>

40
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:08,121
<font color="yellow">So? The results?</font>

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,269
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll pay today, okay?</font>

42
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:14,715
<font color="yellow">Happy now?</font>

43
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,891
<font color="yellow">How much?</font>

44
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:18,488
<font color="yellow">58,000 won.</font>

45
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:30,218
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you really know me, Pyo Na Ri?</i></font>

46
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:32,136
<font color="yellow">I'm like a bum right now.</font>

47
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:33,727
<font color="yellow">I'm begging for affection.</font>

48
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,669
<font color="yellow">- Did you take Pyo Na Ri back?
- Yes.</font>

49
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,661
<font color="yellow">- What did she say?
- About what?</font>

50
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:15,893
<font color="yellow">She's playing hard to get.</font>

51
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:21,072
<font color="yellow">I must not be attractive.
She keeps playing hard to get.</font>

52
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:23,153
<font color="yellow">You even tried to set us up.</font>

53
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:30,839
<font color="yellow">How long have you been
interested in Pyo Na Ri?</font>

54
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:34,029
<font color="yellow">How long has it been?</font>

55
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:39,620
<font color="yellow">Since the flight to Thailand?</font>

56
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:42,929
<font color="yellow">You flew together?</font>

57
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:44,310
<font color="yellow">It was by chance.</font>

58
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:50,555
<font color="yellow">She was sitting in my seat
as if it were her seat.</font>

59
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:55,138
<font color="yellow">It was very obvious that
it was her first time flying.</font>

60
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:59,276
<font color="yellow"><i>She said she felt like
her head was in the clouds.</i></font>

61
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:04,096
<font color="yellow">Wow. I feel like my head is the clouds.</font>

62
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:06,726
<font color="yellow">She was like a kid at a picnic.</font>

63
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:11,647
<font color="yellow">I pretended to sleep with
a newspaper on my face.</font>

64
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:14,447
<font color="yellow">She was just staring at me.</font>

65
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:19,954
<font color="yellow">I was sitting alone in first class
on my flight back.</font>

66
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,928
<font color="yellow">But then I thought of the girl
with her head in the clouds.</font>

67
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:29,253
<font color="yellow"><i>Please call the station
if I get the weather wrong.</i></font>

68
00:04:29,255 --> 00:04:30,598
<font color="yellow"><i>You have to. You must.</i></font>

69
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:34,144
<font color="yellow">You can complain, curse, and get angry.</font>

70
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:36,411
<font color="yellow">It's been my dream
to get a call like that.</font>

71
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:41,772
<font color="yellow">I thought it would be nice
if she were sitting next to me.</font>

72
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,259
<font color="yellow">I just kept thinking that.</font>

73
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:00,589
<font color="yellow">Be good to her.</font>

74
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,541
<font color="yellow">I told you she's playing hard to get.</font>

75
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,324
<font color="yellow">She won't be able to last long.
Pyo Na Ri's not very good at that.</font>

76
00:05:06,324 --> 00:05:08,558
<font color="yellow">- How do you know?
- I just know.</font>

77
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:12,286
<font color="yellow">I wonder what she likes.</font>

78
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,219
<font color="yellow">What kind of guy does she like?</font>

79
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:20,469
<font color="yellow">Do you know when her
last relationship was?</font>

80
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,848
<font color="yellow">Don't care about that stuff
and just be good to her.</font>

81
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:27,815
<font color="yellow">Also, don't come here tomorrow.</font>

82
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,673
<font color="yellow">I'm going to move into Red's house soon.</font>

83
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:34,933
<font color="yellow">She's alone in my brother's place.
She'll get into trouble.</font>

84
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,536
<font color="yellow">I might not be able to
replace my brother.</font>

85
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,336
<font color="yellow">But I'll try to mimic being a dad,
at least until Red gets married.</font>

86
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:44,534
<font color="yellow">That's downstairs from Pyo Na Ri's place.</font>

87
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:10,875
<font color="yellow"><i>[Lee Joong Shin]</i>
Joong Shin.</font>

88
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:15,295
<font color="yellow">I'll hold on to your will for now.</font>

89
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,510
<font color="yellow">I'm still not sure who will
be a better mom to Red.</font>

90
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,534
<font color="yellow">May I watch over them for a bit?</font>

91
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:24,918
<font color="yellow">I can do that, right?</font>

92
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:32,680
<font color="yellow">How can we have such similar tastes?</font>

93
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,832
<font color="yellow">Whether it's food,
clothes, or even men...</font>

94
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:39,022
<font color="yellow">You both even hate me too, right?</font>

95
00:06:40,361 --> 00:06:42,223
<font color="yellow">Keep talking. Go on.</font>

96
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:46,921
<font color="yellow">How much condolence money
did you give at the funeral anyway?</font>

97
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:51,642
<font color="yellow">I had money saved away for Red.
I gave that too.</font>

98
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:04,327
<font color="yellow">I need to get those two
married off again.</font>

99
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:08,479
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't they have let
some things go by that age?</font>

100
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:28,063
<font color="yellow">Are you going to report on a story
looking like this?</font>

101
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:29,716
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get an exclusive.</font>

102
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:33,651
<font color="yellow">Have you ever seen someone tell
their competition where they're going?</font>

103
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:35,620
<font color="yellow">You should give up
on the 9 p.m. anchor spot.</font>

104
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,125
<font color="yellow">You'll just get hurt competing with me.</font>

105
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,726
<font color="yellow">Also, no woman has ever done it.</font>

106
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,248
<font color="yellow">You can follow me if you're curious.</font>

107
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:44,728
<font color="yellow">I'll be in the mountains yelling "Yahoo!"</font>

108
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:56,767
<font color="yellow">Mister, let's unload here.</font>

109
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:59,947
<font color="yellow">Oh, what is that?</font>

110
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:05,570
<font color="yellow">Mister, you can't park here.
Where are you moving to?</font>

111
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,712
<font color="yellow">The third floor there.</font>

112
00:08:06,712 --> 00:08:09,274
<font color="yellow">Oh my! Here?</font>

113
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:17,745
<font color="yellow">Unload mine first to the third floor,
I'll pay you three times the amount.</font>

114
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:19,793
<font color="yellow">Okay, go!</font>

115
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:22,522
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- Everyone, move fast!</font>

116
00:08:22,522 --> 00:08:24,887
<font color="yellow">Get mine unloaded now!</font>

117
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:45,020
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- Move out of the way!</font>

118
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:48,759
<font color="yellow">You people are just too much!</font>

119
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:51,646
<font color="yellow">This is breaking and entering!</font>

120
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:54,850
<font color="yellow">It's my brother's house.
Mister, move the truck!</font>

121
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,233
<font color="yellow">You don't have Red's permission.
What are you doing?</font>

122
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:59,814
<font color="yellow">Even I'm waiting for Red to be ready
so I can move in.</font>

123
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:02,866
<font color="yellow">Mister, move this out. Move it out!</font>

124
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,406
<font color="yellow">Hey! Why would he?</font>

125
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:05,608
<font color="yellow">Bring it up.</font>

126
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:08,450
<font color="yellow">- Bring it down. Don't go up.
- Why bring it down?</font>

127
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,270
<font color="yellow">Mister, no! Go up.</font>

128
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,860
<font color="yellow">- Up, up, up!
- Bring it down.</font>

129
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,401
<font color="yellow">Bring it down. Hey!</font>

130
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:18,546
<font color="yellow">I told you to bring the thing down.</font>

131
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:21,267
<font color="yellow">Hey, get off of my bed now!</font>

132
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:24,502
<font color="yellow">Hey, Mister! There's a person on it.
Why are you moving it up?</font>

133
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:26,287
<font color="yellow">It's dangerous. Get off.</font>

134
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:29,002
<font color="yellow">- I'll pay you three times the amount.
- Gosh, seriously?</font>

135
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,315
<font color="yellow">Go up. Keep going up!</font>

136
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:33,075
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

137
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:34,151
<font color="yellow">Why is this bed so big?</font>

138
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:36,045
<font color="yellow">You're going to put this
in that tiny house?</font>

139
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:38,748
<font color="yellow">- Get off. It's my bed!
- Seriously...</font>

140
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:41,421
<font color="yellow">The mountain you spoke of
was on the third floor?</font>

141
00:09:41,421 --> 00:09:44,083
<font color="yellow">The third floor is a mountain to you?
You were going to shout "Yahoo"?</font>

142
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,882
<font color="yellow">Okay, I won't ever let you
shout "Yahoo" from here.</font>

143
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:48,282
<font color="yellow">I won't let any of you do it!</font>

144
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:50,508
<font color="yellow">I'll shout "Yahoo." I'll shout it.</font>

145
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:53,751
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sleep in this bed with Red.
I'll shout "Yahoo!"</font>

146
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:57,440
<font color="yellow">If you got divorced,
sleep in this bed with another man!</font>

147
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,791
<font color="yellow">Gosh, just get off the bed.</font>

148
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,980
<font color="yellow">What a hit.</font>

149
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:05,033
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, please take these utensils
and plates up first.</font>

150
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:07,026
<font color="yellow">Please hurry up.</font>

151
00:10:07,026 --> 00:10:09,489
<font color="yellow">Mister, take this rice cooker
and those kinds of things up.</font>

152
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:11,609
<font color="yellow">Can you take my makeup stand
up the stairs?</font>

153
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:13,540
<font color="yellow">Please use the stairs.</font>

154
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,319
<font color="yellow">I'll pay you three times the price,
even if it's harder.</font>

155
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,299
<font color="yellow">Why are you so strong?</font>

156
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,526
<font color="yellow">Get out of here.</font>

157
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:23,945
<font color="yellow">Mister, no! That one is not mine.</font>

158
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:27,546
<font color="yellow">That one is Kye Sung Sook's.
Why would you move that?</font>

159
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:31,455
<font color="yellow">If you see anything of hers up there,
throw it out the window.</font>

160
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:42,191
<font color="yellow">Just get out of here! No, you can't.</font>

161
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:44,989
<font color="yellow">Get that bed down.</font>

162
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:47,300
<font color="yellow">This lady is seriously...</font>

163
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,440
<font color="yellow">Put me down!</font>

164
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:52,291
<font color="yellow">Stay right here.</font>

165
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,060
<font color="yellow">That... woman is Bang Ja Young, right?</font>

166
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,381
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Kye Sung Sook? Hwa Shin?</font>

167
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:00,473
<font color="yellow">Sis, just go home.</font>

168
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:05,834
<font color="yellow">- What was that?
- Hey!</font>

169
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,546
<font color="yellow">Now you're throwing things?</font>

170
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:09,354
<font color="yellow">Really, what in the world?</font>

171
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:14,075
<font color="yellow">Life would be over for any man
caught by those women.</font>

172
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:15,993
<font color="yellow">They are really scary, right?</font>

173
00:11:15,994 --> 00:11:19,876
<font color="yellow">They're my juniors,
but I didn't know they were like that.</font>

174
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:24,550
<font color="yellow">You'd better not ever
hang around those women.</font>

175
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,540
<font color="yellow">Let go, let go.</font>

176
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,441
<font color="yellow">Gosh, are you serious?</font>

177
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:30,997
<font color="yellow">You can't go in.</font>

178
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:34,825
<font color="yellow">This is the kimchi.</font>

179
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:36,463
<font color="yellow">- Move.
- No, no.</font>

180
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:40,117
<font color="yellow">Hey, move.
This is the kimchi that Red likes.</font>

181
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,275
<font color="yellow">Let go! Where do you think you're going?</font>

182
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:44,498
<font color="yellow">There's only one room.
Where do you think you're going?</font>

183
00:11:44,498 --> 00:11:47,752
<font color="yellow">- Where do you think you're going?
- Red likes this kimchi!</font>

184
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:50,281
<font color="yellow">You people are crazy!</font>

185
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,595
<font color="yellow">Oh no, my kimchi.</font>

186
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:10,881
<font color="yellow">Kimchi...</font>

187
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:14,397
<font color="yellow">It's all really fermented.</font>

188
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:43,674
<font color="yellow">This is the real estate office, right?</font>

189
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:46,977
<font color="yellow">Is there anything in that neighborhood
near Rak Pasta Villa?</font>

190
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:48,515
<font color="yellow">I don't care what it is.</font>

191
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:51,592
<font color="yellow">Please find anything quickly, right away.</font>

192
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,373
<font color="yellow">Thank you very much.</font>

193
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,666
<font color="yellow">Sis, you're going to die at this rate.</font>

194
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,276
<font color="yellow">You kicked Hwa Shin out
and you're not eating anything.</font>

195
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:08,068
<font color="yellow">Are you going to die here all alone?</font>

196
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:12,252
<font color="yellow">Just go.</font>

197
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:14,603
<font color="yellow">Didn't Hwa Shin say anything to you?</font>

198
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:20,583
<font color="yellow">Your daughter-in-laws, Kye Sung Sook and
Bang Ja Young moved into Red's house.</font>

199
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:23,795
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

200
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:26,655
<font color="yellow">Those little...</font>

201
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:34,609
<font color="yellow">I thought about it all night.</font>

202
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,493
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make Red my girl.</font>

203
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:39,642
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

204
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:43,792
<font color="yellow">You're not even going to
think about it for one second?</font>

205
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:46,406
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?</font>

206
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:50,147
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you worry and
think about it for a night too?</font>

207
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:54,906
<font color="yellow">Red kissed you too.</font>

208
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:57,496
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

209
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:00,550
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

210
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:09,485
<font color="yellow">How does it feel living with two moms?</font>

211
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:13,435
<font color="yellow">It feels similar to kissing two guys.</font>

212
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:20,498
<font color="yellow">Aren't you guys even jealous?</font>

213
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,778
<font color="yellow">Is that what you wanted?</font>

214
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:29,709
<font color="yellow">Mostly from you.</font>

215
00:14:30,998 --> 00:14:33,179
<font color="yellow">Red, you are really a mean girl.</font>

216
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:35,828
<font color="yellow">She doesn't like either of us.</font>

217
00:14:35,828 --> 00:14:38,506
<font color="yellow">No, Red likes both of us.</font>

218
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:42,179
<font color="yellow">If a girl has someone she likes,
she won't kiss a guy she doesn't like.</font>

219
00:14:47,602 --> 00:14:48,940
<font color="yellow"><i>I want to see you for a bit.</i></font>

220
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,912
<font color="yellow"><i>Dress code is tight short shorts
and a belly t-shirt.</i></font>

221
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,436
<font color="yellow">You're not wearing a belly t-shirt.</font>

222
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:25,546
<font color="yellow">I felt a little strange wearing one
at this hour on the bus.</font>

223
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:32,853
<font color="yellow">Let's do this quickly and play.</font>

224
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:35,066
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

225
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,987
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

226
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:47,294
<font color="yellow">The key point in a one piece
is the waist.</font>

227
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:49,542
<font color="yellow">It has to be precise,
down to a tenth of an inch.</font>

228
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:52,891
<font color="yellow">You don't have the hips of an ant.</font>

229
00:15:53,762 --> 00:15:56,347
<font color="yellow">What is it? What are you doing?</font>

230
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:58,309
<font color="yellow">I'm sponsoring your clothes, remember?</font>

231
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:05,911
<font color="yellow">Your arms are long like a monkey's.</font>

232
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:09,041
<font color="yellow">I'm a size 55.
I fit into anything that's a 55.</font>

233
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,252
<font color="yellow">You're no longer a size 55.</font>

234
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:13,886
<font color="yellow">You're going to wear a Pyo Na Ri size.</font>

235
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:17,387
<font color="yellow">Not sizes like 55 or 66
like other people.</font>

236
00:16:17,907 --> 00:16:19,897
<font color="yellow">It'll be the only one in the world.</font>

237
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:23,816
<font color="yellow">Only one, Pyo Na Ri size.</font>

238
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,984
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri size?</font>

239
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:33,086
<font color="yellow">When we do fitting measurements,
it's best to wear very little.</font>

240
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:35,897
<font color="yellow">- Don't get the wrong idea.
- I'm not.</font>

241
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,200
<font color="yellow">How long will this take?</font>

242
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:14,421
<font color="yellow">I'll do the shoes. I'll do it.</font>

243
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:17,729
<font color="yellow">Even if it's only 60 seconds,
you have to stand.</font>

244
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:20,809
<font color="yellow">You have to wear better shoes
than the announcers who are sitting.</font>

245
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:36,688
<font color="yellow">For bodies like yours that are skinny
with long arms like monkeys</font>

246
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:39,142
<font color="yellow">you have to use clothes to create curves.</font>

247
00:18:39,142 --> 00:18:41,043
<font color="yellow">It creates more femininity.</font>

248
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:45,763
<font color="yellow">It's pretty.</font>

249
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:47,341
<font color="yellow">So, you like it?</font>

250
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:49,750
<font color="yellow">I do like it.</font>

251
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,739
<font color="yellow">Raise your arms.</font>

252
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:56,325
<font color="yellow">Some more.</font>

253
00:18:57,633 --> 00:19:00,334
<font color="yellow">Sorry, sorry. Don't move.</font>

254
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:03,035
<font color="yellow">There are pins everywhere. Sorry.</font>

255
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:06,014
<font color="yellow">From now on, don't leave my sight.</font>

256
00:19:16,274 --> 00:19:20,657
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why isn't she coming home yet?
Look at the time.</font>

257
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,083
<font color="yellow">Is she out doing something bad again?</font>

258
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,668
<font color="yellow">This is why she needs to
live with her mom.</font>

259
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:29,326
<font color="yellow">- This is why I--
- Shh.</font>

260
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:44,971
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

261
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:46,702
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

262
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:55,593
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

263
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,682
<font color="yellow">This is the phone you left, right?
It seems just fine.</font>

264
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:11,270
<font color="yellow">It shouldn't be.</font>

265
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,616
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

266
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,409
<font color="yellow">Oh, it really is. Oh my.</font>

267
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,488
<font color="yellow">Even the videos of Reporter Lee
are still okay.</font>

268
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,591
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- Let's go to the hospital.</font>

269
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:42,802
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
- Let go.</font>

270
00:20:42,802 --> 00:20:44,845
<font color="yellow">- Let's just go.
- Let go.</font>

271
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:45,918
<font color="yellow">Just go.</font>

272
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:48,508
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it myself so let go.</font>

273
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:51,365
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

274
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:56,373
<font color="yellow">Your surgery wound is healed now.</font>

275
00:20:56,373 --> 00:20:59,173
<font color="yellow">You'll be in trouble if you
delay this any longer.</font>

276
00:20:59,173 --> 00:21:01,114
<font color="yellow">My mom delayed it because
she had a store.</font>

277
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:05,677
<font color="yellow">She refused to close for even a day,
delayed it, and got worse.</font>

278
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:09,633
<font color="yellow">Later on, she ended up passing away.</font>

279
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:12,933
<font color="yellow">Don't you have a date with Jung Won?</font>

280
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:15,455
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of that.</font>

281
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,047
<font color="yellow">What about your post-op bra?</font>

282
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:26,373
<font color="yellow">Oh my! What are they doing?</font>

283
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:29,855
<font color="yellow">Do you have the bra on?</font>

284
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:36,613
<font color="yellow">Hey, get over here.</font>

285
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:39,693
<font color="yellow">I went to my appointments and
got my dressing changed all the time.</font>

286
00:21:39,693 --> 00:21:42,081
<font color="yellow">I don't need my post-op bra
anymore and I'm fine.</font>

287
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:43,592
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

288
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:46,585
<font color="yellow">Don't touch my body.</font>

289
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:49,639
<font color="yellow">It's my chest.</font>

290
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:53,179
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it like its yours,
and don't fondle it.</font>

291
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,788
<font color="yellow">Please stop worrying it.</font>

292
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:57,159
<font color="yellow">I can't stop so what can I do?</font>

293
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:59,420
<font color="yellow">Do you think I want to be doing this?</font>

294
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,699
<font color="yellow">I don't even want to
see you anymore either.</font>

295
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:03,212
<font color="yellow">Then don't.</font>

296
00:22:03,212 --> 00:22:07,203
<font color="yellow">But you're ignoring your own chest.</font>

297
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:10,011
<font color="yellow">It's your chest and
you're treating it so poorly.</font>

298
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:14,430
<font color="yellow">When I think about your chest,
it reminds me of my mom.</font>

299
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:22,141
<font color="yellow">Can't you just let me
take care of your chest?</font>

300
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:47,824
<font color="yellow">Do I smell like kimchi, by any chance?</font>

301
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,384
<font color="yellow">No, you don't.</font>

302
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:54,004
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

303
00:22:54,004 --> 00:22:56,150
<font color="yellow">Before the public recruitment</font>

304
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,419
<font color="yellow">people are saying that all the
anchors may be shuffled around.</font>

305
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:01,238
<font color="yellow">I've heard about that.</font>

306
00:23:01,238 --> 00:23:03,359
<font color="yellow">There will be an announcement
about the audition soon.</font>

307
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,706
<font color="yellow">I think you should go for the 9 p.m.
that Announcer Geum is doing.</font>

308
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:11,392
<font color="yellow">The moment that Kye Sung Sook
becomes the main anchor for 9 p.m.</font>

309
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,328
<font color="yellow">will be the end of us announcers.</font>

310
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,690
<font color="yellow">Why is that, Chief?</font>

311
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,716
<font color="yellow">If the main anchor is a female reporter</font>

312
00:23:17,716 --> 00:23:21,356
<font color="yellow">then who would sit next to her in a seat
traditionally held by female announcers?</font>

313
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:23,407
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't just be any male announcer.</font>

314
00:23:23,407 --> 00:23:26,078
<font color="yellow">It would be a good looking,
male reporter with a bright future.</font>

315
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:30,274
<font color="yellow">The reporters will take all the
announcer seats and we'll all disappear.</font>

316
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:33,277
<font color="yellow">That can never happen.
We can't let it happen.</font>

317
00:23:46,177 --> 00:23:48,122
<font color="yellow">Should I drive? I'll drive.</font>

318
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:49,629
<font color="yellow">Just get in the car.</font>

319
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,922
<font color="yellow">Why would you drive my car?</font>

320
00:23:53,355 --> 00:23:55,303
<font color="yellow">- Get in.
- I can open the door.</font>

321
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,940
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

322
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:03,749
<font color="yellow">Hey, are they dating?</font>

323
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:07,209
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri was touching
Reporter Lee's chest before, right?</font>

324
00:24:07,209 --> 00:24:10,486
<font color="yellow">I mean it wasn't just anyone,
but Reporter Lee's chest?</font>

325
00:24:10,486 --> 00:24:13,952
<font color="yellow">I think it's obvious that Pyo Na Ri
is throwing herself at him again.</font>

326
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,716
<font color="yellow">She is really persistent.</font>

327
00:24:15,716 --> 00:24:19,173
<font color="yellow">She had a one-sided crush on him
four years ago and it's still ongoing?</font>

328
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:20,430
<font color="yellow">Still?</font>

329
00:24:23,524 --> 00:24:27,624
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee Hwa Shin will be going
after the 9 p.m. anchor spot too.</font>

330
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:30,103
<font color="yellow">He'll be butting heads
with Kye Sung Sook.</font>

331
00:24:30,898 --> 00:24:32,729
<font color="yellow">You need to use that to your advantage.</font>

332
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:41,775
<font color="yellow">Don't laugh.</font>

333
00:24:42,976 --> 00:24:46,478
<font color="yellow">They say radiation takes
only 5 to 10 minutes.</font>

334
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:50,996
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat. I'm hungry.</font>

335
00:24:51,517 --> 00:24:54,867
<font color="yellow">Why? We have to go to the hospital.</font>

336
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,238
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

337
00:24:56,238 --> 00:24:57,710
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

338
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,710
<font color="yellow">I haven't eaten all day.</font>

339
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,451
<font color="yellow">We can eat after we go to the hospital.
We can do that.</font>

340
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:04,818
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you something good.</font>

341
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:06,946
<font color="yellow">- Eat first.
- Hospital first.</font>

342
00:25:06,946 --> 00:25:08,614
<font color="yellow">Eat first!</font>

343
00:25:08,614 --> 00:25:10,054
<font color="yellow">Stop the car.</font>

344
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:12,882
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and stop the car.</font>

345
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:19,007
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

346
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:23,673
<font color="yellow">I've been very mentally stressed out
since yesterday, okay?</font>

347
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:31,498
<font color="yellow">Let's have beef rib stew.</font>

348
00:25:35,196 --> 00:25:38,345
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why aren't you listening to me?</font>

349
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:39,706
<font color="yellow">Seriously!</font>

350
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:42,448
<font color="yellow">Am I doing this for my sake?
Is this for my own chest?</font>

351
00:25:42,448 --> 00:25:45,784
<font color="yellow">Are you going through puberty,
menopause, or what?</font>

352
00:25:45,784 --> 00:25:47,296
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting like this?</font>

353
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,617
<font color="yellow">Why won't you just listen to me?</font>

354
00:25:50,347 --> 00:25:54,337
<font color="yellow">If you keep acting this way,
I'm going to tell your best friend.</font>

355
00:25:54,337 --> 00:25:57,767
<font color="yellow">You're going to get dragged
to the hospital like this.</font>

356
00:25:57,767 --> 00:26:01,448
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to deal with this secret
all on my own and suffer?</font>

357
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:02,651
<font color="yellow">Why should I?</font>

358
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:07,547
<font color="yellow">I think I'm so frustrated by you that
I don't think I'll live out my full life.</font>

359
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:11,587
<font color="yellow">You know what? Forget it. Just die.</font>

360
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:14,059
<font color="yellow">Just die quickly. I don't know.</font>

361
00:26:15,024 --> 00:26:16,901
<font color="yellow">I have to audition
to be the 9 p.m. anchor.</font>

362
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:19,240
<font color="yellow">- Let me go.
- If...</font>

363
00:26:20,832 --> 00:26:26,231
<font color="yellow">If people find out I have breast cancer,
it's game over for me.</font>

364
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:32,715
<font color="yellow">That place is like a ladies locker room.</font>

365
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:34,673
<font color="yellow">I have to go every day
for six to eight weeks</font>

366
00:26:34,673 --> 00:26:35,959
<font color="yellow">so how can we keep it quiet?</font>

367
00:26:36,732 --> 00:26:40,412
<font color="yellow">I know Reporter Kye and the other
competitors will come at me like hyenas.</font>

368
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:43,963
<font color="yellow">They will tear into me like a
piece of meat and spread rumors.</font>

369
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:47,707
<font color="yellow">Does it make sense to have a
male anchor who had breast cancer?</font>

370
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:49,975
<font color="yellow">People will laugh behind my back.</font>

371
00:26:51,393 --> 00:26:54,929
<font color="yellow">I have to become the
9 p.m. anchor this time.</font>

372
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:57,167
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure no rumors arise.</font>

373
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,507
<font color="yellow">Then it's okay, right?</font>

374
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:01,426
<font color="yellow">Forget it if you don't want to.</font>

375
00:27:16,404 --> 00:27:17,726
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri?</font>

376
00:27:17,726 --> 00:27:19,325
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm Pyo Na Ri!</font>

377
00:27:19,325 --> 00:27:20,711
<font color="yellow">- Come on in.
- Okay.</font>

378
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,746
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

379
00:27:31,738 --> 00:27:35,298
<font color="yellow">Your hair is... a little...</font>

380
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:37,686
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't touch me.</font>

381
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:47,046
<font color="yellow">You just heard, right?
They called in Pyo Na Ri.</font>

382
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:50,171
<font color="yellow">You were so sensitive about rumors.</font>

383
00:27:50,171 --> 00:27:53,576
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri and I discussed it and
came up with special measures.</font>

384
00:27:53,576 --> 00:27:57,948
<font color="yellow">Your name will be Pyo Na Ri from now on.</font>

385
00:27:58,407 --> 00:28:02,116
<font color="yellow">In the waiting area, radiation
treatment room, and dressing room.</font>

386
00:28:02,116 --> 00:28:09,180
<font color="yellow">Even in the imaging rooms,
your name will be Pyo Na Ri.</font>

387
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,275
<font color="yellow">When they call in Pyo Na Ri,
you need to come in as her guardian.</font>

388
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:15,738
<font color="yellow">You just pretend to be a guardian.</font>

389
00:28:15,738 --> 00:28:17,803
<font color="yellow">You're not going to have
issues with this, are you?</font>

390
00:28:18,408 --> 00:28:21,750
<font color="yellow">Then people will say that
Pyo Na Ri has breast cancer.</font>

391
00:28:23,807 --> 00:28:25,598
<font color="yellow">It's just stage one.</font>

392
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:30,439
<font color="yellow">You're stage one so people will say
that I have stage one cancer.</font>

393
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:36,168
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's not so great to say that
I'm getting radiation therapy, but...</font>

394
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:38,830
<font color="yellow">You should bow down
in gratitude to Pyo Na Ri.</font>

395
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,013
<font color="yellow">I don't like that either.</font>

396
00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:42,423
<font color="yellow">She is on the news too.</font>

397
00:28:42,423 --> 00:28:44,286
<font color="yellow">She says she's okay with it.</font>

398
00:28:44,286 --> 00:28:46,870
<font color="yellow">That's why I told you not to
do the partial removal</font>

399
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,296
<font color="yellow">and do complete removal!</font>

400
00:28:50,152 --> 00:28:54,477
<font color="yellow">Reporter, it's stage one cancer
and even with partial removal</font>

401
00:28:54,477 --> 00:28:57,962
<font color="yellow">people make a complete recovery
with radiation therapy.</font>

402
00:28:57,962 --> 00:28:59,353
<font color="yellow">Most women know that.</font>

403
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:04,029
<font color="yellow">Even if people mistakenly think
that I do have breast cancer</font>

404
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:05,426
<font color="yellow">I don't mind that.</font>

405
00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:07,649
<font color="yellow">You just need to get better,
Reporter Lee.</font>

406
00:29:09,988 --> 00:29:11,840
<font color="yellow">All right? Okay?</font>

407
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,180
<font color="yellow">You're the one getting the radiation.</font>

408
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,987
<font color="yellow">You're the one going through a hard time.</font>

409
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:19,369
<font color="yellow">It's not like we're
actually switching places.</font>

410
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:22,246
<font color="yellow">I'm only pretending
to have breast cancer.</font>

411
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:23,507
<font color="yellow">What's hard about that?</font>

412
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:25,893
<font color="yellow">You have to pretend
to be my guardian too.</font>

413
00:29:25,893 --> 00:29:31,248
<font color="yellow">Also, they say your skin will get
damaged a bit when you get radiation.</font>

414
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:34,899
<font color="yellow">Pretending is so easy. I'll be fine.</font>

415
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:41,573
<font color="yellow">When I see this couple,
I think the woman loves the man more.</font>

416
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:45,805
<font color="yellow">The man should be more like
the woman in a relationship.</font>

417
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:49,153
<font color="yellow">We're really not a couple, Doctor.</font>

418
00:29:49,153 --> 00:29:51,082
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you're not?</font>

419
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:54,292
<font color="yellow">I... saw you two kissing.</font>

420
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:57,447
<font color="yellow">Oh my... oh.</font>

421
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:02,876
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you telling them
it's not true?</font>

422
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:06,408
<font color="yellow">You're a lucky guy, Reporter Lee.</font>

423
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:09,488
<font color="yellow">Where will you find
another girl like this?</font>

424
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:18,949
<font color="yellow">We really aren't together, Doctor.</font>

425
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:24,933
<font color="yellow">Okay, why don't you get a CT
and start with the markings?</font>

426
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:34,016
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri?</font>

427
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:35,134
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's me.</font>

428
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:36,615
<font color="yellow">- Come in.
- Okay.</font>

429
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:06,913
<font color="yellow">Please don't move.</font>

430
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:13,033
<font color="yellow"><i>You have to come in every day for six
to eight weeks for radiation treatment.</i></font>

431
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:15,573
<font color="yellow"><i>Just the area of skin
receiving radiation will burn.</i></font>

432
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:20,594
<font color="yellow"><i>So, you must stay away from anything
that irritates the skin, like saunas.</i></font>

433
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:24,708
<font color="yellow">We will need to check your leukocyte
and blood platelet levels once a week.</font>

434
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:26,880
<font color="yellow">Make sure to get blood work done.</font>

435
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,167
<font color="yellow">Stay away from pork belly and dairy.</font>

436
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:32,680
<font color="yellow">Of course, no alcohol or cigarettes.</font>

437
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,429
<font color="yellow"><i>Pyo Na Ri, you are young.</i></font>

438
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:40,418
<font color="yellow"><i>That means cancer can relapse and spread
very quickly, so don't ever forget that.</i></font>

439
00:31:42,297 --> 00:31:44,677
<font color="yellow"><i>Please answer, Pyo Na Ri.</i></font>

440
00:31:46,056 --> 00:31:47,549
<font color="yellow"><i>Pyo Na Ri?</i></font>

441
00:31:54,975 --> 00:31:57,596
<font color="yellow">- Pyo Na Ri?
- Yes.</font>

442
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:09,976
<font color="yellow">Are you really okay with it?</font>

443
00:32:11,046 --> 00:32:13,396
<font color="yellow">Just do a good job
pretending to be my guardian.</font>

444
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:20,085
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you hungry?
- <i>Let's eat.</i></font>

445
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:24,316
<font color="yellow">Do you want to eat something?</font>

446
00:32:25,597 --> 00:32:27,114
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat.</font>

447
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:28,947
<font color="yellow">I have plans.</font>

448
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:35,921
<font color="yellow">They're with Go Jung Won.
Do you want to go eat with us?</font>

449
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,030
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to eat with us?
- No, you guys can go.</font>

450
00:32:46,822 --> 00:32:49,043
<font color="yellow">What are you eating...
what's on the menu?</font>

451
00:32:57,957 --> 00:32:59,106
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

452
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:03,148
<font color="yellow">I wasn't able to make it to
your brother's funeral.</font>

453
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,566
<font color="yellow">Here you go. I'm sorry.</font>

454
00:33:06,657 --> 00:33:07,856
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

455
00:33:08,356 --> 00:33:11,649
<font color="yellow">I heard that you are
best friends with Go Jung Won.</font>

456
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:15,444
<font color="yellow">Once he and I get married,
we should see each other often. Bye.</font>

457
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,248
<font color="yellow"><i>[Go Jung Won]</i></font>

458
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,217
<font color="yellow">- Where are you?
- With Pyo Na Ri.</font>

459
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,833
<font color="yellow">It's Hwa Shin.</font>

460
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:43,197
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten yet?</font>

461
00:33:44,465 --> 00:33:45,683
<font color="yellow">Not yet?</font>

462
00:33:47,664 --> 00:33:49,168
<font color="yellow">Do you trust me?</font>

463
00:33:49,168 --> 00:33:50,524
<font color="yellow">I trust you.</font>

464
00:33:52,373 --> 00:33:54,035
<font color="yellow">I don't trust you.</font>

465
00:33:58,845 --> 00:34:00,245
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your food.</font>

466
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:01,523
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

467
00:34:07,341 --> 00:34:08,888
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

468
00:34:10,178 --> 00:34:11,718
<font color="yellow">He must trust me.</font>

469
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:14,558
<font color="yellow">I know because he said
he doesn't trust me.</font>

470
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:30,788
<font color="yellow">Have you two ever fought before?</font>

471
00:34:30,788 --> 00:34:32,053
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

472
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:36,493
<font color="yellow">I wonder who would win.</font>

473
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:39,013
<font color="yellow">It depends on whose side you take.</font>

474
00:34:43,406 --> 00:34:44,997
<font color="yellow">We have no reason to fight.</font>

475
00:34:44,997 --> 00:34:46,189
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

476
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,725
<font color="yellow">did you get your hair done?</font>

477
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:53,263
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

478
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:56,761
<font color="yellow">Bon appetit, Chief.</font>

479
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,908
<font color="yellow">Yes, let's eat.</font>

480
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:10,957
<font color="yellow"><i>Reporter Lee Hwa Shin will be
going after the 9 p.m. anchor spot too.</i></font>

481
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:13,457
<font color="yellow"><i>He'll be butting heads
with Kye Sung Sook.</i></font>

482
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:16,393
<font color="yellow">Good job, everyone.</font>

483
00:35:16,393 --> 00:35:18,261
<font color="yellow">Good work!</font>

484
00:35:19,843 --> 00:35:22,861
<font color="yellow">I thought I was going to throw up
because of his bad breath.</font>

485
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:25,000
<font color="yellow">What the heck did he eat?</font>

486
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,575
<font color="yellow">Anchor Nam was eating pork
and onions like crazy earlier.</font>

487
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:33,464
<font color="yellow">Oh, pretty Hye Won. Good work.</font>

488
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,779
<font color="yellow">Ouch, that hurt.</font>

489
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:38,857
<font color="yellow">Everything that comes out of
your mouth is like art.</font>

490
00:35:38,857 --> 00:35:43,986
<font color="yellow">How could every word out of
your mouth be so pretty?</font>

491
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:46,616
<font color="yellow">Some people are scary with
every single word they speak.</font>

492
00:35:46,616 --> 00:35:48,506
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

493
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,366
<font color="yellow">Pretend you didn't hear that.</font>

494
00:35:54,515 --> 00:35:56,681
<font color="yellow">You insulted me behind my back, right?</font>

495
00:35:56,681 --> 00:35:59,937
<font color="yellow">I think I've done a lot
to warrant you insulting me.</font>

496
00:35:59,937 --> 00:36:01,263
<font color="yellow">Go for a drink with me.</font>

497
00:36:01,263 --> 00:36:02,625
<font color="yellow">Is that an order?</font>

498
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:07,102
<font color="yellow">I'm not really liking your
tone of voice very much...</font>

499
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:11,884
<font color="yellow">All the seniors and juniors
pander to you.</font>

500
00:36:12,611 --> 00:36:14,462
<font color="yellow">You think you're above everyone,
don't you?</font>

501
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:16,417
<font color="yellow">Just go for the darn drink.</font>

502
00:36:27,629 --> 00:36:30,185
<font color="yellow">Tell me what, exactly, you said about me.</font>

503
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:34,855
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

504
00:36:37,616 --> 00:36:40,053
<font color="yellow">I'm an announcer... an announcer.</font>

505
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,846
<font color="yellow">I only say correct things
and good things.</font>

506
00:36:45,861 --> 00:36:47,752
<font color="yellow">Don't you have any political aspirations?</font>

507
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:50,852
<font color="yellow">Not everyone can work in the
Blue House like your father.</font>

508
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:53,991
<font color="yellow">I should be the 9 p.m. anchor first.</font>

509
00:36:53,991 --> 00:36:57,102
<font color="yellow">You're already a strong candidate.</font>

510
00:36:57,692 --> 00:36:58,718
<font color="yellow">Says who?</font>

511
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:00,828
<font color="yellow">The person sitting across from you
is more certain.</font>

512
00:37:02,317 --> 00:37:03,739
<font color="yellow">Who? You?</font>

513
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:07,279
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you work a little harder
if you want to work with me?</font>

514
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:15,736
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, one more bottle of soju.</font>

515
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:16,756
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

516
00:37:18,294 --> 00:37:20,000
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Thank you.</font>

517
00:37:21,194 --> 00:37:22,917
<font color="yellow">How would we work at all?</font>

518
00:37:23,623 --> 00:37:25,239
<font color="yellow">When auditioning for anchor</font>

519
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:27,544
<font color="yellow">both anchors should have
basic pronunciations down.</font>

520
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:31,120
<font color="yellow">When they have us both in a two-shot,
do we give off a sense of security?</font>

521
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,759
<font color="yellow">Do our physical forms seem unbalanced?</font>

522
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:36,796
<font color="yellow">Our voices, tone, and even faces.</font>

523
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,402
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that the pair itself
will be judged too?</font>

524
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:42,087
<font color="yellow">Are you going to let Reporter Kye
become the main anchor?</font>

525
00:37:47,169 --> 00:37:50,326
<font color="yellow">I guess you could put in
some shoulder pads.</font>

526
00:37:50,326 --> 00:37:51,500
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

527
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,732
<font color="yellow">I'd rather die than work with
a man with bad breath again.</font>

528
00:38:00,803 --> 00:38:02,111
<font color="yellow">Look at that.</font>

529
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:04,716
<font color="yellow">You don't smell no matter what you eat.</font>

530
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:09,558
<font color="yellow">You ate garlic, mussels, and snails.</font>

531
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,520
<font color="yellow">Why don't you smell?</font>

532
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:17,774
<font color="yellow">Do you have feelings for me?</font>

533
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:20,187
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

534
00:38:22,562 --> 00:38:24,105
<font color="yellow">Try sitting next to me.</font>

535
00:38:25,114 --> 00:38:26,468
<font color="yellow">It won't be too bad.</font>

536
00:38:26,468 --> 00:38:27,870
<font color="yellow">You're arrogant.</font>

537
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,897
<font color="yellow">Who are you telling to sit next to you?</font>

538
00:38:29,897 --> 00:38:31,730
<font color="yellow">I know you want to.</font>

539
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:35,069
<font color="yellow">Why don't you be a little honest?</font>

540
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:37,230
<font color="yellow">Isn't it a win-win for both of us?</font>

541
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,160
<font color="yellow">I have to win first place in the
audition to get the 9 p.m. slot.</font>

542
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,584
<font color="yellow">But it would be a faster path
to get chosen by you?</font>

543
00:38:51,584 --> 00:38:53,404
<font color="yellow">I should do the news while
looking over my shoulder at you.</font>

544
00:38:53,404 --> 00:38:56,444
<font color="yellow">We could hold hands under the desk
while doing the news.</font>

545
00:38:56,444 --> 00:38:58,580
<font color="yellow">We could play footsie too.</font>

546
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,899
<font color="yellow">We could date, love... even marry.</font>

547
00:39:03,402 --> 00:39:06,089
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter to me
if you like someone.</font>

548
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:08,600
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it change right now?</font>

549
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,301
<font color="yellow">Inside your heart?</font>

550
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:12,500
<font color="yellow">A lot of women are interested
in my heart these days.</font>

551
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:18,741
<font color="yellow">I've never met someone as bold as you.</font>

552
00:39:18,741 --> 00:39:21,151
<font color="yellow">How many men have you dated in this way?</font>

553
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:22,960
<font color="yellow">About a hundred?</font>

554
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:26,694
<font color="yellow">I'm dating someone right now.</font>

555
00:39:26,694 --> 00:39:29,172
<font color="yellow">I'll dump him if you agree
to sit next to me.</font>

556
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:30,172
<font color="yellow">Hey...</font>

557
00:39:30,172 --> 00:39:34,076
<font color="yellow">Every man has left me
because he couldn't handle me.</font>

558
00:39:35,397 --> 00:39:37,189
<font color="yellow">I don't think you would, Senior.</font>

559
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:42,618
<font color="yellow">What's your reason for doing this to me?</font>

560
00:39:42,618 --> 00:39:44,430
<font color="yellow">You're good at your job.</font>

561
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:47,904
<font color="yellow">You treat me like I'm nothing.</font>

562
00:39:47,904 --> 00:39:50,779
<font color="yellow">Because of that... you're attractive.</font>

563
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:17,091
<font color="yellow">Is this because I drank?</font>

564
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:31,047
<font color="yellow">Are you sleeping?</font>

565
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:38,178
<font color="yellow">I think it's because I drank alcohol.
My chest is itchy.</font>

566
00:40:38,178 --> 00:40:39,243
<font color="yellow">It's weird.</font>

567
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,386
<font color="yellow">Do you have that ointment
that was prescribed before?</font>

568
00:40:50,026 --> 00:40:52,274
<font color="yellow">You always sleep facing the wall.</font>

569
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:56,852
<font color="yellow">Where should we meet tomorrow?</font>

570
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:58,796
<font color="yellow">There are people watching and all.</font>

571
00:40:58,796 --> 00:41:02,493
<font color="yellow">Let's meet two blocks away from
the station at the intersection, okay?</font>

572
00:41:04,944 --> 00:41:06,743
<font color="yellow">Are you sleeping? Look at me.</font>

573
00:41:09,395 --> 00:41:11,274
<font color="yellow">Oh, you're doing a face mask.</font>

574
00:41:18,493 --> 00:41:20,352
<font color="yellow">Are you sleeping with
your clothes off again?</font>

575
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,127
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's fall already.</font>

576
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,286
<font color="yellow">You'll catch a cold.</font>

577
00:41:32,779 --> 00:41:37,428
<font color="yellow">Yes, I got it from the meteorological
office, edited it, and sent it.</font>

578
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,480
<font color="yellow">Yes, please check. Thank you.</font>

579
00:41:41,611 --> 00:41:44,509
<font color="yellow">Why is it so cold already?
Is it going to be winter soon?</font>

580
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:48,955
<font color="yellow">Is he asleep?</font>

581
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,096
<font color="yellow">He'd better not be drinking.
He can't drink.</font>

582
00:41:54,732 --> 00:41:57,964
<font color="yellow">I thought she'd throw a fit
if I told her I drank.</font>

583
00:41:58,837 --> 00:42:00,252
<font color="yellow">How odd...</font>

584
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:13,683
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

585
00:42:13,683 --> 00:42:16,404
<font color="yellow">They're dating! Oh my gosh.</font>

586
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,580
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri, we're going to start.</font>

587
00:42:24,997 --> 00:42:26,359
<font color="yellow">Camera start.</font>

588
00:42:26,747 --> 00:42:29,098
<font color="yellow">Ready... cue!</font>

589
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:34,830
<font color="yellow">On your way to work this morning</font>

590
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,538
<font color="yellow">you will need to make sure
to carry an umbrella.</font>

591
00:42:37,538 --> 00:42:40,855
<font color="yellow"><i>We have cold autumn rain falling today.</i></font>

592
00:42:40,986 --> 00:42:42,303
<font color="yellow"><i>The rain...</i></font>

593
00:42:43,402 --> 00:42:48,002
<font color="yellow"><i>Considering that it is fall,
a lot of rain is expected.</i></font>

594
00:42:50,774 --> 00:42:53,788
<font color="yellow"><i>Everyone, please be careful
of catching a cold.</i></font>

595
00:42:59,478 --> 00:43:01,067
<font color="yellow">Attention.</font>

596
00:43:02,131 --> 00:43:03,875
<font color="yellow">Let's go out for a
company dinner tonight.</font>

597
00:43:05,555 --> 00:43:07,113
<font color="yellow">What? What's the matter?</font>

598
00:43:07,113 --> 00:43:11,158
<font color="yellow">I will be making some announcements
about the anchor auditions.</font>

599
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:13,091
<font color="yellow">Now do you want to come? Huh?</font>

600
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,594
<font color="yellow">Everyone has to come.
Announcers and weathercasters too.</font>

601
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,680
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

602
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,500
<font color="yellow">You're going to that pork belly place
we always go to, right?</font>

603
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,892
<font color="yellow">- Go to a different place.
- You want Thai food?</font>

604
00:43:23,388 --> 00:43:24,444
<font color="yellow">Then, you pay.</font>

605
00:43:31,629 --> 00:43:34,796
<font color="yellow">Gosh, he can't eat pork belly.</font>

606
00:43:44,904 --> 00:43:47,527
<font color="yellow">You asked to meet here last night?</font>

607
00:43:47,529 --> 00:43:48,915
<font color="yellow">Gosh...</font>

608
00:43:51,154 --> 00:43:53,430
<font color="yellow">You must have forgotten in your sleep.</font>

609
00:43:56,471 --> 00:44:00,884
<font color="yellow">Doctor Geum said you must never drink.</font>

610
00:44:00,884 --> 00:44:03,252
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do tonight?</font>

611
00:44:05,084 --> 00:44:08,335
<font color="yellow">You can't eat pork belly either,
but it's always that pork belly place.</font>

612
00:44:08,335 --> 00:44:10,685
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have slept undressed.
Here you go.</font>

613
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:12,243
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

614
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:15,618
<font color="yellow">- Undressed?
- It's not like you're at home.</font>

615
00:44:19,194 --> 00:44:20,614
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

616
00:44:21,163 --> 00:44:24,634
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, hey!
Stop just eating the meat.</font>

617
00:44:24,634 --> 00:44:26,861
<font color="yellow">Let's have a drink too!</font>

618
00:44:26,861 --> 00:44:28,540
<font color="yellow">Cheers, everyone.</font>

619
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,665
<font color="yellow">Cheers!</font>

620
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:37,931
<font color="yellow">Open your mouth wide.</font>

621
00:44:37,931 --> 00:44:39,886
<font color="yellow">Say "Ah."</font>

622
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,413
<font color="yellow">He's not supposed to eat pork belly,
drink, smoke, or anything.</font>

623
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:52,283
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, can you get me an order of
beef that's very lean with no fat.</font>

624
00:44:52,283 --> 00:44:53,705
<font color="yellow">Just one order, please.</font>

625
00:44:53,705 --> 00:44:55,024
<font color="yellow">- Sure.
- Thank you.</font>

626
00:44:55,757 --> 00:44:59,486
<font color="yellow">Cheers! Drink up, okay?</font>

627
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,718
<font color="yellow">Stop eating the
pork belly meat, would you?</font>

628
00:45:04,256 --> 00:45:05,951
<font color="yellow">Eat this beef, okay?</font>

629
00:45:05,951 --> 00:45:08,489
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. Go sit down.</font>

630
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:11,555
<font color="yellow">- What are you going to do?
- This is how these things are.</font>

631
00:45:13,763 --> 00:45:16,937
<font color="yellow">All right, everyone's settled in?</font>

632
00:45:16,937 --> 00:45:20,055
<font color="yellow">I want to say this one more time
before we get going.</font>

633
00:45:20,055 --> 00:45:25,600
<font color="yellow">This time around, the audition will be
aired live on an internal SBC network.</font>

634
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,098
<font color="yellow">So, I will take into account
what all of you think.</font>

635
00:45:29,098 --> 00:45:30,732
<font color="yellow">You have to do well.</font>

636
00:45:30,732 --> 00:45:31,823
<font color="yellow">One more thing.</font>

637
00:45:31,823 --> 00:45:33,605
<font color="yellow">The president was going to use
a ranking-based system.</font>

638
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,047
<font color="yellow">He was going to give
Lee Hwa Shin the top</font>

639
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:38,491
<font color="yellow">with Reporter Kye on the bottom.</font>

640
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:40,698
<font color="yellow">I fought him on that.</font>

641
00:45:40,698 --> 00:45:44,491
<font color="yellow">We put everyone on the same level.</font>

642
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,122
<font color="yellow">Wow!</font>

643
00:45:47,638 --> 00:45:49,690
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying this to show off.</font>

644
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:53,312
<font color="yellow">I'm just willing to do what it takes
for our news department.</font>

645
00:45:53,312 --> 00:45:56,062
<font color="yellow">Okay? All right? Do a good job.</font>

646
00:45:56,062 --> 00:45:58,236
<font color="yellow">Let's drink! Yeah!</font>

647
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:03,567
<font color="yellow">All right, next, Assistant Director Choi.</font>

648
00:46:03,567 --> 00:46:05,868
<font color="yellow">Okay! Salute!</font>

649
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:09,368
<font color="yellow">I am in line with the news department!</font>

650
00:46:13,511 --> 00:46:15,509
<font color="yellow">Salute, Director.</font>

651
00:46:16,254 --> 00:46:18,172
<font color="yellow">- Drink, drink.
- Salute!</font>

652
00:46:21,107 --> 00:46:23,868
<font color="yellow">Director, salute!</font>

653
00:46:23,868 --> 00:46:25,426
<font color="yellow">You're good at it.</font>

654
00:46:27,296 --> 00:46:30,649
<font color="yellow">Next, my lovable brother-in-law.</font>

655
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:34,803
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay. I'll do it.</font>

656
00:46:36,781 --> 00:46:38,272
<font color="yellow">Cheers. Thank you.</font>

657
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:43,502
<font color="yellow">Reporter Kye, I'll accept that love.
Please give it to me.</font>

658
00:46:43,502 --> 00:46:45,451
<font color="yellow">Why do you love me?</font>

659
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:47,873
<font color="yellow">- I don't want your love.
- No.</font>

660
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:50,743
<font color="yellow">I have to accept your love
no matter what. I will drink this.</font>

661
00:46:50,743 --> 00:46:53,031
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm fine. I'm fine.</font>

662
00:46:53,363 --> 00:46:56,384
<font color="yellow">Director, Reporter Kye, and Chief Bang.</font>

663
00:46:56,384 --> 00:46:58,263
<font color="yellow">Salute to all of you!</font>

664
00:46:58,263 --> 00:46:59,424
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

665
00:46:59,424 --> 00:47:01,605
<font color="yellow">Wow, what's with you?</font>

666
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:07,502
<font color="yellow">Why would you steal his drink though?</font>

667
00:47:07,502 --> 00:47:09,484
<font color="yellow">- Here. Have another one.
- Yes, Director.</font>

668
00:47:09,484 --> 00:47:11,732
<font color="yellow">Let's just finish having drinks.</font>

669
00:47:12,535 --> 00:47:14,198
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the drink.</font>

670
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,839
<font color="yellow">Director, I'll accept your love too.</font>

671
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:18,944
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- She was thirsty for love.</font>

672
00:47:24,029 --> 00:47:26,509
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. I'm fine.</font>

673
00:47:27,267 --> 00:47:28,649
<font color="yellow">You couldn't have one drink.</font>

674
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:31,890
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Lee, have one drink.
- Okay.</font>

675
00:47:33,009 --> 00:47:34,408
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

676
00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:37,165
<font color="yellow">Let's do a cheers.</font>

677
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:39,027
<font color="yellow">You came back?</font>

678
00:47:42,448 --> 00:47:44,415
<font color="yellow">She's crazy.</font>

679
00:47:44,415 --> 00:47:46,937
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin, I'll pour you a drink.</font>

680
00:47:46,937 --> 00:47:48,652
<font color="yellow">You can do it!</font>

681
00:47:51,236 --> 00:47:53,265
<font color="yellow">Drink with me, okay?</font>

682
00:47:54,884 --> 00:47:56,585
<font color="yellow">Are you his black rose?</font>

683
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:59,468
<font color="yellow">It must be nice for you.
You have a black rose.</font>

684
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,096
<font color="yellow">I'll have that! I really wanted it.</font>

685
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,714
<font color="yellow">Here you go, Hwa Shin.</font>

686
00:48:06,714 --> 00:48:07,873
<font color="yellow">Salute!</font>

687
00:48:11,129 --> 00:48:12,330
<font color="yellow">You're here again?</font>

688
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:13,591
<font color="yellow">I'll drink it.</font>

689
00:48:15,252 --> 00:48:16,500
<font color="yellow">You should eat something.</font>

690
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,850
<font color="yellow">- You're back?
- Yes.</font>

691
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:21,966
<font color="yellow">I'll do it. I will.</font>

692
00:48:32,473 --> 00:48:34,317
<font color="yellow">What is she doing?</font>

693
00:48:36,098 --> 00:48:39,377
<font color="yellow">- Order more. Order more.
- No more.</font>

694
00:48:39,377 --> 00:48:40,973
<font color="yellow">Director!</font>

695
00:49:16,848 --> 00:49:21,297
<font color="yellow"><i>I am a tree that does not break
even in the most treacherous storm.</i></font>

696
00:49:21,297 --> 00:49:27,370
<font color="yellow"><i>The reason I am living in the world is
because the 21st century wanted it.</i></font>

697
00:49:29,629 --> 00:49:31,727
<font color="yellow">In the heat of the south city!</font>

698
00:49:31,727 --> 00:49:35,750
<font color="yellow"><i>In the heat of the south city...</i></font>

699
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,687
<font color="yellow">An empty Manchurian plain!</font>

700
00:49:37,763 --> 00:49:42,859
<font color="yellow"><i>there is an empty Manchurian plain!</i></font>

701
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,892
<font color="yellow">Kye Sung Sook was really cool
back when we were in school.</font>

702
00:49:46,892 --> 00:49:48,165
<font color="yellow">If only she didn't sing.</font>

703
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:50,462
<font color="yellow">That's true. She's a terrible singer.</font>

704
00:49:51,212 --> 00:49:52,522
<font color="yellow">Who's next?</font>

705
00:49:52,843 --> 00:49:54,634
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin. Get up and sing.</font>

706
00:49:55,484 --> 00:49:58,815
<font color="yellow">If you don't sing,
you'll lose points for your audition.</font>

707
00:49:58,815 --> 00:50:01,475
<font color="yellow">You'll look better to people if you sing.</font>

708
00:50:01,475 --> 00:50:05,047
<font color="yellow">All of your seniors did it.</font>

709
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:07,047
<font color="yellow">- You're going to sing?
- I'll find a song.</font>

710
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:14,346
<font color="yellow"><i>I am always longing for you.</i></font>

711
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:19,348
<font color="yellow"><i>Where have you gone to?</i></font>

712
00:50:21,797 --> 00:50:23,980
<font color="yellow">Let's do another song.</font>

713
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,761
<font color="yellow">Director, don't let her do that one.</font>

714
00:50:26,761 --> 00:50:31,859
<font color="yellow"><i>My love, please come back to me.</i></font>

715

720
00:50:59,355 --> 00:51:00,736
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey.</font>

721
00:51:00,736 --> 00:51:02,578
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin, you have to do
"Wrongful Encounter."</font>

<font color="yellow">"Wrongful Encounter"!</font>

723

started to go wrong.</i></font>

729
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:34,814
<font color="yellow"><i>I started to get a bad feeling.</i></font>

730
00:51:34,814 --> 00:51:38,314
<font color="yellow"><i>You started to show
more interest in my friend.</i></font>

731
00:51:38,314 --> 00:51:41,013
<font color="yellow"><i>You started to distance yourself from me.</i></font>

732
00:51:41,013 --> 00:51:43,980
<font color="yellow"><i>That day, you and I...</i></font>

733
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,500
<font color="yellow"><i>It was after we had an argument.</i></font>

734
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:52,161
<font color="yellow"><i>Both you and my friend stopped calling.</i></font>

735
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:55,370
<font color="yellow"><i>It seemed like you were avoiding me.</i></font>

736
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,971

<font color="yellow"><i>You and my friend...</i></font>

739
00:52:04,473 --> 00:52:09,658

741
00:52:19,382 --> 00:52:21,794
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey. He left.</font>

742
00:52:23,156 --> 00:52:25,603
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri, are you okay?</font>

743
00:52:25,964 --> 00:52:28,111
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

744
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,450
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

745
00:52:35,837 --> 00:52:38,067
<font color="yellow">How much did she drink?</font>

746
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:55,995
<font color="yellow">I'm right in front of the station.</font>

747
00:52:55,995 --> 00:53:01,131
<font color="yellow"><i>If you're not busy right now,
can you come pick me up?</i></font>

748
00:53:01,131 --> 00:53:03,585
<font color="yellow">I went out with the news department.</font>

749
00:53:03,585 --> 00:53:06,388
<font color="yellow"><i>Everyone had a bit to drink.</i></font>

750
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:09,294
<font color="yellow">Who was that?</font>

751
00:53:09,294 --> 00:53:11,542
<font color="yellow">It sounded like Announcer Geum Soo Jung.</font>

752
00:53:11,542 --> 00:53:15,252
<font color="yellow">- Go and drive Announcer Geum home.
- Me... me?</font>

753
00:53:15,252 --> 00:53:17,712
<font color="yellow">Go now and take her home yourself.</font>

754
00:53:17,712 --> 00:53:20,544
<font color="yellow">If you keep this up,
I have my own ideas of what to do.</font>

755
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:21,754
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want.</font>

756
00:53:29,692 --> 00:53:31,669
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to live like you?</font>

757
00:53:31,669 --> 00:53:34,926
<font color="yellow">Dad treated you like you didn't exist,
as if he didn't know you.</font>

758
00:53:34,926 --> 00:53:37,868
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry someone I like.</font>

759
00:53:37,868 --> 00:53:39,047
<font color="yellow">Just let me have that.</font>

760
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:41,448
<font color="yellow">I can give you 99 other things.</font>

761
00:53:41,448 --> 00:53:43,178
<font color="yellow">Let me plan your marriage my way.</font>

762
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:48,419
<font color="yellow">Then I can let you have the
99 other things your way.</font>

763
00:53:54,928 --> 00:53:56,178
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

764
00:54:00,198 --> 00:54:01,718
<font color="yellow">Should I call Jung Won?</font>

765
00:54:02,259 --> 00:54:04,073
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

766
00:54:05,029 --> 00:54:06,210
<font color="yellow">Don't call him.</font>

767
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:10,140
<font color="yellow">Why? Jung Won can bring a car.</font>

768
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,600
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want him to see me like this.</font>

769
00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:16,520
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed.</font>

770
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,069
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll take you home.</font>

771
00:54:21,069 --> 00:54:25,069
<font color="yellow">No, I have a broadcast
in the morning so I can't.</font>

772
00:54:25,607 --> 00:54:27,640
<font color="yellow">- Go to the station.
- Okay.</font>

773
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:29,776
<font color="yellow">I'm so cold.</font>

774
00:54:29,776 --> 00:54:33,446
<font color="yellow">I'll go quickly.
Why didn't you dress warmer?</font>

775
00:54:33,448 --> 00:54:35,006
<font color="yellow">Now you have a cold.</font>

776
00:54:46,678 --> 00:54:50,821
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. You should go sleep.</font>

777
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:53,257
<font color="yellow">Maybe you shouldn't drink either.</font>

778
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:58,122
<font color="yellow">It's not like I have cancer
or I'm getting radiation.</font>

779
00:54:58,968 --> 00:55:01,036
<font color="yellow">Are you the boss of my drinking?</font>

780
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:04,553
<font color="yellow">Why would you drink
all that so recklessly?</font>

781
00:55:04,553 --> 00:55:06,683
<font color="yellow">How much did you drink?</font>

782
00:55:07,582 --> 00:55:11,868
<font color="yellow">I want to sleep. Just go so I can sleep.</font>

783
00:55:11,868 --> 00:55:13,703
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

784
00:55:13,703 --> 00:55:17,723
<font color="yellow">I'll be in the dorm rooms.</font>

785
00:55:17,723 --> 00:55:19,910
<font color="yellow">Call me if you're having a hard time.</font>

786
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:21,035
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

787
00:55:21,814 --> 00:55:25,477
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so nice suddenly?
It's really weird.</font>

788
00:55:26,718 --> 00:55:30,857
<font color="yellow">You're being really weird.
Did you eat something bad?</font>

789
00:55:38,796 --> 00:55:42,946
<font color="yellow">Will I be able to wake up
tomorrow morning?</font>

790
00:55:42,946 --> 00:55:45,832
<font color="yellow">Oh, but I'm so sleepy. What do I do?</font>

791
00:55:47,631 --> 00:55:48,747
<font color="yellow">You don't think you will?</font>

792
00:55:48,747 --> 00:55:52,484
<font color="yellow">I'm scared but I'm so sleepy.</font>

793
00:55:52,828 --> 00:55:55,515
<font color="yellow">I don't think I should sleep though.</font>

794
00:55:55,515 --> 00:55:58,877
<font color="yellow">My head hurts and my stomach hurts.</font>

795
00:55:58,877 --> 00:56:02,645
<font color="yellow">And why is it so cold outside?</font>

796
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:12,435
<font color="yellow">What do I do? I'm so tired.
But what if I can't wake up?</font>

797
00:56:12,877 --> 00:56:16,460

I'll be in big trouble.</font>

798
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,709
<font color="yellow">I'll really get fired this time.</font>

799
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:21,355
<font color="yellow">I can't even sleep.</font>

800
00:56:21,355 --> 00:56:23,689
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

801
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:27,388
<font color="yellow">Sleep. Just sleep.</font>

802
00:56:28,379 --> 00:56:30,978
