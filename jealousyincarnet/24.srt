10
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,060
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming out now? What were you doing?</font>

11
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,490
<font color="yellow">Why were you hiding?</font>

12
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,260
<font color="yellow">What did you do that you had to hide?</font>

13
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,860
<font color="yellow">Hey, let go. Let go.</font>

14
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,060
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

15
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,320
<font color="yellow">Hey. This is no way to treat an adult.</font>

16
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,260
<font color="yellow">Ever since my sister had a crush on you...</font>

17
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,120
<font color="yellow">while receiving no love for over three years,</font>

18
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,460
<font color="yellow">I hated you.</font>

19
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,190
<font color="yellow">You thought you were so great that you refused to accept her...</font>

20
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,720
<font color="yellow">and made her lonely and suffer.</font>

21
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,990
<font color="yellow">I was already angry with you.</font>

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,290
<font color="yellow">But if you're toying with my naive sister's feelings,</font>

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,160
<font color="yellow">I won't forgive you.</font>

24
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,520
<font color="yellow">If you hurt my sister, I'll kill you.</font>

25
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,390
<font color="yellow">If you think easy of her,</font>

26
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,320
<font color="yellow">I'll shut your mouth forever so you can never talk again.</font>

27

29
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,990
<font color="yellow">I'm 19. So what?</font>

30
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,420
<font color="yellow">If you're 19,</font>

31
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,860
<font color="yellow">that means you're under age.</font>

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,790
<font color="yellow">My goodness, you're just a kid.</font>

33
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,190
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk like that to a 36-year-old adult...</font>

34
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,590
<font color="yellow">and grab me by the collar.</font>

35
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,060
<font color="yellow">You're only half my age, you punk. How dare you.</font>

36
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,460
<font color="yellow">Is that how your sister raised you?</font>

37

42
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,390
<font color="yellow">will be the man who will never forget that, even for a moment.</font>

43

52
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,660
<font color="yellow">and nap with you under this blanket.</font>

53

<font color="yellow">we don't say anything because we don't know...</font>

<font color="yellow">How could none of you be on my side?</font>

85
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,290
<font color="yellow">And you'll go around claiming to be reporters with a conscience.</font>

<font color="yellow">Wait on stand-by until you get assigned to another program.</font>

93

<font color="yellow">you'll enjoy doing, too.</font>

95

96
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,460
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

97
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,020
<font color="yellow">did you hear that Hwa Shin has been transferred...</font>

98
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,190
<font color="yellow">to the company kindergarten management team?</font>

99
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,590
<font color="yellow">I guess he can't return to the newsroom.</font>

100
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,290
<font color="yellow">The company kindergarten?</font>

101
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,890
<font color="yellow">He won't be an anchor then?</font>

102
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,220
<font color="yellow">He can't even be a reporter, let alone an anchor.</font>

103
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,490
<font color="yellow">He can't even be a reporter, let alone an anchor.</font>

104
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,360
<font color="yellow">I guess he can't return to the newsroom.</font>

105
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,760
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

106
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,120
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

107
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,760
<font color="yellow">You cry so much.</font>

108
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,720
<font color="yellow">Is it about me?</font>

109
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,760
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

110
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,560
<font color="yellow">It obviously is.</font>

111
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,360
<font color="yellow">What will you do at the kindergarten?</font>

112
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,460
<font color="yellow">And how could they...</font>

113
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,960
<font color="yellow">have a reporter watch kids?</font>

114
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,960
<font color="yellow">Let's get lunch.</font>

115
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,620
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you angry?</font>

116
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,720
<font color="yellow">You're angry and crying on behalf of me.</font>

117
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,660
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

118
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,320
<font color="yellow">You really want to get married here?</font>

119
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,660
<font color="yellow">Do you prefer soup or a buffet? They asked us to taste it first.</font>

120
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,190
<font color="yellow">This is no time to plan a wedding.</font>

121
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,790
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Postpone it. Cancel it.</font>

122
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,490
<font color="yellow">Hey. Do you know how hard it is to get a reception hall?</font>

123
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,260
<font color="yellow">You must feel terrible right now.</font>

124
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,990
<font color="yellow">Why are you rushing?</font>

125
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,890
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to make me into an insensitive bride?</font>

126
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,890
<font color="yellow">My heart is breaking because you can't be an anchor.</font>

127
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,990
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid you won't marry me if I'm unemployed.</font>

128
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,720
<font color="yellow">Is someone chasing us?</font>

129
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,620
<font color="yellow">It's also rude to ask guests to come here on Christmas Eve.</font>

130
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,560
<font color="yellow">It's too soon.</font>

131
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,160
<font color="yellow">And you're in no state of mind...</font>

132
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,060
<font color="yellow">to get married. Let's cancel. Let's postpone. Let's go.</font>

133
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,220
<font color="yellow">No. We're not cancelling. Do you know how much that'll cost?</font>

134
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,420
<font color="yellow">How could you even set a date without asking your mother?</font>

135
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,420
<font color="yellow">This is insane.</font>

136
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,620
<font color="yellow">It's because it's my first time getting married.</font>

137
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,660
<font color="yellow">It's my first time too, but I at least know the proper order.</font>

138
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,190
<font color="yellow">Soup or buffet?</font>

139
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,090
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Sit down!</font>

140
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
<font color="yellow">I said sit!</font>

141
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,360
<font color="yellow">Who should officiate the wedding?</font>

142
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,160
<font color="yellow">Who should it be?</font>

143
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,260
<font color="yellow">- Mr Oh? - Mr Oh?</font>

144
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

145
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,120
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin used to be a reporter.</font>

146
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,990
<font color="yellow">But from now on, he can't be a reporter any more.</font>

147
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,460
<font color="yellow">He'll have to watch kids for the rest of his life at a kindergarten.</font>

148
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,120
<font color="yellow">But at times like these, the two of you should cherish each other more,</font>

149
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:07,030
<font color="yellow">love each other and live well together. That is my hope.</font>

150
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,460
<font color="yellow">Maybe not.</font>

151
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,260
<font color="yellow">They were destined for each other.</font>

152
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,790
<font color="yellow">They let out gas in front of each other long ago.</font>

153
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,760
<font color="yellow">They helped each other change their underwear.</font>

154
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,590

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,390
<font color="yellow">What job are you talking about?</font>

310
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,420
<font color="yellow">This is so embarrassing. Why did they put my name on it?</font>

311
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,120
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

312
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,590
<font color="yellow">Here, you can say whatever you want to say.</font>

313
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,590
<font color="yellow">No one will ever say anything to you.</font>

314
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,920
<font color="yellow">The advertisement is over.</font>

325
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,190
<font color="yellow">not being able to menstruate,</font>

<font color="yellow">This is Kim Sung Hwan's "Don't Ask".</font>

330
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
<font color="yellow">Music, cue.</font>

331
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,790
<font color="yellow">Hey. The social media page is going crazy.</font>

332
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,560
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of listeners.</font>

333
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,990
<font color="yellow">Get me some water.</font>

334
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,490
<font color="yellow">Water?</font>

335
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,560
<font color="yellow">There's no one to get it for you. Get it yourself.</font>

336
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,960
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee.</font>

337
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,520
<font color="yellow">What would I be good at?</font>

338
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,490
<font color="yellow">- You? - Yes.</font>

339
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

340
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,920
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't you be best at what you want to do?</font>

341
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,920
<font color="yellow">What I want to do?</font>

342
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,490
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it's only me,</font>

343
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,720
<font color="yellow">but your weather...</font>

344
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,960
<font color="yellow">always stood out and was the most enjoyable.</font>

345
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,760
<font color="yellow">That's very subjective.</font>

346
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,990
<font color="yellow">That's what I think.</font>

347
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,790
<font color="yellow">You're a good DJ, too.</font>

348
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,790
<font color="yellow">- Did you listen? - Yes.</font>

349
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
<font color="yellow">Don't listen. I'm going to quit soon.</font>

350
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,190
<font color="yellow">You're good at everything.</font>

351
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,960
<font color="yellow">- Everything? - Yes.</font>

352
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,660
<font color="yellow">Everything.</font>

353
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,260
<font color="yellow">Everything like what?</font>

354
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,720
<font color="yellow">Everything. Just everything.</font>

355
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,160
<font color="yellow">So tell me more specifically.</font>

356
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,960
<font color="yellow">Just everything.</font>

357
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,360
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

358
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,920
<font color="yellow">You're good at kissing, too.</font>

359
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,390
<font color="yellow">My brother-in-law is too clueless. You third wheel.</font>

360
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,220
<font color="yellow">Why... Why you freak.</font>

361
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,620
<font color="yellow">What are you doing to Jung Won's girlfriend?</font>

362
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,260
<font color="yellow">Are you insane?</font>

363
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,960
<font color="yellow">- Are you high? - It's not what you think.</font>

364
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,120
<font color="yellow">Are you a dog? Are you?</font>

365
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,660
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting like one?</font>

366
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,190
<font color="yellow">Jung Won is a great friend.</font>

367
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,790
<font color="yellow">Do you need to suffer in torment...</font>

368
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,660
<font color="yellow">after stealing his girlfriend in order to learn your lesson?</font>

369
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,690
<font color="yellow">How dare you steal your friend's girlfriend.</font>

370
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,460
<font color="yellow">Just live alone, you rat.</font>

371
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,520
<font color="yellow">It's better to live alone.</font>

372
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,690
<font color="yellow">How dare you go after your friend's girl.</font>

373
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,190
<font color="yellow">How am I supposed to face his mum? You punk.</font>

374
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,390
<font color="yellow">- You little... - Calm down.</font>

375
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,460
<font color="yellow">You too.</font>

376
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,690
<font color="yellow">You're tough, and you cook well.</font>

377
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,690
<font color="yellow">I liked you,</font>

378
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,990
<font color="yellow">but you play with 2 guys and tear apart 2 best friends?</font>

379
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,220
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

380
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,220
<font color="yellow">Even if he hit on you, you should've remained with your boyfriend.</font>

381
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,520
<font color="yellow">How humiliating is this?</font>

382
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,390
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry her.</font>

383
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,760
<font color="yellow">Shut it.</font>

384
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,990
<font color="yellow">Never!</font>

385
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,860
<font color="yellow">She broke up with Jung Won!</font>

386
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,220
<font color="yellow">I saw her eat with Jung Won and his mum not long ago.</font>

387
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,720
<font color="yellow">I saw it myself!</font>

388
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,290
<font color="yellow">She was seeing both of us!</font>

389
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,760
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

390
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,960
<font color="yellow">She likes me more. I won!</font>

391
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,720
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Ma'am.</font>

392
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,860
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

393
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,520
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't you let me explain?</font>

394
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,890
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

395
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,590
<font color="yellow">You thoughtless kid.</font>

396
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,060
<font color="yellow">What was so great about this girl that two guys would fight over her?</font>

397
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

398
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,060
<font color="yellow">What? Gosh.</font>

399
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,990
<font color="yellow">Then don't come.</font>

400
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,760
<font color="yellow">Don't come to the wedding.</font>

401
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,520
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.</font>

402
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
<font color="yellow">She's too good for me.</font>

403
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,020
<font color="yellow">You have no idea.</font>

404
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,920
<font color="yellow">Do you know how unappealing your son is?</font>

405
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,460
<font color="yellow">I'm someone who tries to quit my job every day.</font>

406
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,460
<font color="yellow">I might get unemployed. I also have breast cancer and...</font>

407
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,020
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, I'm really sorry.</font>

408
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,890
<font color="yellow">I'll think about marriage a little more.</font>

409
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,990
<font color="yellow">I'm not good enough to make her happy.</font>

410
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,790
<font color="yellow">Don't you like soup?</font>

411
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,990
<font color="yellow">If you don't, don't come to the wedding.</font>

412
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,520
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

413
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,460
<font color="yellow">I don't. I don't like it, you punk. I don't like it.</font>

414
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,090
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

415
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,360
<font color="yellow">- Good job, everyone. - Good job.</font>

416
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,020
<font color="yellow">- Good job. - Do you want to get dinner?</font>

417
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,360
<font color="yellow">Forget dinner. Let's grab a drink.</font>

418
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,960
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be right back.</font>

419
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,260
<font color="yellow">Do you have money saved up?</font>

420
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,660
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

421
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,920
<font color="yellow">I want to try to be this much interested in you.</font>

422
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,660
<font color="yellow">I have a car, a house and some land.</font>

423
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,220
<font color="yellow">I thought you were broke after your divorce.</font>

424
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,060
<font color="yellow">Fine. I live on rent, I'm still paying off my car,</font>

425
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,160
<font color="yellow">and the land isn't something I can sell,</font>

426
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,990
<font color="yellow">but I have a high salary.</font>

427
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,390
<font color="yellow">Your salary is the same as mine.</font>

428
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,320
<font color="yellow">You're not sick, right?</font>

429
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,920
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you want to live with me?</font>

430
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,390
<font color="yellow">I have high blood pressure, but I'm taking my medicine.</font>

431
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,890
<font color="yellow">I have reflux esophagitis,</font>

432
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,660
<font color="yellow">hepatocirrhosis,</font>

433
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,560
<font color="yellow">and there's a slight symptom of irritable bowel syndrome.</font>

434
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,990
<font color="yellow">You have nothing. Why do you have so many illnesses?</font>

435
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,290
<font color="yellow">Do you have any good traits?</font>

436
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,160
<font color="yellow">I'm honest, and I'll never cheat.</font>

437
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,620
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

438
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,690
<font color="yellow">It's not that you won't cheat. You just can't.</font>

439
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,790
<font color="yellow">Anything else you want to ask?</font>

440
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,920
<font color="yellow">Will you consider changing how you part your hair?</font>

441
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,990
<font color="yellow">There. Do you like that?</font>

442
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,920
<font color="yellow">The usual style is better.</font>

443
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,220
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

444
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,620
<font color="yellow">- Lose some weight. - Hey...</font>

445
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,290
<font color="yellow">- The wrinkles on your neck... - Hey...</font>

446
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,960
<font color="yellow">- Go see a dermatologist, too. - Hey...</font>

447
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,020
<font color="yellow">I like men with soft hands, but your hands are so rough.</font>

448
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,090
<font color="yellow">I won't say anything about the parts I can't see.</font>

449
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,690
<font color="yellow">Can you at least do something about the parts I can see?</font>

450
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,460
<font color="yellow">Do something about your clothes.</font>

451
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,920
<font color="yellow">Just say you don't like me.</font>

452
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,720
<font color="yellow">I thought after living in England for three years,</font>

453
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,860
<font color="yellow">you'd end up becoming a British gentleman.</font>

454
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,360
<font color="yellow">How did you get worse?</font>

455
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,420
<font color="yellow">How did you get so old?</font>

456
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,560
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

457
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,860
<font color="yellow">It's a good thing when someone is curious about another person.</font>

458
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,920
<font color="yellow">I find hope...</font>

459
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,790
<font color="yellow">in your complaints.</font>

460
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,990
<font color="yellow">Let's drink.</font>

461
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,660

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,560

476
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,790
<font color="yellow">What would I be good at?</font>

477
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:40,790

484

503

<font color="yellow">Today, we'll talk about weather breast-feeding is...</font>

504
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,420
<font color="yellow">really necessary or not.</font>

505
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,960
<font color="yellow">Professor Geum Suk Ho, who is a breast specialist,</font>

506
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,560
<font color="yellow">and Ms Oh Jin Joo, who is a nurse, are here with us.</font>

507
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,590
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

508
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,660
<font color="yellow">Many women have trouble deciding if they should breastfeed.</font>

509
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,520
<font color="yellow">What are your thoughts on this matter as an expert?</font>

510
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,020
<font color="yellow">When you breastfeed, the level of prolactin goes up.</font>

511
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,460
<font color="yellow">Prolactin helps prevent...</font>

512
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,120
<font color="yellow">breast cancer.</font>

513
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,620
<font color="yellow">It's one of the strongest anticancer elements.</font>

514
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,860
<font color="yellow">- It is? - Are you saying that...</font>

515
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,920
<font color="yellow">childbirth is related to breast cancer?</font>

516
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:53,560
<font color="yellow">Yes. Giving birth can help women prevent breast cancer.</font>

517
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,960
<font color="yellow">By giving birth,</font>

518
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,920
<font color="yellow">you shorten the time you're exposed to female hormones.</font>

519
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,360
<font color="yellow">Therefore, it lowers the risk of breast cancer.</font>

520
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,690
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

521
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,290
<font color="yellow">However, just because you didn't give birth or didn't breastfeed,</font>

522
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,420
<font color="yellow">it doesn't necessarily mean you'll get breast cancer.</font>

523
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,190
<font color="yellow">While breastfeeding is recommended,</font>

524
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:20,590
<font color="yellow">it's totally up to the mother to decide if she wants to do it or not.</font>

525
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

526
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,390
<font color="yellow">Also, choosing not to breastfeed...</font>

527
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,320
<font color="yellow">does not mean that the mother lacks love for her children.</font>

528
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,220
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

529
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,760
<font color="yellow">Let's listen to some music.</font>

530
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,620
<font color="yellow">Music, start.</font>

531
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,720
<font color="yellow">Will you be busy on Christmas Eve?</font>

532
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,360
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

533
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,790
<font color="yellow">What about you, Ms Oh?</font>

534
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,420
<font color="yellow">- No. - Don't you guys have a date?</font>

535
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,320
<font color="yellow">Both of you should relax.</font>

536
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,720
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

537
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,690
<font color="yellow">have you ever officiated a wedding before?</font>

538
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,790
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

539
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,520
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't.</font>

540
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,790
<font color="yellow">You've been waiting for me, right?</font>

541
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,790
<font color="yellow">- Are you coming straight from work? - Of course.</font>

542
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,990
<font color="yellow">I'm starving. Make me some food with the rice cooker you brought.</font>

543
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,260
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

544
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,660
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you could do something like this.</font>

545
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,520
<font color="yellow">By the way, Mr Lee,</font>

546
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,860
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit worried...</font>

547
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,190
<font color="yellow">because your mother doesn't like me.</font>

548
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,720
<font color="yellow">Don't care about her. She's always like that.</font>

549
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,060
<font color="yellow">She even disapproved of both my sisters-in-law at first.</font>

550
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,130
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Yes.</font>

551
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,960
<font color="yellow">Still, why don't we get married when she starts to like me?</font>

552
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,460
<font color="yellow">I think she'll get hurt if we push ahead like this.</font>

553
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,020
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to wait. - Let's do it next year.</font>

554
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:22,390
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong? - Don't you want to marry me?</font>

555
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,960
<font color="yellow">- Mr Lee. - Yes?</font>

556
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,160
<font color="yellow">Quit your job if you want.</font>

557
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,420
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to put up with a job you don't like just for me.</font>

558
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,360
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to stay quiet just for the monthly salary.</font>

559
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,630
<font color="yellow">I decided to start working as a weather reporter again.</font>

560
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,320

562
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,520
<font color="yellow">- Can I really do that? - Yes.</font>

563
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,790
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure? - Yes.</font>

564
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,020
<font color="yellow">Then I'm quitting tomorrow.</font>

565
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320

566
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,790
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

567
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,190
<font color="yellow">- Are you hungry? - Yes.</font>

568
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,390
<font color="yellow">I'll make you some food.</font>

569
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,490
<font color="yellow">Let's just eat at my place.</font>

00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,490

<font color="yellow">It may be a single handwritten letter.</font>

763

766

<font color="yellow">Na Ri, let's start the rehearsal.</font>

768
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,420
<font color="yellow">(10 years later)</font>

769
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,620
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, let's start. Cue.</font>

770
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,560
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Wait.</font>

771
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,520
<font color="yellow">Why are you sucking on that?</font>

772
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,920
<font color="yellow">Did you give him his milk?</font>

773
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,260
<font color="yellow">I told you to dress him warmly.</font>

774
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,160
<font color="yellow">Do you only see the baby?</font>

775
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,290
<font color="yellow">Are you jealous of the baby?</font>

776
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,260
<font color="yellow">Finally, today, on Christmas Eve of year 2056,</font>

777
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,120
<font color="yellow">we finally have the best weather in a month.</font>

778
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,790
<font color="yellow">Everyone walks around with an oxygen tank,</font>

779
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,660
<font color="yellow">but because I always did my exercise a hula hoop,</font>

780
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,160
<font color="yellow">I was fine with just a mask.</font>

781
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,160
<font color="yellow">Outings may become more difficult from now on,</font>

782
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,860
<font color="yellow">so I think I should have some instant noodles...</font>

783
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,060
<font color="yellow">by the Han River tonight with my husband.</font>

784
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:23,590
<font color="yellow">You should all exercise regularly...</font>

785
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,620
<font color="yellow">and be healthy.</font>

786
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,520
<font color="yellow">This is Pyo Na Ri.</font>

787
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,160
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

788
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,320
<font color="yellow">Good job today.</font>

789
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,120
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to come here?</font>

790
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,060
<font color="yellow">We didn't do a wedding shoot. Let's use this instead.</font>

791
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:03,790
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired.</font>

792
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,420
<font color="yellow">I'll never get married again because it's too tiring.</font>

793
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:08,220
<font color="yellow">Even if you're tired,</font>

794
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,020
<font color="yellow">you can do it again.</font>

795
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,120
<font color="yellow">Get married again if I die young.</font>

796
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:15,220
<font color="yellow">My cancer may relapse within five years.</font>

797
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,190
<font color="yellow">Then you can forget me and get married again to another guy...</font>

798
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,760
<font color="yellow">even if it's tiring.</font>

799
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,060
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

800
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,760
<font color="yellow">Did you bring me here to say that?</font>

801
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,320
<font color="yellow">You never know with life.</font>

802
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,760
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

803
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,860
<font color="yellow">Death, too.</font>

00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:34,860
<font color="yellow">Whatever the case,</font>

805
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,390
<font color="yellow">I will be stuck to you like an octopus until I die.</font>

806

<font color="yellow">Even if I act like an annoying octopus,</font>

807
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,760
<font color="yellow">don't use sesame oil to get me off of you...</font>

808
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,120
<font color="yellow">or use salt to make me faint, okay?</font>

809
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,290
<font color="yellow">I'll see about that.</font>

810
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,990
<font color="yellow">I like that attitude.</font>

811
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,860
<font color="yellow">May I ask you something?</font>

812
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,160
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

813
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,920
<font color="yellow">You grew to like me because you were jealous of Jung Won, right?</font>

814
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,890
<font color="yellow">If he didn't like me,</font>

815
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,590
<font color="yellow">you...</font>

816
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,420
<font color="yellow">probably would've never noticed me, just like before.</font>

817
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,790
<font color="yellow">- I don't know. - You don't know again?</font>

818
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:16,720
<font color="yellow">Even when I was in the same hospital room as you,</font>

819
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,160
<font color="yellow">I never even dreamed of marrying you.</font>

820
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,920
<font color="yellow">- Me neither. - Am I crazy?</font>

821
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,220
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have set you up with Jung Won if I had.</font>

822
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,790
<font color="yellow">- Right. - When I was in Thailand,</font>

823
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,590
<font color="yellow">I did think of you at times.</font>

824
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,060
<font color="yellow">Oh, my gosh.</font>

825
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,760
<font color="yellow">Why are you so shocked?</font>

826
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,490
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

827
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,760
<font color="yellow">You didn't think of anyone else, but you thought of me?</font>

<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

829
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:42,320
<font color="yellow">Were you lonely?</font>

830
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,320
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

831
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,960
<font color="yellow">Did you wish I'd come to Thailand?</font>

832
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,260
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

833
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,190
<font color="yellow">Why don't you know anything?</font>

834
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,190
<font color="yellow">Let's just leave it at that.</font>

835
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:54,620
<font color="yellow">You know everything. You're always showing off.</font>

836
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:57,220
<font color="yellow">It's because there's so much I don't know, that I'm here.</font>
