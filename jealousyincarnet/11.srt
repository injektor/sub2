1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,400
<font color="yellow">Don't be stupid and
tell Pyo Na Ri that you like her.</font>

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,030
<font color="yellow">Just shred your friendship to pieces.</font>

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,610
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I suppose so.</font>

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,360
<font color="yellow">Love comes first.</font>

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,300
<font color="yellow">Of course, you'll just
become a son of a bitch.</font>

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,020
<font color="yellow">You're making fun of me, aren't you?</font>

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,300
<font color="yellow">Of course I am.</font>

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,590
<font color="yellow">So, Senior... don't be a son of a bitch.</font>

9
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,910
<font color="yellow">Do the 9 p.m. news with me,
date me, and...</font>

10
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,580
<font color="yellow">You think I can't do it?</font>

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,510
<font color="yellow">I'll become a son of a bitch.</font>

12
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,300
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee.</font>

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,350
<font color="yellow">What are you doing there?</font>

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,330
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing there?</font>

15
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,710
<font color="yellow">I moved here to take care of Red.</font>

16
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,970
<font color="yellow">The two of you, together?</font>

17
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,130
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.
I can't live in a place like this.</font>

18
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,170
<font color="yellow">It's not that I'm worried.</font>

19
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,680
<font color="yellow">I'll get going now, Senior.</font>

20
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,900
<font color="yellow">I'll do that favor you asked of me.</font>

21
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,880
<font color="yellow">Then, are you going to live there now?</font>

22
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,390
<font color="yellow">Do you not like that?</font>

23
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,580
<font color="yellow">Do you?</font>

24
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,980
<font color="yellow">I don't need an answer.</font>

25
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,720
<font color="yellow">I have to see you every day.
It's a bit strange.</font>

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,750
<font color="yellow">A bit strange? It's very strange.</font>

27
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,050
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

28
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,890
<font color="yellow">This is unexpected.</font>

29
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,680
<font color="yellow">You heard everything so shouldn't you
ask your friend directly?</font>

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,260
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me about it?</font>

31
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,940
<font color="yellow">Because I don't think Hwa Shin will
even try to make excuses to me about it.</font>

32
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,170
<font color="yellow">Your friendship brings tears to my eyes.</font>

33
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,890
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's not
because you're afraid?</font>

34
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,710
<font color="yellow">Did I hear the whole story?</font>

35
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,220
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee Hwa Shin
can't become a son of a bitch.</font>

36
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,030
<font color="yellow">If he knew how...</font>

37
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,160
<font color="yellow">he wouldn't have been chased to Thailand
after all those exclusive stories he did.</font>

38
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,810
<font color="yellow">He would have joined hands
with me by now too.</font>

39
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,670
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't be pining for Pyo Na Ri</font>

40
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,280
<font color="yellow">who was in love with him for three years.</font>

41
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,870
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri doesn't like
Reporter Lee anymore.</font>

42
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,800
<font color="yellow">She likes you now.</font>

43
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,200
<font color="yellow"><i>[HWA SHIN]</i></font>

44
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,660
<font color="yellow">He's doing his best to forget his
feelings because you're his friend.</font>

45
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,380
<font color="yellow">How about you ignore this
and go about your business?</font>

46
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,280
<font color="yellow">Are you home, Sis?</font>

47
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,450
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

48
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,250
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you're home.</font>

49
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,900
<font color="yellow">- Why did you get thinner?
- Did I?</font>

50
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,130
<font color="yellow">Chi Yeol.</font>

51
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,850
<font color="yellow">Did the person who lived on
the rooftop before move away?</font>

52
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,430
<font color="yellow">That man who always walked around
in his underwear moved.</font>

53
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,540
<font color="yellow">It worked out well, right?</font>

54
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,040
<font color="yellow">Should we move too?</font>

55
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,150
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want to.</font>

56
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,990
<font color="yellow">That place is so close.
You can see and hear everything.</font>

57
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,280
<font color="yellow">It's kind of annoying and uncomfortable.</font>

58
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,990
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it interrupt your studies?</font>

59
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,920
<font color="yellow">I don't want to move.</font>

60
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,000
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

61
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,820
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

62
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,570
<font color="yellow">Did your date go well?</font>

63
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,830
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

64
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,600
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, friend. I like Pyo Na Ri.</font>

65
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,670
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

66
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,630
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to tell Pyo Na Ri I like her.
- You can't.</font>

67
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,770
<font color="yellow">I don't need your permission.
I'm going to tell her.</font>

68
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,190
<font color="yellow">- You can't.
- Jung Won, let's stop being friends.</font>

69
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,340
<font color="yellow">I feel so sorry to you and can't even
look at you, so I can't be your friend.</font>

70
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,690
<font color="yellow">That can't happen either.</font>

71
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,180
<font color="yellow">So, what can I do?</font>

72
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,870
<font color="yellow">Leave things the way they are now.</font>

73
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,990
<font color="yellow">The way things are now?</font>

74
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,310
<font color="yellow">Watching your backs like I am now?</font>

75
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,360
<font color="yellow">I think I'm going to go crazy with the
way things are now, so how can I?</font>

76
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,650
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take
Pyo Na Ri away from you.</font>

77
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,780
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri will come to me
if I tell her how I feel.</font>

78
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,700
<font color="yellow">I want to hold her hand, hold her,
kiss her, and sleep with her.</font>

79
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,140
<font color="yellow">Say that again.</font>

80
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,890
<font color="yellow">I want to hold her hand, hold her,
kiss her, and sleep with her.</font>

81
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,360
<font color="yellow">You son of a bitch!</font>

82
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,460
<font color="yellow">Is this you being a son of a bitch?</font>

83
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,390
<font color="yellow">How can you say we should
stop being friends over a girl?</font>

84
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,740
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I'm a son of a bitch!</font>

85
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,400
<font color="yellow">At the very least, I wanted to
tell you that I like Pyo Na Ri.</font>

86
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,060
<font color="yellow">Because even if I die,
I can't say these words to Pyo Na Ri.</font>

87
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,690
<font color="yellow">Because of you...</font>

88
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,710
<font color="yellow">I can't say them.</font>

89
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,450
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri won't know, even when she dies.</font>

90
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,410
<font color="yellow">She will never know.</font>

91
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,660
<font color="yellow">So, don't worry.</font>

92
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,940
<font color="yellow">What happened today...
I'm going to pretend that it didn't.</font>

93
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,790
<font color="yellow">I'll pretend I didn't hear it.</font>

94
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,220
<font color="yellow">I'll let it go this once.</font>

95
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,900
<font color="yellow">Chef, is there a problem with your eyes?</font>

96
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,760
<font color="yellow">I'm worried I'll do
something by accident.</font>

97
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,610
<font color="yellow">Come on in.</font>

98
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,680
<font color="yellow">Oh! You look cool, Uncle.</font>

99
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,280
<font color="yellow">Why are you being creepy
and wearing sunglasses indoors?</font>

100
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,290
<font color="yellow">Can you even see?</font>

101
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,810
<font color="yellow">I can do this with my eyes shut.</font>

102
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,950
<font color="yellow">Can you even tell
which one is salt or sugar?</font>

103
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,700
<font color="yellow">Since you brought the kids,
I'll treat them to something good.</font>

104
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,240
<font color="yellow">Tell me whatever you want to eat.</font>

105
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,900
<font color="yellow">Really? Kids, what do you want to eat?</font>

106
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,640
<font color="yellow">Red, what should we ask Chef to make?</font>

107
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,170
<font color="yellow">Chi Yeol has agreed to be
my son starting today, Chef.</font>

108
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,160
<font color="yellow">Let's ask him to make something
that's not on the menu.</font>

109
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,700
<font color="yellow">I'm okay with just anything.</font>

110
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,850
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, just anything?</font>

111
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,020
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, punk?</font>

112
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,120
<font color="yellow">Uncle, the school needs you to come in
to consult with the teachers.</font>

113
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,270
<font color="yellow">Red, I'll need to go for you too, right?
Mom will go for you.</font>

114
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,630
<font color="yellow">They want me to bring my mom.
Why would I bring you?</font>

115
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,730
<font color="yellow">They're all in the same class.
Why don't we go together?</font>

116
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,060
<font color="yellow">Should we do that?</font>

117
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,110
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

118
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,660
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Chef.</font>

119
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,970
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's nothing.</font>

120
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,200
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

121
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,950
<font color="yellow">That man is cute.</font>

122
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,710
<font color="yellow">Beom, look at the time.
Why are you here and not sleeping?</font>

123
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,620
<font color="yellow">Go to sleep. Go on.</font>

124
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,830
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

125
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,260
<font color="yellow">Eat up, go home, and sleep.</font>

126
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,050
<font color="yellow">Oh, Reporter. Reporter Lee.</font>

127
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,450
<font color="yellow">- Wait.
- Gosh.</font>

128
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,700
<font color="yellow">Why? Reporter.</font>

129
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,330
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

130
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,620
<font color="yellow">Do you want some ice cream?</font>

131
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,000
<font color="yellow"><i>[I LOVE YOU, PYO NA RI.]</i></font>

132
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,780
<font color="yellow">Gosh, can you just get lost?</font>

133
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,630
<font color="yellow">Hey! Who are you to tell me to get lost?</font>

134
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,770
<font color="yellow">You moved in right in front of my house
so why should I get lost?</font>

135
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,520
<font color="yellow">You should be the one
to get lost, Reporter!</font>

136
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,740
<font color="yellow">- Can you get lost, Reporter Lee?
- What?</font>

137
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,030
<font color="yellow">If you haven't moved in yet,
can't you find another place near Red?</font>

138
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,080
<font color="yellow">It doesn't have to be that place.</font>

139
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,330
<font color="yellow">It's very uncomfortable.</font>

140
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,240
<font color="yellow">I can see and hear
everything you are doing.</font>

141
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,840
<font color="yellow">I only used ice cream to bring that up.
Is that anything to get upset about?</font>

142
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,240
<font color="yellow">- What right do you have?
- What?</font>

143
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,150
<font color="yellow">What right do you have to tell me
where I should or shouldn't live?</font>

144
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,640
<font color="yellow">Am I looking for a place for
us to live in together?</font>

145
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,250
<font color="yellow">I'm living there alone,
so who are you to say anything?</font>

146
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,660
<font color="yellow">Unless you're going to live with me</font>

147
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,570
<font color="yellow">don't say anything
about liking it or not.</font>

148
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,800
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

149
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,650
<font color="yellow">Also, stop hanging around in front of me.</font>

150
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,860
<font color="yellow">Don't show your face
in front of me again!</font>

151
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,040
<font color="yellow">Just disappear from my sight.</font>

152
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,460
<font color="yellow">Go emigrate to the moon or the stars.
Go up to the clouds.</font>

153
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,300
<font color="yellow">Just vanish, please!</font>

154
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,660
<font color="yellow">Are you finished?</font>

155
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,980
<font color="yellow">Don't even speak to me.</font>

156
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,680
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

157
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,750
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh! What did I do?</font>

158
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,550
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry, Reporter. I didn't know.</font>

159
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,790
<font color="yellow">What should I do? What do I do?</font>

160
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,270
<font color="yellow">I didn't think it would actually hit you.</font>

161
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,090
<font color="yellow">Oh no! I'm so sorry.</font>

162
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,000
<font color="yellow">It's chocolate flavored too.
Your clothes are all ruined too.</font>

163
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,920
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</font>

164
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,050
<font color="yellow">I'll wash it for you.
Take it off. Take it off.</font>

165
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,290
<font color="yellow">Reporter, you've been going
to the hospital, right?</font>

166
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,480
<font color="yellow">Is my chest yours?
Do you have a lease on it?</font>

167
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,650
<font color="yellow">You think you own it?</font>

168
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,120
<font color="yellow">This won't do. Go home and take it off.
Throw it to me from your roof.</font>

169
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,160
<font color="yellow">I'll catch it from my roof, wash it,
iron it, and return it to you.</font>

170
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,720
<font color="yellow">I always told you not to eat dairy.</font>

171
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,460
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you really good ice cream.
Please, forgive me.</font>

172
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,790
<font color="yellow">I won't eat it.</font>

173
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,370
<font color="yellow">You can't eat it often,
but once in a while is okay.</font>

174
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,000
<font color="yellow">Strawberry? Vanilla?
Do you not like vanilla?</font>

175
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,840
<font color="yellow">Should I buy you chocolate too?</font>

176
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,420
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry, Reporter Lee.</font>

177
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,050
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Reporter.</font>

178
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,150
<font color="yellow">This isn't right.</font>

179
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,350
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

180
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,380
<font color="yellow">How could she be so cute?</font>

181
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,330
<font color="yellow">I'm crazy.</font>

182
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,540
<font color="yellow"><i>[THREE YEARS AGO]</i></font>

183
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,750
<font color="yellow">What would you like?</font>

184
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,270
<font color="yellow">I'll have the chicken.</font>

185
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,770
<font color="yellow">It's best to eat it warm.</font>

186
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,140
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

187
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,110
<font color="yellow">Reporter, do you mind if I sit here?</font>

188
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,240
<font color="yellow">Which one are you eating?
Mine is chicken.</font>

189
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,090
<font color="yellow">Steak sandwich.</font>

190
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,250
<font color="yellow">I want to try the steak too.</font>

191
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:24,370
<font color="yellow">Should we eat half of each other's?
We can try both kinds.</font>

192
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,890
<font color="yellow">You can eat it all.</font>

193
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,430
<font color="yellow">They're both delicious.</font>

194
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,790
<font color="yellow">He should eat with me.</font>

195
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,860
<font color="yellow">Not coffee. I'll take a mango smoothie.</font>

196
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,980
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

197
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,840
<font color="yellow">- Oh, you startled me.
- Reporter Lee.</font>

198
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,060
<font color="yellow">I wasn't following you, Reporter.</font>

199
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,180
<font color="yellow">Assistant Director Choi asked me to
buy some drinks before coming back in.</font>

200
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,330
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

201
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,680
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Bye.</font>

202
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,230
<font color="yellow">Yum, so good. Is yours good too?</font>

203
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,130
<font color="yellow">Did you know many people
come here for blind dates?</font>

204
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,510
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever have them?</font>

205
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,590
<font color="yellow">No, I don't. How about you?</font>

206
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,190
<font color="yellow">I have one in five minutes.</font>

207
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,810
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you had to
buy drinks for people?</font>

208
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,350
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

209
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,890
<font color="yellow">She's so bothersome, so bothersome.</font>

210
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,700
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

211
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,690
<font color="yellow">Yes, hello.</font>

212
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,560
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

213
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,220
<font color="yellow"><i>[HAN JI MIN]</i></font>

214
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,190
<font color="yellow">- Ji Min.
- Yes.</font>

215
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,740
<font color="yellow">You're an Eastern medicine doctor.</font>

216
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,630
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes.</font>

217
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,300
<font color="yellow">I had appointments until the evening.</font>

218
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,650
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I could only make time now.</font>

219
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,270
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's no problem.</font>

220
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,850
<font color="yellow">What is it?
Are you feeling uncomfortable?</font>

221
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,660
<font color="yellow">A weird girl wanted to share
her sandwich with me earlier.</font>

222
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,290
<font color="yellow">I think I was just taken aback
and now I have indigestion.</font>

223
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,560
<font color="yellow">I'll take a look for you
if you take off your jacket.</font>

224
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,510
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

225
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,440
<font color="yellow">One moment.</font>

226
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,940
<font color="yellow">Your pulse seems normal.</font>

227
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,170
<font color="yellow">Please turn around this way.</font>

228
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,180
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

229
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,020
<font color="yellow">Right here.</font>

230
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,540
<font color="yellow">Do you know that person?</font>

231
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,990
<font color="yellow">I don't know her.</font>

232
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,650
<font color="yellow">Does that feel better?</font>

233
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,780
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

234
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,760
<font color="yellow">How is that? Does that feel better?</font>

235
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,310
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

236
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,740
<font color="yellow">You must feel much better now.</font>

237
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,800
<font color="yellow">I'll do that for you
whenever you get indigestion.</font>

238
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,980
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

239
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,380
<font color="yellow">I guess I won't need any
digestive medication.</font>

240
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,300
<font color="yellow">I'm free next Friday or Saturday.</font>

241
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,330
<font color="yellow">How about both Friday and Saturday?</font>

242
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,640
<font color="yellow">Truthfully, I'm free on Sunday too.</font>

243
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,540
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

244
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,440
<font color="yellow">Should we order?</font>

245
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,070
<font color="yellow">Don't pay any attention to her.</font>

246
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,410
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

247
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,810
<font color="yellow">What would you like to have?</font>

248
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,970
<font color="yellow">I'll have...</font>

249
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,880
<font color="yellow">chocolate tea.</font>

250
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,550
<font color="yellow">Hey, I heard that Pyo Na Ri
has a crush on you.</font>

251
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,710
<font color="yellow">The entire news department
is talking about it.</font>

252
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,470
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just accept her feelings?
I feel sorry for her.</font>

253
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,570
<font color="yellow">Do you get into a relationship
out of pity?</font>

254
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,450
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri must have issues.
Why would she like a guy like him?</font>

255
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,650
<font color="yellow">I'm so annoyed by it too.</font>

256
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,310
<font color="yellow">Hey, just go on a few dates with her</font>

257
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,420
<font color="yellow">when you're really bored
with nothing to do.</font>

258
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,770
<font color="yellow">You know, if you get sick of pretty
girls or girls from good households.</font>

259
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,750
<font color="yellow">Dong Gi.</font>

260
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,920
<font color="yellow">Hello, Director.</font>

261
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,810
<font color="yellow">You have issues.</font>

262
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,730
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee,
you looked good on screen today.</font>

263
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,260
<font color="yellow">Your shirt looked good too.</font>

264
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,780
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten yet?</font>

265
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
<font color="yellow">We had octopus.</font>

266
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,770
<font color="yellow">Do you like me?</font>

267
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,800
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

268
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,740
<font color="yellow">Do you like me, Pyo Na Ri?</font>

269
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,750
<font color="yellow">- Well, that's...
- You don't, right?</font>

270
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,620
<font color="yellow">If you don't have a boyfriend,
pick one from here.</font>

271
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,970
<font color="yellow">What the heck?</font>

272
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,510
<font color="yellow">Why would you tell her
to pick from one of us?</font>

273
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,670
<font color="yellow">Choose one.</font>

274
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,710
<font color="yellow">Pick anyone except me.</font>

275
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,420
<font color="yellow">Who is that? What was that?</font>

276
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,510
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going home?</font>

277
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,540
<font color="yellow">Your mother asked me for
Pyo Na Ri's number.</font>

278
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,230
<font color="yellow">What do you think that means?</font>

279
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,310
<font color="yellow">"I don't think you need
to know her number."</font>

280
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,660
<font color="yellow">"When a young man
and woman are in love"</font>

281
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,350
<font color="yellow">"the love grows more passionate
the more people try to pull them apart."</font>

282
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,890
<font color="yellow">"It seems they already
have issues anyway."</font>

283
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,770
<font color="yellow">"It is best to take a
few steps back and observe."</font>

284
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:57,570
<font color="yellow">"There is high chance that they will
break up on their own, ma'am."</font>

285
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,470
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, President?</font>

286
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,280
<font color="yellow">Drive Pyo Na Ri to the station
tomorrow morning.</font>

287
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,470
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

288
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,720
<font color="yellow">Sis, are you busy tomorrow morning?</font>

289
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,500
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the beach
and report live.</font>

290
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,050
<font color="yellow">I can't come home. Why?</font>

291
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,770
<font color="yellow">- It's nothing.
- What is it?</font>

292
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,550
<font color="yellow">Nothing. You'll be late. Go.</font>

293
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,500
<font color="yellow">Go back in and get some more sleep.</font>

294
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,080
<font color="yellow">Sleep!</font>

295
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,010
<font color="yellow">I wonder why he didn't come today.</font>

296
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,770
<font color="yellow">Are you already assuming that
he has to come early every morning?</font>

297
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,790
<font color="yellow">He's much busier than I am.</font>

298
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,570
<font color="yellow">I should be telling him not to come
even when he insists on coming.</font>

299
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,080
<font color="yellow">If you really are
his girlfriend, that is.</font>

300
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,110
<font color="yellow">I should buy a car
even if I have to take out a loan.</font>

301
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,660
<font color="yellow">Who is it at this hour? Who is it?</font>

302
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,010
<font color="yellow">- Oh my!
- Red!</font>

303
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,020
<font color="yellow">Where do you think you're going?
Get out, get out!</font>

304
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,180
<font color="yellow">Red! What are you doing?</font>

305
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,360
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

306
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,470
<font color="yellow">I'll take you to school starting today.</font>

307
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,050
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to school.</font>

308
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,460
<font color="yellow">- That girl.
- Get out!</font>

309
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,580
<font color="yellow">Get out here now!</font>

310
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,630
<font color="yellow">People let you get away with everything.
What do you mean you're not going?</font>

311
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,160
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
- Hey, we have to feed her first.</font>

312
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,390
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

313
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,120
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

314
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,970
<font color="yellow">Red, I'll make sure you go to college.</font>

315
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,920
<font color="yellow">She's last place in her school.</font>

316
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,460
<font color="yellow">I'll help you get married too.</font>

317
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,330
<font color="yellow">You don't need to get married.</font>

318
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,180
<font color="yellow">Who needs to get married
in this day and age?</font>

319
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,380
<font color="yellow">So, don't worry about a thing.</font>

320
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,370
<font color="yellow">Think of me as a dad
and tell me if you need anything.</font>

321
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,910
<font color="yellow">You can lean on me if things are hard.</font>

322
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,170
<font color="yellow">I can give you an
allowance if you need it.</font>

323
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,430
<font color="yellow">How much do you need?</font>

324
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,310
<font color="yellow">Okay. Give me 10 million won.</font>

325
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,690
<font color="yellow">10 million won?</font>

326
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:41,720
<font color="yellow">What do you need that for?</font>

327
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,930
<font color="yellow">I'll hear you out and
give it to you if you need it.</font>

328
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,050
<font color="yellow">You really don't know?</font>

329
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,780
<font color="yellow">Dad had a debt of one billion won
after he was ruined, thanks to you.</font>

330
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,190
<font color="yellow">You don't know what he went through
trying to pay that off.</font>

331
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,720
<font color="yellow">Pay me 10 million won per month for
a year and that will be one billion won.</font>

332
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,970
<font color="yellow">You really must be last place in school.</font>

333
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,250
<font color="yellow">You should calculate properly.</font>

334
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,560
<font color="yellow">If you get 10 million won a month,
that's 120 million won in a year.</font>

335
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,200
<font color="yellow">So it would take eight years and four
months to get to 10 billion won.</font>

336
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,630
<font color="yellow">You're so annoying.</font>

337
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,320
<font color="yellow">I hear that multiple times a day.</font>

338
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,640
<font color="yellow">That's mine.</font>

339
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,880
<font color="yellow">This is my mom's cooking.
Did she come by?</font>

340
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,190
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

341
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,630
<font color="yellow">Just as I thought,
Mom's dumplings are the best.</font>

342
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,560
<font color="yellow">Are you not wearing a bra these days?</font>

343
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,150
<font color="yellow">I told you that I'd be wielding my knife
if anyone besides Red ate the dumplings.</font>

344
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,180
<font color="yellow">Reporter Kye started
eating them yesterday.</font>

345
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,870
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee ate them too.</font>

346
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,570
<font color="yellow">How can the two of you
live in the same house?</font>

347
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,800
<font color="yellow">I just can't understand it.</font>

348
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,980
<font color="yellow">- Me neither.
- What are you doing here at this hour?</font>

349
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,370
<font color="yellow">- I moved.
- What?</font>

350
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,420
<font color="yellow">The executives are all here.</font>

351
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,950
<font color="yellow">As for the expected changes in sales
for the first half of next year</font>

352
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:24,260
<font color="yellow">as you can see, the operation profit
will be used for the property taxes.</font>

353
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,030
<font color="yellow">We should not feel safe though.</font>

354
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,650
<font color="yellow">We should increase our efforts
in the Indian market.</font>

355
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,890
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him, Secretary Cha?</font>

356
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,780
<font color="yellow">Hey, I told you not to
hit me in the back.</font>

357
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,660
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't look away.</font>

358
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,950
<font color="yellow">Are you going to keep
hitting me in the back?</font>

359
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,020
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I can't control myself.</font>

360
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,470
<font color="yellow">Stop glaring at me and look at that.</font>

361
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,740
<font color="yellow">It'll put you in a good mood.</font>

362
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,930
<font color="yellow">The Yellow Sea beach has been designated
a UNESCO World Heritage site.</font>

363
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,020
<font color="yellow">Go down and get a good story.</font>

364
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,640
<font color="yellow">What's up with you?
Why would you give me a good story?</font>

365
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,540
<font color="yellow">Because you're just my favorite, okay?</font>

366
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,220
<font color="yellow">I want you to go there and suffer.</font>

367
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:18,060
<font color="yellow">The Morning News team is there and
they're doing the weather there tomorrow.</font>

368
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,140
<font color="yellow">You can meet them there.</font>

369
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,160
<font color="yellow">- I'll go alone.
- Why?</font>

370
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,510
<font color="yellow">They'll get in my way.</font>

371
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,370
<font color="yellow">Why would you send a reporter?</font>

372
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,280
<font color="yellow">I had already contacted the mayor
for an interview.</font>

373
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,140
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Kye!
- Really?</font>

374
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,000
<font color="yellow">You're an anchor though.
You should be at your desk.</font>

375
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,150
<font color="yellow">How long could it take?
It's just a short distance away.</font>

376
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,470
<font color="yellow">I already know what the interview will be</font>

377
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,610
<font color="yellow">so it'll be quick like bam, bam, bam.</font>

378
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,280
<font color="yellow">I'll get a wide shot of the beach
from the helicopter.</font>

379
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,500
<font color="yellow">- It won't even take half the day.
- Really?</font>

380
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,630
<font color="yellow">If an anchor went out
herself for an interview</font>

381
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,150
<font color="yellow">it would feel more realistic.</font>

382
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,150
<font color="yellow">Since it's an event to celebrate,
it means more for the anchor to go.</font>

383
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:56,350
<font color="yellow">It makes it special.
Director, it'll look good to the bosses.</font>

384
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,580
<font color="yellow">I think it sounds good.</font>

385
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:04,330
<font color="yellow">Hey, is this cutting in line,
hitting, or outright thievery?</font>

386
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,380
<font color="yellow">I'm standing right here with my eyes open</font>

387
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,320
<font color="yellow">so how can you steal my item?</font>

388
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,750
<font color="yellow">What law says I can't?</font>

389
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,120
<font color="yellow">Is there a rule that says an anchor
must have her butt glued to the chair?</font>

390
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,130
<font color="yellow">Do you think doing this means you'll
get the 9 p.m. main anchor job?</font>

391
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,470
<font color="yellow">Don't come after me like this.</font>

392
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:23,180
<font color="yellow">Let's be fair about
our competition, okay?</font>

393
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,270
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm so scared.</font>

394
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,990
<font color="yellow">I'm okay with it.</font>

395
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,040
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee.</font>

396
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,250
<font color="yellow">Reporter.</font>

397
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,710
<font color="yellow">Do you like live squid?</font>

398
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,900
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the beach.</font>

399
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,790
<font color="yellow">Should I go get some live squid
and make some squid stew?</font>

400
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:15,090
<font color="yellow">I'm really good at making it.
Just forgive me for yesterday.</font>

401
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,040
<font color="yellow">You live across the street and it's
so awkward to leave things like this.</font>

402
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,220
<font color="yellow">If you don't like squid stew,
we could just eat seasoned squid.</font>

403
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,330
<font color="yellow">But you have to cut the thing
on the cutting board so cruelly.</font>

404
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,630
<font color="yellow">Can you help me with that?</font>

405
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:31,500
<font color="yellow">Then let's have fresh squid and soju
on the rooftop once I come back.</font>

406
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,030
<font color="yellow">Let's do that with Go Jung Won.</font>

407
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,760
<font color="yellow">Do you want to call Jung Won?</font>

408
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,780
<font color="yellow">Answer me.</font>

409
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,030
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry!</font>

410
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,500
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Lee Hwa Shin gets angry so easily.</font>

411
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:07,790
<font color="yellow">The more I think about it,
I can't hold it in because I get angrier.</font>

412
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:11,920
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, I wasn't able to say anything
because you took me by surprise.</font>

413
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,210
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to let you take
Pyo Na Ri away from me.</font>

414
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,730
<font color="yellow">Don't even look Pyo Na Ri
in the eye or talk to her.</font>

415
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,940
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

416
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,860
<font color="yellow">You're a lowlife who set me up with her</font>

417
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,850
<font color="yellow">because you didn't
even know you liked her.</font>

418
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,920
<font color="yellow">You're a crazy idiot who used Red as an
excuse to move in next to Pyo Na Ri.</font>

419
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,010
<font color="yellow">You're a pervert who looks
at his friend's girl</font>

420
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,820
<font color="yellow">and gets excited and turned on.</font>

421
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,080
<font color="yellow">You're a total jerk who even hit me
in the back when we were boxing.</font>

422
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,440
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- You...</font>

423
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:43,940
<font color="yellow">You shut your mouth.
Just shut your mouth.</font>

424
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,620
<font color="yellow">With the upcoming departure,
there were expectations and excitement.</font>

425
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,440
<font color="yellow">The families were waiting to meet...</font>

426
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,910
<font color="yellow">Pull yourself together, Senior.</font>

427
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,650
<font color="yellow">You'll lose your friend
and your love at this rate.</font>

428
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,360
<font color="yellow">Jung Won and I wouldn't waver
so easily over a girl.</font>

429
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,860
<font color="yellow">We wouldn't waver so easily.</font>

430
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,080
<font color="yellow">You think so?</font>

431
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,720
<font color="yellow">Why did you let Pyo Na Ri stay in a
one-sided love with you for three years?</font>

432
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,680
<font color="yellow">- Leave.
- Why?</font>

433
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,810
<font color="yellow">I've never seen President Go like this.</font>

434
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,180
<font color="yellow">Let me see something fun, Senior.</font>

435
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,420
<font color="yellow">You should've made it
so she got over you quickly.</font>

436
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,980
<font color="yellow">How hard do you think it was for her?</font>

437
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,540
<font color="yellow">You called yourself a man and
let her do that for three years?</font>

438
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,460
<font color="yellow">Even if it was a one-sided love,
you received it for free for three years!</font>

439
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,690
<font color="yellow">You arrogant piece of crap.</font>

440
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,950
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- Stop what?</font>

441
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,330
<font color="yellow">I haven't even gone three minutes.</font>

442
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,520
<font color="yellow">Think about the girl
who suffered for three years.</font>

443
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,550
<font color="yellow">You can't handle three minutes!</font>

444
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:15,780
<font color="yellow">I know I caused my own problems,
so stop it already!</font>

445
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,370
<font color="yellow">If I had accepted Pyo Na Ri's feelings,
this wouldn't be happening today.</font>

446
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,800
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't be in the middle of this
and we wouldn't be fighting.</font>

447
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,040
<font color="yellow">Is that what you want?</font>

448
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,740
<font color="yellow">Are you getting mad at me
because that's not what I did?</font>

449
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,810
<font color="yellow">So, should I go change
Pyo Na Ri's mind now?</font>

450
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,370
<font color="yellow">You crazy punk.</font>

451
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,560
<font color="yellow">You'd better not let Pyo Na Ri
find out about your feelings.</font>

452
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,660
<font color="yellow">Don't ever let her find out.
You're too late.</font>

453
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,690
<font color="yellow">You couldn't do it three years ago.
You don't have a chance anymore.</font>

454
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,260
<font color="yellow">The moment you set her up with me...</font>

455
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,960
<font color="yellow">- Are you not confident?
- You really...</font>

456
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,370
<font color="yellow">- Are you not...
- want to give this a go?</font>

457
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,820
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri is coming.</font>

458
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,540
<font color="yellow">Why are you here, President?</font>

459
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,180
<font color="yellow">Don't ever get caught.</font>

460
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,260
<font color="yellow">You're dead if you get caught.
I'm trusting you.</font>

461
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,390
<font color="yellow">Don't trust me.</font>

462
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,540
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

463
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,080
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

464
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,930
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

465
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,440
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

466
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,990
<font color="yellow">Don't trust me!</font>

467
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,440
<font color="yellow">Don't trust me! Don't trust me!</font>

468
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,460
<font color="yellow">Don't trust me! Why are you trusting me?</font>

469
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,690
<font color="yellow">Why are you trusting me? Just don't.</font>

470
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,540
<font color="yellow">Don't trust me so I can do what I want.</font>

471
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,270
<font color="yellow">What a waste to see this by myself.</font>

472
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:51,970
<font color="yellow">I can't do anything
because you keep trusting me.</font>

473
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,930
<font color="yellow">Please don't trust me.</font>

474
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,120
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee.</font>

475
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,080
<font color="yellow">You can do it!</font>

476
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,000
<font color="yellow">Did something happen between you two?</font>

477
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,220
<font color="yellow">Did you fight?</font>

478
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,350
<font color="yellow">Do you guys fight too?</font>

479
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,650
<font color="yellow">We don't fight.</font>

480
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,000
<font color="yellow">We've never fought before.</font>

481
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,620
<font color="yellow">You should've called before coming.</font>

482
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,100
<font color="yellow">Didn't you come to see me?</font>

483
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,920
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving the city with
Reporter Kye tomorrow morning.</font>

484
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,780
<font color="yellow">I'm staying over one night.</font>

485
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,640
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel like seeing the sea?</font>

486
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,310
<font color="yellow">It would be nicer to see it together.</font>

487
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,640
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri was in a one-sided love
with you for three years.</font>

488
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,740
<font color="yellow">You can win her over
if you just tell her.</font>

489
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,480
<font color="yellow">Do you like me or Hwa Shin more?</font>

490
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

491
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,620
<font color="yellow">Do you like me or Hwa Shin more?</font>

492
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,660
<font color="yellow">- That's...
- Don't answer that.</font>

493
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,730
<font color="yellow">My question is childish.</font>

494
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,370
<font color="yellow">Why is it funny? Who do you like more?</font>

495
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:34,080
<font color="yellow">- That's...
- No, don't answer that.</font>

496
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,310
<font color="yellow">My question is so immature.</font>

497
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,080
<font color="yellow">He's not being won over even
when I seduce him with the beach.</font>

498
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:05,670
<font color="yellow">I told you to find out that weather
forecaster's number, so why no news?</font>

499
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,880
<font color="yellow">I don't think you need to
know her number.</font>

500
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,610
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

501
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,970
<font color="yellow">When it comes to love
between a man and a woman</font>

502
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:18,220
<font color="yellow">you know it becomes more passionate
when you try to pull them apart.</font>

503
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,080
<font color="yellow">It seems they already have issues anyway.</font>

504
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,830
<font color="yellow">You saw that he was acting strange
during the meeting earlier.</font>

505
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:33,340
<font color="yellow">He even sent me here to Pyo Na Ri's home
by myself this morning.</font>

506
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,450
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes.</font>

507
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,540
<font color="yellow">If you take a few steps back and observe</font>

508
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,570
<font color="yellow">there is a good chance
they will break up.</font>

509
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,690
<font color="yellow">All right, you can go.</font>

510
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,950
<font color="yellow">I did what you asked
regarding your mother.</font>

511
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,440
<font color="yellow">- Did you take the medicine?
- I'm glad you're here.</font>

512
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,860
<font color="yellow">Do the dishes, okay?</font>

513
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,320
<font color="yellow">Oh my, oh my!</font>

514
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,350
<font color="yellow">You... you...</font>

515
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,800
<font color="yellow">You took them, right? You did.</font>

516
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,020
<font color="yellow">- Are you experiencing side effects?
- The things I do because of you.</font>

517
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,670
<font color="yellow">Do the dishes, okay?</font>

518
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,390
<font color="yellow">You have to do these things.
It's the only way to have kids.</font>

519
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,350
<font color="yellow">It's the only way to get married.</font>

520
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:48,160
<font color="yellow">Yeah, have fun with Reporter Kye.</font>

521
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,750
<font color="yellow">Have some good sashimi with Reporter Kye.</font>

522
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,030
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, have some soju too.</font>

523
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,390
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm going to.</font>

524
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,160
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

525
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,270
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the hospital. Okay, let's go.</font>

526
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,020
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee, look at me.</font>

527
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:24,080
<font color="yellow">How could you not even
look at me all day?</font>

528
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,740
<font color="yellow">Was it so wrong to throw the ice cream?</font>

529
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,460
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

530
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,100
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you.</font>

531
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,540
<font color="yellow">Do you not want to see me that much?</font>

532
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,010
<font color="yellow">I'll get in trouble if I'm with you.</font>

533
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,480
<font color="yellow">- With whom?
- My mom.</font>

534
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:43,090
<font color="yellow">Since when have you listened to your mom?</font>

535
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,420
<font color="yellow">Since when have you listened to anyone?</font>

536
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,510
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

537
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,870
<font color="yellow">They want you to come now.
The doctor called me.</font>

538
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,620
<font color="yellow">They said you haven't been in for
radiation since you went with me.</font>

539
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,580
<font color="yellow">Are you really trying to die?</font>

540
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,750
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll give you one of these.</font>

541
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,680
<font color="yellow">Eat this and let's go, okay?</font>

542
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,100
<font color="yellow">I'll open this for you.
Let's eat and get going.</font>

543
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,020
<font color="yellow">Let's go. We have to go.</font>

544
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,560
<font color="yellow">Wow! This is so good.</font>

545
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,770
<font color="yellow">Let's go. We have to go.</font>

546
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,880
<font color="yellow">Am I a child? A child?</font>

547
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,920
<font color="yellow">Of course, you are.
A child who's afraid of the hospital.</font>

548
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,350
<font color="yellow">A child who hates the hospital
more than anything.</font>

549
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,280
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

550
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,120
<font color="yellow">Should I open you a new one?</font>

551
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,360
<font color="yellow">When you start dating a guy...</font>

552
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,400
<font color="yellow">do you always change like this?</font>

553
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:55,250
<font color="yellow">Do you melt like ice cream
to the men you're dating too?</font>

554
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,020
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

555
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,580
<font color="yellow">I've only ever been
looked down on by you.</font>

556
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,130
<font color="yellow">How dirty. Get out.</font>

557
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,810
<font color="yellow">I said get out.</font>

558
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,630
<font color="yellow">Which one of your moms is coming?</font>

559
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,600
<font color="yellow">I don't have a mom.</font>

560
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,840
<font color="yellow">Are they both going to come?</font>

561
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,670
<font color="yellow">If they both show up,
I'll die of embarrassment.</font>

562
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,420
<font color="yellow">Hey, you have to be back here by 10:00!</font>

563
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,290
<font color="yellow">Na Ri will be here, right?</font>

564
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,690
<font color="yellow"><i>She's not coming?</i></font>

565
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:12,460
<font color="yellow">How could she not on a day like today?
She should come even if she's busy.</font>

566
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,320
<font color="yellow">Did you not tell her about it?</font>

567
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,770
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it.</font>

568
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,660
<font color="yellow">Hey, even so...</font>

569
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:23,740
<font color="yellow">She won't care about saving money and
she'll try to send me to medical school.</font>

570
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,130
<font color="yellow">I want to stop making her suffer
once I get to college.</font>

571
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:30,890
<font color="yellow">If Na Ri finds out that you chose a major
without letting her know about it</font>

572
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,460
<font color="yellow">you will be buried alive at Rak Villa.</font>

573
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,900
<font color="yellow">She will get a shovel and come at you.</font>

574
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,280
<font color="yellow">Call her now.</font>

575
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,020
<font color="yellow">Don't get buried by her.</font>

576
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,020
<font color="yellow">Why do you think she goes around
early in the morning doing the weather?</font>

577
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,820
<font color="yellow">You said she's doing the announcer
exam again to help you study.</font>

578
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,280
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

579
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,290
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you punk. You're too much.</font>

580
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,560
<font color="yellow"><i>[CHEF KIM RAK]</i></font>

581
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,890
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
- I was wondering if Red told you.</font>

582
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:15,460
<font color="yellow">Did she tell you about the meeting
with her teacher today at 10:00?</font>

583
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,390
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm not saying you have to come.</i></font>

584
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:21,120
<font color="yellow">Announcer Bang is going,
so you should sacrifice this time.</font>

585
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,870
<font color="yellow">What time is it now?</font>

586
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,190
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop the car.</font>

587
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,330
<font color="yellow">Stop the car now.</font>

588
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,780
<font color="yellow">Okay? Stop the car.</font>

589
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,920
<font color="yellow">Hey, go buy some rice crackers there.</font>

590
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,840

- Go.</font>

591
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,020
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

592
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,130
<font color="yellow">Go, go. Hurry.</font>

593
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,510
<font color="yellow">Go to Gureum High School, okay?</font>

594
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:57,800
<font color="yellow">Oh my! Hey, Reporter!</font>

595
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,440
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

596
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,560
<font color="yellow"><i>[PYO NA RI]</i></font>

597
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,940
<font color="yellow">Is this yours?</font>

598
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,070
<font color="yellow">Do you want to sell this to me?</font>

599
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,500
<font color="yellow">Sell it to me for 1,000 won.</font>

600
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,670
<font color="yellow">I'll give you 2,000 won.</font>

601
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,940
<font color="yellow">3,000 won.</font>

602
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,360
<font color="yellow">You'll stand out among the mothers.</font>

603
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,410
<font color="yellow">It's my first time going
as a student's mom.</font>

604
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,660
<font color="yellow">Don't be nervous.</font>

605
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,880
<font color="yellow">I hope Red is happy to see me.</font>

606
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,410
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is a school zone.</font>

607
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,010
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Oh gosh.</font>

608
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,390
<font color="yellow">It must be a woman.</font>

609
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,150
<font color="yellow">Reporter Kye?</font>

610
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:50,270
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

611
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,210
<font color="yellow">She's going to get there before me.</font>

612
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,440
<font color="yellow">I told her not to do this.</font>

613
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,720
<font color="yellow">Reporter Kye, stop right there. Stop!</font>

614
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,020
<font color="yellow">Where is Red? Both moms are here.</font>

615
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,000
<font color="yellow">Did your mom say she'd come?</font>

616
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,280
<font color="yellow">Teacher, hello.</font>

617
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,420
<font color="yellow">- Teacher, hello.
- Hello.</font>

618
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,940
<font color="yellow">You must all be busy.
Thank you for coming.</font>

619
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,130
<font color="yellow">- Please sit down.
- Thank you.</font>

620
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,650
<font color="yellow">- Dae Gu?
- That's me.</font>

621
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,920
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

622
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,230
<font color="yellow">And Red?</font>

623
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,260
<font color="yellow">Red's mom?</font>

624
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,560
<font color="yellow">That's me. I am her mom, Teacher.</font>

625
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,160
<font color="yellow">I am Red's mom.</font>

626
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,240
<font color="yellow">Ah, I see.</font>

627
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,330
<font color="yellow">Red's mom, you must have
worried about being late.</font>

628
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:14,330
<font color="yellow">You must have run here.
Please, use this.</font>

629
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,330
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

630
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,090
<font color="yellow">You look very familiar.</font>

631
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:22,030
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry, Teacher.</font>

632
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:24,140
<font color="yellow">I know I must look terrible.</font>

633
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,990
<font color="yellow">I've left my daughter in your care and
I'm a sinner for only showing up now.</font>

634
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:32,000
<font color="yellow">No need to say such a thing.</font>

635
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,250
<font color="yellow">Teacher.</font>

636
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:38,700
<font color="yellow">If you can send Red to college,
I am willing to do anything.</font>

637
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,620
<font color="yellow">I know she's not good at studying,
but studying is not everything, right?</font>

638
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,920
<font color="yellow">Let's find something that's not studying,
but something she's talented at.</font>

639
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,750
<font color="yellow">We can still send her to
a good college, right?</font>

640
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:51,360
<font color="yellow">It's a problem that there can
only be one number one.</font>

641
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,240
<font color="yellow">We should look at other criteria,
not just studies.</font>

642
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,100
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't society be happier
if everyone could be number one?</font>

643
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:01,560
<font color="yellow">Don't you think there is something
my Red is very good at?</font>

644
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,950
<font color="yellow">All children have at least one thing...</font>

645
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:09,870
<font color="yellow">No, they most definitely have one thing
they love and are passionate about.</font>

646
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:15,200
<font color="yellow">I believe that every child has something
they can be first place in.</font>

647
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,800
<font color="yellow">I will do anything you need.</font>

648
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,760
<font color="yellow">I just want my daughter to find
something that excites her</font>

649
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,880
<font color="yellow">so she can be first place.</font>

650
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,610
<font color="yellow">Please help her find a college
that suits her.</font>

651
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:29,960
<font color="yellow">If you inform and teach me,
I will do anything to help her.</font>

652
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,640
<font color="yellow">- Okay, Teacher?
- Yes!</font>

653
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,310
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

654
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,660
<font color="yellow">Me, Teacher?</font>

655
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,590
<font color="yellow">I... am Chi Yeol's stepmom.</font>

656
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:53,760
<font color="yellow">Chi Yeol's mom.
You should've come earlier.</font>

657
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,400
<font color="yellow">Chi Yeol is so talented.</font>

658
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,020
<font color="yellow">No, he'll be the top student.</font>

659
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,570
<font color="yellow">But that kid says it's too expensive and
he doesn't want to trouble his sister.</font>

660
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:06,410
<font color="yellow">He refuses to go to medical school,
no matter what.</font>

661
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,810
<font color="yellow">I'm going insane.</font>

662
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:09,860
<font color="yellow">- Teacher, I'll choose my major...
- Medical school?</font>

663
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:13,340
<font color="yellow">Medical school? Of course I'll send him.</font>

664
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,990
<font color="yellow">- He has the grades for it.
- Ma'am...</font>

665
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:16,240
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

666
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,750
<font color="yellow">He will become a dependable doctor
because Chi Yeol is so mature.</font>

667
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,460
<font color="yellow">Leave it to me.</font>

668
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:27,600
<font color="yellow">Then should we get started on
each person, one by one?</font>

669
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:33,210
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Red.</font>

670
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,820
<font color="yellow">You're embarrassed because
I showed up looking this way, right?</font>

671
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,420
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's the beach!</font>

672
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,890
<font color="yellow">You guys!</font>

673
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,150
<font color="yellow">- Finished, right?
- Yes.</font>

674
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,690
<font color="yellow"><i>This caller is unavailable
to take your call.</i></font>

675
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,360
<font color="yellow"><i>Didn't you come to see me?</i></font>

676
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,310
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving the city with
Reporter Kye tomorrow morning.</font>

677
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:06,380
<font color="yellow">I'm staying over one night.</font>

678
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,600
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel like seeing the sea?</font>

679
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,000
<font color="yellow">It would be nicer to see it together.</font>

680
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:17,230
<font color="yellow">She said she was going with Reporter Kye.</font>

681
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:24,000
<font color="yellow">Call the weathercasters' office
and find out where Pyo Na Ri is.</font>

682
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,580
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
- <i>Hey!</i></font>

683
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,350
<font color="yellow">Kye Sung Sook can't make it to
that story she stole from you.</font>

684
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,460
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do?</font>

685
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,630
<font color="yellow">Chi Yeol is a senior.</font>

686
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:56,530
<font color="yellow">I can't even feed him good food.</font>

687
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:00,110
<font color="yellow">I'm going catch this live squid
and feed it to him.</font>

688
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:03,000
<font color="yellow">Oh, here it is.</font>

689
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,610
<font color="yellow">It's here.</font>

690
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:22,100
<font color="yellow">Hey, squid!</font>

691
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,820
<font color="yellow">I'll go borrow some clothes for you.</font>

692
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,240
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I want to see her now.</font>

693
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:42,360
<font color="yellow">There's one here.</font>

694
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:50,150
<font color="yellow">Gosh, she went to catch live squid for
her little brother and she's still at it.</font>

695
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,390
<font color="yellow">Is that Pyo Na Ri?</font>

696
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,810
<font color="yellow">Isn't the tide coming in at 10:30?</font>

697
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,030
<font color="yellow">Is she planning to die
just to catch a squid?</font>

698
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:00,630
<font color="yellow">Tell her to come back in.</font>

699
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:03,460
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri, hurry back in!</font>

700
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,460
<font color="yellow">My throat hurts.
I don't think she can hear.</font>

701
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,990
<font color="yellow">Take this and go to the car.</font>

702
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:29,820
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri!</font>

703
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,430
<font color="yellow">Get over here.</font>

704
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,840
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

705
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,310
<font color="yellow">I'm not in a place I can't be in.</font>

706
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,200
<font color="yellow">You came here on purpose.</font>

707
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,510
<font color="yellow">You can't give up on her?</font>

708
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,510
<font color="yellow">Were you going to try something
when I wasn't around?</font>

709
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,410
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously?</font>

710
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:37,420
<font color="yellow">Don't you work, by the way?</font>

711
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,830
<font color="yellow">Do you have nothing better to do
than follow a girl around?</font>

712
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:44,870
<font color="yellow">Or did you go on about trusting me,
when you actually don't?</font>

713
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,800
<font color="yellow">Did you come here to watch over us?</font>

714
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,190
<font color="yellow">You only started liking her
because I liked her, right?</font>

715
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,910
<font color="yellow">You want to take her from me
because she's my girl.</font>

716
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:55,040
<font color="yellow">I ought to just...</font>

717
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,290
<font color="yellow">You've always wanted everything
that was mine.</font>

718
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,940
<font color="yellow">You've always been jealous of me,
haven't you?</font>

719
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,770
<font color="yellow">Get over here, you.</font>

720
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:36,090
<font color="yellow">Live your entire life
being jealous of me.</font>

721
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:39,240
<font color="yellow">If you do 10 things for her,
I'll do 100 things for her.</font>

722
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,080
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do things for her that you
can't do even if you try all your life.</font>

723
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:51,060
<font color="yellow">This one is nice and big!</font>

724
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:55,010
<font color="yellow">I've never known jealousy.</font>

725
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:58,370
<font color="yellow">You can spend your life being jealous.
That's the best you can do.</font>

726
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:59,790
<font color="yellow">What, you punk!</font>

727
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:24,240
<font color="yellow">Are you a billionaire or a gangster?
Why are you so good at fighting?</font>

728
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,860
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's easy
for me to hate you?</font>

729
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,340
<font color="yellow">Are we still friends?</font>

730
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,580
<font color="yellow">We are, you punk.</font>

731
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,060
<font color="yellow">Are we still friends?</font>

732
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,970
<font color="yellow">Of course we are, you punk!</font>

733
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,680
<font color="yellow">You're worried because of me, aren't you?</font>

734
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,280
<font color="yellow">It's because you're jealous!</font>

735
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,350
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

736
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,800
<font color="yellow">I am jealous of you.</font>

737
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,350
<font color="yellow">And you're worried and anxious
because of me.</font>
