from your pasta restaurant.</font>

You don't know her number?</font>

6

7

How could you do such a thing?</font>

we were to find her.</font>

9

<font color="yellow">Are you even a human being?</font>

10
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:43,568
<font color="yellow">Were you playing around with me,
feeding me your disgusting pasta?</font>

11
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:44,916
<font color="yellow">Playing around?</font>

12
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,187

<font color="yellow">I'm not interested in women.</font>

15
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:53,877

21
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:07,916

disgusting give me nightmares.</font>

00:01:33,122 --> 00:01:35,720

to kill your brother.</font>

What have you been doing?</font>

59
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:33,008
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

60
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:39,253
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

61

<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

62
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,585
<font color="yellow">Did you wash your face?</font>

63
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:49,820
<font color="yellow">So, this is how you usually
go around looking.</font>

64
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,489
<font color="yellow">This is the style you like, huh?</font>

65
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:52,936
<font color="yellow">That's not necessarily true.</font>

66
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:58,003
<font color="yellow">I thought the way you looked at the
hospital was you at your least pretty.</font>

67
00:04:58,003 --> 00:04:59,469
<font color="yellow">I guess not.</font>

68
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:03,828
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to tell me to get in?</font>

69
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:07,251
<font color="yellow">I was worried that you
might not get in, so thanks.</font>

70
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:08,701
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

71
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:14,100
<font color="yellow">You go on air at 6 a.m.

<font color="yellow">I have to get the files from the
meteorologist, prepare, get the CG.</font>

73
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:19,253
<font color="yellow">Then do makeup.</font>

74
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,044
<font color="yellow">I have to go by 3:00.</font>

75
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:23,123
<font color="yellow">How long had you been
waiting in front of my house?</font>

76
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,602
<font color="yellow">Why ask something like that?</font>

77
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:26,898
<font color="yellow">Did you come from work?
Aren't you busy?</font>

78
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:28,732
<font color="yellow">I'm going to work after I drop you off.</font>

79
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:29,741
<font color="yellow">This early?</font>

80
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:32,647
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the airport early,
so I can go after I drop you off.</font>

81
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:37,746

How do you get to the station by 3:00?</font>

82
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:39,828
<font color="yellow">Are you going to drive me every day?</font>

83
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:42,522
<font color="yellow">Or will you just buy me a car instead?</font>

84
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:44,878
<font color="yellow">- You like that kind of thing?
- Would you do it if I did?</font>

85
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,869
<font color="yellow">I'll have to think twice
if that's what you want.</font>

86
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:48,249
<font color="yellow">I totally want it.</font>

87
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:51,679
<font color="yellow">How big of a car?</font>

88
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:54,109
<font color="yellow">- A really big one.
- Ah, a big one?</font>

89
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:55,828
<font color="yellow">Since we're at it, a super big one.</font>

90
00:05:55,828 --> 00:05:57,734
<font color="yellow">All right, that's enough.</font>

91
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,778
<font color="yellow">Thinking about going
to work at this hour</font>

92
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,818
<font color="yellow">and carrying all this stuff
is seriously...</font>

93
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:07,285
<font color="yellow">it's so suffocating,
so I was just saying it.</font>

94
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:10,833
<font color="yellow">I am very materialistic though
and I like free things.</font>

95
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:12,424
<font color="yellow">You should think twice about it.</font>

96
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:14,313
<font color="yellow">If I think twice,
I lose out on good clothes.</font>

97
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:15,674
<font color="yellow">Women are the same.</font>

98
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:18,734
<font color="yellow">Does Reporter Lee know
you're acting this way to me?</font>

99
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:21,698
<font color="yellow">It hasn't been long since the funeral.
I'll talk to him later.</font>

100
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:22,766
<font color="yellow">What will you say?</font>

101
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:24,852
<font color="yellow">That I want to have a passionate
relationship with Pyo Na Ri.</font>

102
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:25,876
<font color="yellow">Oh my god.</font>

103
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:29,412
<font color="yellow">Even if I don't buy you a car
or drive you every day</font>

104
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:31,374
<font color="yellow">will you still date me?</font>

105
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:38,854
<font color="yellow">I wonder why there are no stars tonight.
It's very strange.</font>

106
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:41,431
<font color="yellow">There should be some,
but there are none.</font>

107
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,323
<font color="yellow">It's weird. There are no stars.</font>

108
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,794

<font color="yellow">Oh! I think I'm going to fly away.</font>

111
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,155
<font color="yellow">Who told you to cause all
that trouble and involve me?</font>

112
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:11,376
<font color="yellow">Now we have shoot early in the morning.</font>

113
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:13,037
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

114
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:14,957
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri, stand by!</font>

115
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:17,777
<font color="yellow">Oh no! What do I do?</font>

116
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:22,208
<font color="yellow">Hey, do something about that
crazy skirt thing flying around!</font>

117
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,597
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay!</font>

118
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:27,720
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri, you look like
a mom at a wedding.</font>

119
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,712
<font color="yellow">You could light the candles
for the wedding.</font>

120
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:32,707
<font color="yellow">Seven seconds to lighting the candles.</font>

121
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,219
<font color="yellow">Five, four...</font>

122
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:41,357
<font color="yellow">- Hey!

123
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:42,975
<font color="yellow">Two, one. Cue!</font>

124
00:07:43,436 --> 00:07:47,628
<font color="yellow">Are you all enjoying your Thanksgiving
holiday with your families?</font>

125

129
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:04,422
<font color="yellow">Oh! Good job, Pyo Na Ri.</font>

130
00:08:04,422 --> 00:08:06,855
<font color="yellow">The skirt is doing its job
of showing the weather.</font>

131
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:12,806
<font color="yellow">The tail end of the typhoon will remain
with winds of up to 30 meters per second.</font>

132
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,090
<font color="yellow"><i>First, you will have to
prepare your signs</i></font>

133

<font color="yellow"><i>greenhouses, and other facilities.</i></font>

134
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:18,818
<font color="yellow">It's a hit.</font>

135
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:20,857
<font color="yellow"><i>You will need to prepare.</i></font>

136
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:24,672
<font color="yellow">Good! CG for the whole country!</font>

137
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:27,186
<font color="yellow">In now!</font>

138
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:32,075

141
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,200
<font color="yellow">You probably shouldn't be drinking that.</font>

142
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,415

- We got one more car.</font>

143
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,758
<font color="yellow">Drink this one instead.</font>

144
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:51,916
<font color="yellow">It has no milk or cream.</font>

145
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,936
<font color="yellow">I'll go to the committee meeting
and bring the news source.</font>

146
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:56,941
<font color="yellow">You guys start setting up
at the scene.</font>

147
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:57,941
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

148
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:01,239
<font color="yellow">Reporter?</font>

149
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,940
<font color="yellow">Oh my. What was that?</font>

150
00:09:07,206 --> 00:09:09,566
<font color="yellow">Is going to pretend he
doesn't even know me now?</font>

151
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:19,170
<font color="yellow"><i>Red, it's Mom.</i></font>

152
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,409
<font color="yellow"><i>I know you're inside.</i></font>

153
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:29,489
<font color="yellow"><i>Open the door, Red.</i></font>

154
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:35,949
<font color="yellow">Mom made you your favorite foods.</font>

155
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:38,194
<font color="yellow">I'll leave them by the door,
so make sure to eat them.</font>

156
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:40,457
<font color="yellow">Eat them with rice, Red.</font>

157
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:42,316
<font color="yellow">Make sure to just study.</font>

158
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:45,731
<font color="yellow">You're very pretty,
so be careful of boys.</font>

159
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:47,291
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

160
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,451
<font color="yellow">This lady has been coming every day.</font>

161
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:12,792
<font color="yellow">Red, it's Mom.</font>

162
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:17,230
<font color="yellow">I bought some clothes for you to wear.</font>

163
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,051
<font color="yellow">Can you come out and try them on?</font>

164
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,167
<font color="yellow">You need allowance money, right?</font>

165
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:23,878
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to see me</font>

166
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:27,590
<font color="yellow">leave your empty wallet
in the milk pouch.</font>

167
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:32,411
<font color="yellow">I'll fill it up with money for you.</font>

168
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:34,634
<font color="yellow">You can buy what you want to eat.</font>

169
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,784
<font color="yellow">Buy whatever else you want.</font>

170
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:40,316
<font color="yellow">Don't think bad thoughts
or do anything bad.</font>

171
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,080
<font color="yellow">You don't have to open the door
if you don't want to see your mom.</font>

172
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:50,293
<font color="yellow">I'm going to wait.</font>

173
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:51,734
<font color="yellow">I can wait as long as you need.</font>

174
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,349
<font color="yellow">I waited 10 years for you, Red.</font>

175
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,715
<font color="yellow">I can wait much longer if you need.</font>

176
00:10:57,715 --> 00:11:01,975
<font color="yellow">Don't starve and make sure
to buy food to eat.</font>

177
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,877
<font color="yellow">Open up the milk pouch.</font>

178
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:13,199
<font color="yellow">Looks good.</font>

179
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,437
<font color="yellow">Are they trying to buy their
daughter's love?</font>

180
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:31,734
<font color="yellow">What are they trying to teach her?</font>

181
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:38,896
<font color="yellow">It is the beautiful season of fall
where the skies become endless.</font>

182
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:43,993
<font color="yellow">However, these endlessly high skies
can bring great danger to some.</font>

183
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:46,933
<font color="yellow">This is an exclusive from
Reporter Lee Hwa Shin.</font>

184
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:04,446
<font color="yellow">I always believed that high places were
beautiful, but that is not always true.</font>

185
00:12:05,106 --> 00:12:08,279
<font color="yellow">I am currently at
highrise building in Seoul.</font>

186
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:10,672
<font color="yellow">I am outside of the 21st floor.</font>

187
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:13,141
<font color="yellow">According to the industrial safety manual</font>

188
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:15,355
<font color="yellow">when the wind velocity
exceeds 10 meters per second</font>

189
00:12:15,355 --> 00:12:17,994
<font color="yellow">no one must be outside cleaning windows.</font>

190
00:12:17,994 --> 00:12:22,692
<font color="yellow">In reality, the work is being done
even at winds of 18 meters per second.</font>

191
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:24,994
<font color="yellow">Sir, how are the winds today?</font>

192
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,027
<font color="yellow">This is considered to be a gentle breeze.</font>

193
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:29,747
<font color="yellow">We have to work unless it's a typhoon.</font>

194
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:32,114
<font color="yellow">Don't you have to stop when it's raining?</font>

195
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:35,831
<font color="yellow">They say the dirt will come off better,
so we have to work when it rains.</font>

196
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:37,047
<font color="yellow">Yes, I see.</font>

197
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:42,027
<font color="yellow"><i>This is the prime season in which
much of the window cleaning is done.</i></font>

198
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,489
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately, the...</font>

199
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:48,029
<font color="yellow">the accidents and deaths related to
window cleaning have been on the rise.</font>

200
00:12:48,031 --> 00:12:50,638
<font color="yellow">Today, I hid the fact
that I was a reporter</font>

201
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:54,022
<font color="yellow">and called a window cleaning business.</font>

202
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:59,422
<font color="yellow">Within five minutes, I received a call to
put me to work at highrise building.</font>

203
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:01,800
<font color="yellow">They gave me a few things
before I started.</font>

204
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,135
<font color="yellow">A safety instruction session
that lasted less than one hour.</font>

205
00:13:04,135 --> 00:13:08,860
<font color="yellow">This single rope that is deficient
according to the safety standards.</font>

206
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,071
<font color="yellow">A shelf that I can
barely manage to sit on.</font>

207
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:12,474
<font color="yellow">A few cleaning tools.</font>

208
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:13,968
<font color="yellow">Also...</font>

209
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:16,043
<font color="yellow">The weather is nice.</font>

210
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:18,526
<font color="yellow">- Yes, it's fall now.
- Yes.</font>

211
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:21,205
<font color="yellow">This coffee is nice.</font>

212
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:32,983
<font color="yellow">There is a safety tool
for moments like this.</font>

213
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:37,744
<font color="yellow">It is this plunger.</font>

214
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:44,162
<font color="yellow">As you can see,
it is not particularly effective.</font>

215
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:11,060
<font color="yellow">I apologize for alarming the viewers.</font>

216
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,644
<font color="yellow">However, the shoe that fell
could have been me.</font>

217
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:21,284
<font color="yellow">That goes to show that I have nothing
keeping me safe and no safety tools!</font>

218
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:26,065
<font color="yellow">As for the industrial safety standards
manual for window cleaners</font>

219
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,245
<font color="yellow">who exactly is making sure
these rules are followed?</font>

220
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:32,874
<font color="yellow">Some see the sky from inside,
and some see the sky from out here.</font>

221
00:14:32,874 --> 00:14:36,157
<font color="yellow">It should be beautiful to us all.</font>

222
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:39,407
<font color="yellow">This is Reporter Lee Hwa Shin from SBC.</font>

223
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:44,576
<font color="yellow">Good work, everyone!</font>

224
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:47,838
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that made me nervous.
What's with that guy?</font>

225
00:14:47,838 --> 00:14:51,287
<font color="yellow">Is he determined to die
just because his brother died?</font>

226
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:53,041
<font color="yellow">He won't die.</font>

227
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:56,210
<font color="yellow">When people are determined to die,
they usually don't end up dying.</font>

228
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,870
<font color="yellow">You were reassigned to 6 a.m. weather.
What are you doing here?</font>

229
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,181
<font color="yellow">Why are you hanging around here?</font>

230
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,576
<font color="yellow">Go to the work dorm rooms and sleep.</font>

231
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:09,819
<font color="yellow">It's only 8:00 p.m. How can I sleep?</font>

232
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:13,861
<font color="yellow">Bye, now. Reporter Lee!</font>

233
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:20,868
<font color="yellow">How was I today?</font>

234
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:23,374
<font color="yellow">Not great.</font>

235
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:25,540
<font color="yellow">Exactly what was not great and why?</font>

236
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,648
<font color="yellow">Just everything.</font>

237
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:29,585
<font color="yellow">Did you even hear me do my anchor part?</font>

238
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,707
<font color="yellow">Your story was not so great either.</font>

239
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:34,975
<font color="yellow">No, mine was perfect.</font>

240
00:15:44,099 --> 00:15:46,047
<font color="yellow">Look at that.</font>

241
00:15:46,047 --> 00:15:49,728
<font color="yellow">It's not just me he doesn't
want to talk to or even look at.</font>

242
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:03,104
<font color="yellow">Don't even think of coming here again.</font>

243
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,749
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

244
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:25,769
<font color="yellow">Now that Joong Shin is gone,
these are all withering away too.</font>

245
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:35,635
<font color="yellow">How dare she show up here?</font>

246
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:44,426
<font color="yellow">I left you many messages
so I'm sure you got them.</font>

247
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:46,697
<font color="yellow">I'm going to live with Red now.</font>

248
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:52,486
<font color="yellow">If I take this court,
I will get parental and custody rights.</font>

249
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:53,868
<font color="yellow">What do you think that means?</font>

250
00:16:53,868 --> 00:16:56,788
<font color="yellow">It means that the law
sides with the mother</font>

251
00:16:56,788 --> 00:16:58,476
<font color="yellow">who went through labor and gave birth.</font>

252
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:02,510
<font color="yellow">How does the dirt taste?</font>

253
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,647
<font color="yellow">Joong Shin is buried in the dirt.</font>

254
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:07,730
<font color="yellow">You're alive and well,
eating with that mouth of yours</font>

255
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,801
<font color="yellow">and spewing that terrible nonsense.</font>

256
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:12,350
<font color="yellow">How did a wench like you
come into my house?</font>

257
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,796
<font color="yellow">You only had the child and ran.</font>

258
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:16,554
<font color="yellow">Is that a mother?</font>

259
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:21,127
<font color="yellow">Even if you gave birth 1,000 times,
Red wouldn't go to you!</font>

260
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,926
<font color="yellow">You should tell the truth.</font>

261
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:27,305
<font color="yellow">I didn't throw Red away!
You took her from me.</font>

262
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:31,296
<font color="yellow">You made Red hate me and you made
a mother and daughter grow apart.</font>

263
00:17:31,296 --> 00:17:33,362
<font color="yellow">This is all your fault!</font>

264
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:36,772
<font color="yellow">Red is my daughter. She's mine!</font>

265
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:00,400
<font color="yellow">Just a bit.</font>

266
00:18:59,686 --> 00:19:01,833
<font color="yellow">I want to respect your tastes.</font>

267
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,033
<font color="yellow">So, pick out what you like first.</font>

268
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:06,834
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to sponsor
my outfit every time I go on air?</font>

269
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:09,464
<font color="yellow">The dressing room is over there.</font>

270
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:17,593
<font color="yellow">How much is this?</font>

271
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,600
<font color="yellow">There's no price tag.</font>

272
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,168
<font color="yellow">Your mother is here.</font>

273
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:43,760
<font color="yellow">Hello, President.</font>

274
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,859
<font color="yellow">Oh, hello.</font>

275
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:47,927
<font color="yellow">Mother, why didn't you call beforehand?</font>

276
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:51,995
<font color="yellow">I wanted to pick some clothes out
for Announcer Geum.</font>

277
00:19:55,745 --> 00:19:59,433
<font color="yellow">Madam, Announcer Geum usually
wears the clothes on the first floor.</font>

278
00:19:59,434 --> 00:20:01,936
<font color="yellow">- Let's go to the first floor.
- First floor?</font>

279
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:04,132
<font color="yellow">Why would I dress
my future daughter-in-law</font>

280
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:05,414
<font color="yellow">in clothes on the first floor?</font>

281
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:07,636
<font color="yellow">Is that what you've been doing?</font>

282
00:20:08,836 --> 00:20:12,177
<font color="yellow">Let's get your wedding dress
from here too, Announcer Geum.</font>

283
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,830
<font color="yellow">If you choose it for me, Mother,
I would like that.</font>

284
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,007
<font color="yellow">We don't sell wedding dresses.</font>

285
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:20,832
<font color="yellow">You should look into
wedding dresses at a bigger place.</font>

286
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:23,628
<font color="yellow">You can go to Italy yourself
and look into it.</font>

287
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:27,184
<font color="yellow">You're always in Milan,
so it's no big deal for you.</font>

288
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,058
<font color="yellow">Why would you get it elsewhere?</font>

289
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:31,487
<font color="yellow">What kind of manner is this toward
the person you're going to marry?</font>

290
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:34,127
<font color="yellow"><i>What do you mean marry?
We haven't even gone on a date, right?</i></font>

291
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:38,775
<font color="yellow">If you move too fast like this,
it's rude to Announcer Geum.</font>

292
00:20:38,775 --> 00:20:41,583
<font color="yellow">We can date after we marry.
My brother did that too.</font>

293
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:43,925
<font color="yellow">He's very happy now.</font>

294
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:49,151
<font color="yellow">She says all the right things,
doesn't she, Jung Won?</font>

295
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:54,123
<font color="yellow">This is why I want an announcer
daughter-in-law like her.</font>

296
00:20:54,123 --> 00:20:56,096
<font color="yellow">Then, look around.</font>

297
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,986
<font color="yellow">Come. Look around.</font>

298
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,660
<font color="yellow">Well, we're not in a relationship</font>

299
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:15,019
<font color="yellow">where we have to be concerned
about these things.</font>

300
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:17,998
<font color="yellow">What is our relationship?</font>

301
00:21:20,785 --> 00:21:21,935
<font color="yellow">Just tasting.</font>

302
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,004
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you're
getting a taste of me?</font>

303
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:28,475
<font color="yellow">Can I get a taste of a rich man?</font>

304
00:21:30,318 --> 00:21:31,926
<font color="yellow">How is it now that you've had a taste?</font>

305
00:21:32,377 --> 00:21:33,485
<font color="yellow">Salty?</font>

306
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:36,145
<font color="yellow">Spicy?</font>

307
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:38,503
<font color="yellow">Sour?</font>

308
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:43,824
<font color="yellow">Sweet.</font>

309
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,620
<font color="yellow">It's incredibly scary.</font>

310
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,903
<font color="yellow">Then, have a taste.</font>

311
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,829
<font color="yellow">People have a taste
even when they eat stew.</font>

312
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:54,126
<font color="yellow">You should have a taste of a man
you might have a relationship with.</font>

313
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:06,649
<font color="yellow">Your surgery went well
and your scar is healing nicely.</font>

314
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:08,418
<font color="yellow">I don't think you need to worry.</font>

315
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,459
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

316
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:15,219
<font color="yellow">Lee Hwa Shin hasn't come to his
appointments or for radiation at all.</font>

317
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:16,407
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

318
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:18,977
<font color="yellow">He hasn't come for
radiation therapy at all?</font>

319
00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:22,425
<font color="yellow">I told him it could come back
and he must get radiation therapy.</font>

320
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,329
<font color="yellow">I told him more than 100 times.</font>

321
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:27,553
<font color="yellow">He must think a
doctor's word is bullcrap.</font>

322
00:22:27,553 --> 00:22:30,524
<font color="yellow">Is he possessed by a ghost
who doesn't listen to people?</font>

323
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:32,794
<font color="yellow">Does he hate me? Why isn't he coming?</font>

324
00:22:33,244 --> 00:22:35,646
<font color="yellow">The breast cancer clinic is full of women</font>

325
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,434
<font color="yellow">like a women's bath locker room.</font>

326
00:22:37,434 --> 00:22:39,263
<font color="yellow">Is he scared of rumors?</font>

327
00:22:39,263 --> 00:22:43,725
<font color="yellow">Is he more scared of rumors
than the cancer coming back?</font>

328
00:22:43,725 --> 00:22:47,830
<font color="yellow">Even if it's stage one,
a recurring cancer can spread so fast.</font>

329
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,740
<font color="yellow">Is he crazy or something?</font>

330
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,910
<font color="yellow">I guess he must be determined
to die early or something.</font>

331
00:23:03,322 --> 00:23:05,802
<font color="yellow">What did I do so wrong
that he's so angry anyway?</font>

332
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,382
<font color="yellow">He ignores me all the time,
so why should I?</font>

333
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:15,740
<font color="yellow">Oh, Reporter Lee!</font>

334
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:18,889
<font color="yellow">What is it? Did you get kicked out?</font>

335
00:23:18,889 --> 00:23:20,911
<font color="yellow">Huh? Did you get kicked out?</font>

336
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:23,298
<font color="yellow">Reporter, Reporter...</font>

337
00:23:34,238 --> 00:23:36,632
<font color="yellow"><i>Pyo Na Ri, bring him here.</i></font>

338
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,813
<font color="yellow">What? Why should I?</font>

339
00:23:40,394 --> 00:23:45,721
<font color="yellow">Besides the doctors and you,
who else knows that he has breast cancer?</font>

340
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:47,949
<font color="yellow">Aren't you two dating?</font>

341
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,500
<font color="yellow">No, we are not.</font>

342
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,350
<font color="yellow"><i>Then, should we leave him to die?</i></font>

343
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:57,842
<font color="yellow"><i>Breast cancer patients have symptoms
similar to menopausal women post-surgery.</i></font>

344
00:23:57,842 --> 00:24:00,247
<font color="yellow"><i>They're very sensitive and emotional.</i></font>

345
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:05,016
<font color="yellow"><i>Doctors consider them to be the
most difficult of the cancer patients.</i></font>

346
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:07,294
<font color="yellow"><i>Men with breast cancer could be the same.</i></font>

347
00:24:07,294 --> 00:24:10,746
<font color="yellow"><i>There's a good chance
Reporter Lee Hwa Shin is in that state.</i></font>

348
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:12,659
<font color="yellow"><i>That must be why he's not coming.</i></font>

349
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,240
<font color="yellow">Yeah, let's just let him die then.</font>

350
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,530
<font color="yellow">Yes, that would be better.</font>

351
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,227
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is getting on my nerves.</font>

352
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:26,891
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?
He's acting like I don't exist.</font>

353
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,818
<font color="yellow"><i>Pyo Na Ri, bring him here.</i></font>

354
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:22,125
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I don't know. He can die or not.</font>

355
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,076
<font color="yellow">I don't know anymore.</font>

356
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:41,906
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you want me to go to
radiation therapy with you tomorrow?</i></font>

357
00:25:41,906 --> 00:25:43,600
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll go with you.</i></font>

358
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:16,582
<font color="yellow">Go to the bathroom and
just sleep. Sleep, okay?</font>

359
00:26:44,418 --> 00:26:47,949
<font color="yellow">How did you know that I'd be here?</font>

360
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:50,218
<font color="yellow">It's obvious, man.</font>

361
00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:55,327
<font color="yellow">Were you busy until now?</font>

362
00:26:56,068 --> 00:26:58,447
<font color="yellow">Let's just go to sleep.</font>

363
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:00,636
<font color="yellow">I was on a flight
so I couldn't sleep at all.</font>

364
00:27:00,636 --> 00:27:03,716
<font color="yellow">Then why did you come?
You should go home and sleep.</font>

365
00:27:03,716 --> 00:27:07,376
<font color="yellow">You got kicked out of your house.
I came here to get you.</font>

366
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,785
<font color="yellow">Mom sure talks a lot.</font>

367
00:27:09,785 --> 00:27:13,090
<font color="yellow">It's obvious why your mom told my mom.</font>

368
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,322
<font color="yellow">She's saying, "Stay at Jung Won's house."</font>

369
00:27:15,322 --> 00:27:17,545
<font color="yellow">I don't want to live according
to my mom's expectations.</font>

370
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:19,844
<font color="yellow">- Let's sleep at my place.
- I'm comfortable here.</font>

371
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:22,568
<font color="yellow">It's too narrow for me.</font>

372
00:27:22,568 --> 00:27:24,495
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Stop being gross.</font>

373
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:27,516
<font color="yellow">Since you've been kicked out,
come live with me.</font>

374
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:30,218
<font color="yellow">I'll be the wife.</font>

375
00:27:31,195 --> 00:27:33,322
<font color="yellow">You know my entry code.</font>

376
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:36,869
<font color="yellow">You could've gone even if I wasn't home.
Why are you suffering here?</font>

377
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:40,439
<font color="yellow">Just go home.</font>

378
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:43,300
<font color="yellow">Let's just go to my place.</font>

379
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,706
<font color="yellow">I have to go film on scene
early tomorrow morning.</font>

380
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,459
<font color="yellow">I'm coming every day until you come.</font>

381
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,738
<font color="yellow">Stop with that and just go.</font>

382
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:51,940
<font color="yellow">Ah, I guess you're telling me
to come back tomorrow.</font>

383
00:27:57,781 --> 00:28:00,838
<font color="yellow">No woman can hold you like this.</font>

384
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,529
<font color="yellow">You crazy punk.</font>

385
00:28:09,173 --> 00:28:13,663
<font color="yellow">I... might not be as good as
your brother who passed away.</font>

386
00:28:13,663 --> 00:28:16,212
<font color="yellow">I'll be good to you like your brother.</font>

387
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:30,067
<font color="yellow">Joong Shin was a good person,
so I'm sure he's in a good place.</font>

388
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:38,237
<font color="yellow">He will be wanting the best for you,
more than anyone, from up in heaven.</font>

389
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,756
<font color="yellow">Stop acting like a hedgehog
with its spines up.</font>

390
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,986
<font color="yellow">Be good to Red and your mother.</font>

391
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,208
<font color="yellow">As for you, I'll be good to you.</font>

392
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:00,649
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

393
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,978
<font color="yellow">- Okay?
- Okay.</font>

394
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,260
<font color="yellow">You said okay.</font>

395
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:10,533
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

396
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,533
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's sleep.</font>

397
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,709
<font color="yellow"><i>Make sure to just study.</i></font>

398
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:38,792
<font color="yellow"><i>You're very pretty so be careful of boys.</i></font>

399
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:40,016
<font color="yellow"><i>Okay?</i></font>

400
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:53,011
<font color="yellow">You like me, right?</font>

401
00:30:15,486 --> 00:30:19,023
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't think bad thoughts
or do anything bad. </i></font>

402
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:25,820
<font color="yellow">Hey! Let's go.</font>

403
00:30:29,442 --> 00:30:31,418
<font color="yellow">I should never have listened to you.</font>

404
00:30:32,878 --> 00:30:34,697
<font color="yellow">Don't you like me?</font>

405
00:31:17,117 --> 00:31:18,290
<font color="yellow">Oh!</font>

406
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:20,307
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

407
00:31:20,307 --> 00:31:22,484
<font color="yellow">I thought you were a ghost!</font>

408
00:31:22,484 --> 00:31:24,770
<font color="yellow">- Where's your phone?
- What? Why?</font>

409
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,300
<font color="yellow">Why? Why?</font>

410
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:29,259
<font color="yellow">Wait, Reporter!</font>

411
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:35,785
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking for my phone?</font>

412
00:31:35,785 --> 00:31:37,090
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

413
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:41,151
<font color="yellow">- Do you really not know?
- What, what?</font>

414
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:44,253
<font color="yellow">Is it that video from the hospital?</font>

415
00:31:44,253 --> 00:31:48,741
<font color="yellow">I saw you showing it to Jung Won.</font>

416
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:55,801
<font color="yellow">Ah... that's why you've been ignoring me
and treating me like crap.</font>

417
00:31:56,543 --> 00:31:58,359
<font color="yellow">I told you, didn't I?</font>

418
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:02,310
<font color="yellow">The moment anyone else sees that video,
both you and I will die.</font>

419
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,532
<font color="yellow">Yes, you are right. You are.</font>

420
00:32:05,532 --> 00:32:07,338
<font color="yellow">You and I both are going to die.</font>

421
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:09,603
<font color="yellow">I will die because I showed
the video to your friend.</font>

422
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:12,666
<font color="yellow">You'll die because you're not
getting radiation therapy.</font>

423
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,452
<font color="yellow">Don't change the topic and give it to me.</font>

424
00:32:15,704 --> 00:32:20,155
<font color="yellow">But how come you're not getting the
radiation therapy? Why?</font>

425
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:24,636
<font color="yellow">Doctor Geum said that you could relapse
and it will spread quickly.</font>

426
00:32:24,636 --> 00:32:26,943
<font color="yellow">She's throwing a fit
saying you're in danger.</font>

427
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:29,044
<font color="yellow">Do you think you have two or three lives?</font>

428
00:32:29,044 --> 00:32:33,385
<font color="yellow">You promised to go every day
and get the radiation for six weeks.</font>

429
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:35,821
<font color="yellow">Isn't that why you got partial removal?</font>

430
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,320
<font color="yellow">My brother is dead.</font>

431
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,821
<font color="yellow">How can I try to live a long life
on my own like that?</font>

432
00:32:43,821 --> 00:32:46,636
<font color="yellow">Do I have to be diligent about
radiation therapy when he just died?</font>

433
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:48,725
<font color="yellow">You think I'm that heartless?</font>

434
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:51,498
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't care if
my brother died or not.</font>

435
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:54,557
<font color="yellow">I got surgery to be
healthy and live long.</font>

436
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:58,622
<font color="yellow">Now I have to get radiation therapy?
I'd rather just live like this.</font>

437
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:03,262
<font color="yellow">No, I'm so apologetic to my brother that
I want to live a bit less than others.</font>

438
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:05,850
<font color="yellow">I just want to go to my brother,
so don't concern yourself with it.</font>

439
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,199
<font color="yellow">Just give me your phone now.</font>

440
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:13,619
<font color="yellow">If you want to die so quickly,
why do you care about that darn video?</font>

441
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,015
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously!</font>

442
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:18,619
<font color="yellow">Even if I die,
I can't die so shamefully.</font>

443
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:21,776
<font color="yellow">If you're going to die,
who cares about being embarrassed?</font>

444
00:33:21,776 --> 00:33:22,895
<font color="yellow">Is that so important?</font>

445
00:33:22,895 --> 00:33:24,561
<font color="yellow">You can die or not.</font>

446
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:30,503
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

447
00:33:31,857 --> 00:33:33,716
<font color="yellow">What if I'd been sleeping
in my underwear?</font>

448
00:33:33,716 --> 00:33:35,977
<font color="yellow">Yesterday I was sleeping in my underwear!</font>

449
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:37,498
<font color="yellow">You're in sweatpants.</font>

450
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:40,159
<font color="yellow">Oh my! Where are you groping?</font>

451
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,432
<font color="yellow">Where is it?</font>

452
00:33:41,827 --> 00:33:43,987
<font color="yellow">Where are you touching me?</font>

453
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:46,846
<font color="yellow">- This is sexual harassment!
- Sexual harassment? What a joke.</font>

454
00:33:46,846 --> 00:33:48,505
<font color="yellow">If you didn't like me searching like this</font>

455
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:50,505
<font color="yellow">you would've stood up by now.</font>

456
00:33:50,505 --> 00:33:52,343
<font color="yellow">You still like me, don't you?</font>

457
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:54,928
<font color="yellow">I told you I don't! Seriously!</font>

458
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:57,011
<font color="yellow">I don't have the phone!</font>

459
00:33:57,011 --> 00:34:00,472
<font color="yellow">I looked everywhere and it's not here.</font>

460
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:03,513
<font color="yellow">Do you sleep with the phone
hidden on your body?</font>

461
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,262
<font color="yellow">What, what? What?</font>

462
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:14,993
<font color="yellow">- You want me to undress?
- Why would you?</font>

463
00:34:14,993 --> 00:34:19,563
<font color="yellow">You getting undressed
is my worst fear in life.</font>

464
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:22,469
<font color="yellow">Turn your pockets inside out.
Don't expect me to search you anymore.</font>

465
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,712
<font color="yellow">Here, look.</font>

466
00:34:25,712 --> 00:34:28,221
<font color="yellow">It's not here, right?</font>

467
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:29,529
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

468
00:34:29,529 --> 00:34:32,346
<font color="yellow">It's empty, right? Empty, empty!</font>

469
00:34:32,348 --> 00:34:33,918
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

470
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:39,250
<font color="yellow">You sent me a text message earlier.
Where did you put your phone?</font>

471
00:34:57,897 --> 00:34:59,824
<font color="yellow"><i>[Weathercaster Dressing Room]</i></font>

472
00:35:03,975 --> 00:35:06,333
<font color="yellow">Oh! What are you doing?</font>

473
00:35:08,054 --> 00:35:10,116
<font color="yellow">Then, go get radiation therapy
with me tomorrow.</font>

474
00:35:10,116 --> 00:35:13,243
<font color="yellow">I will delete it in front of you then.</font>

475
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:14,690
<font color="yellow">Stop trying to make things happen.</font>

476
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,335
<font color="yellow">You're trying to get involved with me
and try something again.</font>

477
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:18,955
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

478
00:35:18,955 --> 00:35:20,665
<font color="yellow">All right, all right.</font>

479
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:22,572
<font color="yellow">It's because you feel
like you're going to</font>

480
00:35:22,572 --> 00:35:24,478
<font color="yellow">a women's bath locker room, right?</font>

481
00:35:24,478 --> 00:35:30,476
<font color="yellow">I will pretend to be the patient and
you can pretend to be my guardian.</font>

482
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,784
<font color="yellow">I have the breast cancer
and you're just the guardian.</font>

483
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:38,826
<font color="yellow">I don't think anyone will think it's odd.
There won't be any rumors.</font>

484
00:35:40,714 --> 00:35:41,982
<font color="yellow">Really.</font>

485
00:35:41,982 --> 00:35:44,011
<font color="yellow">Have you ever seen the impossible happen?</font>

486
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,971
<font color="yellow">I won't ever trust you again.
I can't trust you.</font>

487
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:49,969
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

488
00:35:55,898 --> 00:35:58,665
<font color="yellow">Seriously! Gosh...</font>

489
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,831
<font color="yellow">Should I buy you a phone?</font>

490
00:36:02,831 --> 00:36:04,342
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

491
00:36:12,982 --> 00:36:14,331
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey!</font>

492
00:36:16,063 --> 00:36:19,540
<font color="yellow">Hey! Let's go buy
a phone tomorrow, okay?</font>

493
00:36:20,697 --> 00:36:24,248
<font color="yellow">Let's go buy a phone together.</font>

494
00:36:24,857 --> 00:36:26,188
<font color="yellow">Together?</font>

495
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:33,069
<font color="yellow">There will never be anything
you and I do together, ever.</font>

496
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:34,938
<font color="yellow">That's what I wanted.</font>

497
00:36:34,938 --> 00:36:37,214
<font color="yellow">Still, I'll buy you a phone.</font>

498
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:42,085
<font color="yellow">Get out! Don't you know that
men aren't allowed in here?</font>

499
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:44,134
<font color="yellow">What's going on with you two?</font>

500
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,110
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. Let's go.</font>

501
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:57,549
<font color="yellow">Why are you two fighting in here
when you were sleeping before?</font>

502
00:36:58,228 --> 00:36:59,618
<font color="yellow">We don't really get along.</font>

503
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:02,002
<font color="yellow">- He's my enemy.
- Look who's talking.</font>

504
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:04,525
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee put my phone in the toilet.</font>

505
00:37:04,525 --> 00:37:06,194
<font color="yellow">Her phone? Why?</font>

506
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:08,485
<font color="yellow">I said I'd buy you a new one.</font>

507
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:10,743
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is about the phone?</font>

508
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:14,123
<font color="yellow">I had important pictures and videos--</font>

509
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:19,971
<font color="yellow">There were so many
important things on there!</font>

510
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,382
<font color="yellow">There were pictures of my mom</font>

511
00:37:21,382 --> 00:37:24,822
<font color="yellow">things I can't forget,
and everything else.</font>

512
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,098
<font color="yellow">What's with you?</font>

513
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:29,337
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's because
of the video of you?</font>

514
00:37:29,337 --> 00:37:30,596
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth!</font>

515
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:32,875
<font color="yellow">What? That thing?</font>

516
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:35,746
<font color="yellow">I have it here, too.</font>

517
00:37:35,746 --> 00:37:37,850
<font color="yellow">I thought it was fun and nice.</font>

518
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:41,572
<font color="yellow">Did you throw her phone in the toilet
because she secretly filmed that?</font>

519
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,547
<font color="yellow">Here. You can throw mine
in the toilet too.</font>

520
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:46,567
<font color="yellow">This put me in a good mood
every time I watched it</font>

521
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:49,080
<font color="yellow">so I even got her to send it to me.</font>

522
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,072
<font color="yellow">You hated it that much?</font>

523
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:52,848
<font color="yellow">Then go ahead and throw mine out too.</font>

524
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:02,922
<font color="yellow">Hey, I know your brother's dead but...</font>

525
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:05,339
<font color="yellow">you're being oversensitive like a girl.</font>

526
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:06,842
<font color="yellow">Whose side are you on right now?</font>

527
00:38:09,645 --> 00:38:11,228
<font color="yellow">You're just the same.</font>

528
00:38:12,638 --> 00:38:16,746
<font color="yellow">The two of you watched that video
and laughed at me.</font>

529
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:21,076
<font color="yellow">You saw it but didn't even tell me
and you alienated me.</font>

530
00:38:21,076 --> 00:38:24,505
<font color="yellow">It is worth laughing at a bit.
How can you not laugh at that?</font>

531
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:25,690
<font color="yellow">You punk.</font>

532
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,212
<font color="yellow">You're going to curse at me now?</font>

533
00:38:27,212 --> 00:38:29,250
<font color="yellow">- You wench and punk.
- Reporter!</font>

534
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,264
<font color="yellow">I have the right to that video.</font>

535
00:38:32,264 --> 00:38:35,502
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going too far
with a sick person?</font>

536
00:38:35,502 --> 00:38:36,605
<font color="yellow">Are you sick?</font>

537
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,514
<font color="yellow">You already know, so why are you asking?</font>

538
00:38:38,868 --> 00:38:41,143
<font color="yellow">If you were going to pretend not
to know then continue doing that.</font>

539
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:42,313
<font color="yellow">What are you sick with?</font>

540
00:38:42,313 --> 00:38:44,944
<font color="yellow">You should know if you saw
the video of me in that br--</font>

541
00:38:44,944 --> 00:38:46,444
<font color="yellow">Let go!</font>

542
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:49,636
<font color="yellow">- Are you crazy?
- His chest...</font>

543
00:38:50,147 --> 00:38:52,268
<font color="yellow">His chest hurts.</font>

544
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:55,920
<font color="yellow">Because he lost his brother,
I think he's a bit traumatized.</font>

545
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,223
<font color="yellow">Since that funeral,
how should I put it...</font>

546
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:02,377
<font color="yellow">He says that he's in pain here and there.</font>

547
00:39:02,377 --> 00:39:04,531
<font color="yellow">He keeps whining
and it's driving me nuts.</font>

548
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:07,243
<font color="yellow">If you're feeling sick,
why don't you take time off?</font>

549
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:14,134
<font color="yellow">What do we do about Red?</font>

550
00:39:24,215 --> 00:39:25,386
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

551
00:39:25,782 --> 00:39:26,844
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

552
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:28,706
<font color="yellow">Why, you little...</font>

553
00:39:28,706 --> 00:39:31,815
<font color="yellow">Where did you roll in from,
you rude thing?</font>

554
00:39:31,815 --> 00:39:33,815
<font color="yellow">Listen to you.</font>

555
00:39:33,815 --> 00:39:35,643
<font color="yellow">Are you a couple?</font>

556
00:39:36,321 --> 00:39:38,022
<font color="yellow">Who knew...</font>

557
00:39:38,822 --> 00:39:41,857
<font color="yellow">You laugh? Are you laughing? Apologize.</font>

558
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:44,813
<font color="yellow">Let go and talk. Let go.</font>

559
00:39:44,837 --> 00:39:46,810
<font color="yellow">I knew she'd cause trouble.</font>

560
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:49,293
<font color="yellow">She came here to cause trouble.</font>

561
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:03,853
<font color="yellow">Where's Lee Hwa Shin?
Everything is all set up.</font>

562
00:40:03,853 --> 00:40:06,397
<font color="yellow">- Where is he?
- Hurry up and find him.</font>

563
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:08,871
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin! Hwa Shin!</font>

564
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:11,703
<font color="yellow">Bastard Hwa Shin! You bastard!</font>

565
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:16,826
<font color="yellow">This is what Pyo Na Ri showed you?</font>

566
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:20,924
<font color="yellow">She thought it was great how hard you
practiced when you refused to do it.</font>

567
00:41:20,924 --> 00:41:22,206
<font color="yellow">So she secretly filmed it.</font>

568
00:41:22,206 --> 00:41:25,089
<font color="yellow">She says you do it better than anyone
when you set your mind to it.</font>

569
00:41:25,089 --> 00:41:27,147
<font color="yellow">She said it was cool and she envied you.</font>

570
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:31,125
<font color="yellow">Well, who told her to film this?</font>

571
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,107
<font color="yellow">I'm fine with it.</font>

572
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:36,165
<font color="yellow">It was a bit harsh to curse at Pyo Na Ri.</font>

573
00:41:36,165 --> 00:41:37,304
<font color="yellow">You should apologize.</font>

574
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:39,815
<font color="yellow">Why should I apologize?</font>

575
00:41:42,397 --> 00:41:44,647
<font color="yellow">Is he going through menopause
or something?</font>

576
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:46,915
<font color="yellow">Why is he acting so out of character?</font>

577
00:41:51,685 --> 00:41:54,366
<font color="yellow">Hello? The police station?</font>

578
00:41:57,717 --> 00:41:59,746
<font color="yellow">You'd better apologize now.</font>

579
00:41:59,746 --> 00:42:00,976
<font color="yellow">Be quiet!</font>

580
00:42:02,098 --> 00:42:04,259
<font color="yellow">What's your name? Tell us now.</font>

581
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:07,828
<font color="yellow">What's your name?</font>

582
00:42:09,855 --> 00:42:12,638
<font color="yellow">- It's Lee Red.
- Lee Red.</font>

583
00:42:12,638 --> 00:42:13,926
<font color="yellow">Resident ID number?</font>

584
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:17,217
<font color="yellow">How old are you?</font>

585
00:42:23,545 --> 00:42:25,656
<font color="yellow">Hey! Red, you...</font>

586
00:42:25,656 --> 00:42:28,498
<font color="yellow">Are you going to keep taking my clothes
and going to clubs?</font>

587
00:42:28,498 --> 00:42:31,027
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you insinuating that
my Red is a thief?</font>

588
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:32,353
<font color="yellow">Who called this lady anyway?</font>

589
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:34,196
<font color="yellow">I called her.</font>

590
00:42:34,196 --> 00:42:36,817
<font color="yellow">We were the ones taking in money
during the funeral.</font>

591
00:42:36,817 --> 00:42:39,469
<font color="yellow">That announcer lady gave the most.</font>

592
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:41,701
<font color="yellow">- How much did she give?
- Who called this lady?</font>

593
00:42:41,701 --> 00:42:44,072
<font color="yellow">That anchor lady said
that she was your mom</font>

594
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:46,442
<font color="yellow">and told me to call if anything happened.</font>

595
00:42:46,442 --> 00:42:48,201
<font color="yellow">I'm her only real family.</font>

596
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:50,603
<font color="yellow">These people are all strangers,
so call me if anything happens.</font>

597
00:42:50,603 --> 00:42:54,214
<font color="yellow">You say you're her real family yet
you didn't come see her for three years?</font>

598
00:42:54,214 --> 00:42:56,011
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just accept rent
if you're the landlord?</font>

599
00:42:56,011 --> 00:42:58,578
<font color="yellow">Her real uncle is here
so you can stop pretending.</font>

600
00:42:58,578 --> 00:43:00,891
<font color="yellow">Hey, Mister.
Don't talk to my uncle like that.</font>

601
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:02,891
<font color="yellow">Red, I'm your uncle.</font>

602
00:43:02,891 --> 00:43:04,793
<font color="yellow">Yeah, don't talk to Hwa Shin like that,
Uncle and Red.</font>

603
00:43:04,793 --> 00:43:08,185
<font color="yellow">Aren't minors not allowed in that club?</font>

604
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:11,837
<font color="yellow">Whose idea was it to go?
Dae Gu? Red, it was you right?</font>

605
00:43:11,837 --> 00:43:13,574
<font color="yellow">Hey! It wasn't Red!</font>

606
00:43:13,574 --> 00:43:17,272
<font color="yellow">Obviously these boys convinced her to go.</font>

607
00:43:17,272 --> 00:43:18,940
<font color="yellow">Dae Gu is not like that.</font>

608
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:22,221
<font color="yellow">Just hang out with Dae Gu.
Don't hang out with Red anymore.</font>

609
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:24,835
<font color="yellow">Why are you picking on Red?</font>

610
00:43:25,455 --> 00:43:29,395
<font color="yellow">Red, move out of that villa.
Come live with me.</font>

611
00:43:29,395 --> 00:43:33,007
<font color="yellow">If you leave that villa,
you won't have to be around those people.</font>

612
00:43:33,007 --> 00:43:35,404
<font color="yellow">Come with Mom. Let's go to my house.</font>

613
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,659
<font color="yellow">Let go of her.</font>

614
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:37,840
<font color="yellow">- Chi Yeol.
- Yeah?</font>

615
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,976
<font color="yellow">- Dae Gu.
- Yeah?</font>

616
00:43:38,976 --> 00:43:41,447
<font color="yellow">How did you guys feel having
your first kiss with me today?</font>

617
00:43:43,127 --> 00:43:45,241
<font color="yellow">- You...
- Let go.</font>

618
00:43:45,241 --> 00:43:47,311
<font color="yellow">It's not true, right?</font>

619
00:43:47,311 --> 00:43:49,228
<font color="yellow">It wasn't Red, right?</font>

620
00:43:49,228 --> 00:43:51,011
<font color="yellow">- You can do it at your age, but...
- Don't worry.</font>

621
00:43:51,011 --> 00:43:53,601
<font color="yellow">Is it true? Come with me.</font>

622
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:55,681
<font color="yellow">They are so lame.</font>

623
00:43:59,163 --> 00:44:00,839
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time, Rich Bro.</font>

624
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,978
<font color="yellow">You should call me Uncle.
I'm your uncle's friend.</font>

625
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:05,333
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

626
00:44:07,933 --> 00:44:10,371
<font color="yellow">She's lying right now.</font>

627
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:12,878
<font color="yellow">From what I know,
her first kiss was in junior high.</font>

628
00:44:12,878 --> 00:44:14,906
<font color="yellow">It's not a big deal, so don't worry.</font>

629
00:44:14,906 --> 00:44:20,096
<font color="yellow">Also, Red will be living
at her grandma's house.</font>

630
00:44:20,096 --> 00:44:21,987
<font color="yellow">You two should stay out of it.</font>

631
00:44:21,987 --> 00:44:23,534
<font color="yellow">Junior high?</font>

632
00:44:23,534 --> 00:44:24,864
<font color="yellow">Why does he get to decide?</font>

633
00:44:24,864 --> 00:44:26,721
<font color="yellow">How is it not a big deal?</font>

634
00:44:26,721 --> 00:44:31,353
<font color="yellow">She calls her uncle "Mister" and
calls her mom "some lady." What a mess.</font>

635
00:44:31,353 --> 00:44:34,993
<font color="yellow">That girl has a dirty temper
because she takes after me.</font>

636
00:44:35,603 --> 00:44:37,223
<font color="yellow">So, you do know.</font>

637
00:44:38,297 --> 00:44:41,982
<font color="yellow">You have full makeup on right now?
Red was at the police station!</font>

638
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:45,196
<font color="yellow">That's why you're not a mom.
You had time to do makeup?</font>

639
00:44:45,196 --> 00:44:48,094
<font color="yellow">I did live radio and
was eating with my staff.</font>

640
00:44:48,094 --> 00:44:51,074
<font color="yellow">Who has time to remove makeup when
my daughter is at the police station?</font>

641
00:44:51,074 --> 00:44:54,186
<font color="yellow">Why is it that you put on makeup
every time you do radio?</font>

642
00:44:54,186 --> 00:44:57,063
<font color="yellow">- What?
- You're always ready to meet a man.</font>

643
00:44:57,063 --> 00:44:59,603
<font color="yellow">- I've never seen you with a man though.
- Really?</font>

644
00:45:00,217 --> 00:45:02,304
<font color="yellow">I had my first kiss in junior high.</font>

645
00:45:02,304 --> 00:45:04,114
<font color="yellow">I guess Red takes after me in that way.</font>

646
00:45:04,114 --> 00:45:05,965
<font color="yellow">I am so proud of her.</font>

647
00:45:13,889 --> 00:45:15,766
<font color="yellow">Go on in, Red.</font>

648
00:45:15,766 --> 00:45:17,194
<font color="yellow">Goodnight, Red.</font>

649
00:45:17,194 --> 00:45:19,360
<font color="yellow">- Bye, Red.
- Go inside now.</font>

650
00:45:20,036 --> 00:45:22,942
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the ride.</font>

651
00:45:23,576 --> 00:45:25,293
<font color="yellow">No need to thank me.
Hey, Hwa Shin.</font>

652
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:28,603
<font color="yellow">Neither of you got any sleep
and you have to go to the station.</font>

653
00:45:28,603 --> 00:45:29,980
<font color="yellow">So let's go eat.</font>

654
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:32,638
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

655
00:45:35,203 --> 00:45:36,219
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

656
00:45:37,605 --> 00:45:38,788
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

657
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:40,795
<font color="yellow">Both of you.</font>

658
00:45:42,828 --> 00:45:46,493
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.
Let's go inside.</font>

659
00:45:54,804 --> 00:45:57,554
<font color="yellow">You and Chi Yeol did it too?</font>

660
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,583
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

661
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:14,203
<font color="yellow"><i>How did you guys feel having your
first kiss with me today?</i></font>

662
00:46:15,516 --> 00:46:16,822
<font color="yellow">What should we eat?</font>

663
00:46:17,893 --> 00:46:19,007
<font color="yellow">Get in.</font>

664
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:23,552
<font color="yellow">Sorry, but can I go in this car?</font>

665
00:46:26,552 --> 00:46:29,040
<font color="yellow">You don't need to ask.
Of course you can go in this car.</font>

666
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,690
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm just going to go to the station.</font>

667
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,043
<font color="yellow">How can you just go
after fighting like that?</font>

668
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:36,989
<font color="yellow">What about Pyo Na Ri's phone?
You have to take responsibility for it.</font>

669
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:39,851
<font color="yellow">Why should I take
responsibility? What for?</font>

670
00:46:39,851 --> 00:46:41,040
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything wrong.</font>

671
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,255
<font color="yellow">Let's go and resolve it.</font>

672
00:46:42,255 --> 00:46:43,590
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to resolve.</font>

673
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,545
<font color="yellow">Then was it right for a guy
to throw a phone into a toilet?</font>

674
00:46:46,545 --> 00:46:51,806
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll just set up a phone merchant
at the station, so get one there.</font>

675
00:46:51,806 --> 00:46:55,275
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're making me out
to be a petty person.</font>

676
00:46:55,275 --> 00:46:59,275
<font color="yellow">Seriously, did I ever
ask you for a phone?</font>

677
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,364
<font color="yellow">Yeah, an apology should come first.</font>

678
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:03,650
<font color="yellow">Forget the phone.</font>

679
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:06,268
<font color="yellow">I may have said that I liked
getting things for free.</font>

680
00:47:06,268 --> 00:47:10,261
<font color="yellow">But I'm someone who feels stifled
if I'm offered free gum.</font>

681
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,652
<font color="yellow">But I do have to get what is mine
in order to feel better.</font>

682
00:47:12,652 --> 00:47:15,277
<font color="yellow">You owe me bra money
for what I bought you back then.</font>

683
00:47:15,848 --> 00:47:18,810
<font color="yellow">"Bra-mon" what?</font>

684
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,487
<font color="yellow">Why are you trying to get it for free?</font>

685
00:47:20,487 --> 00:47:24,253
<font color="yellow">- I bought it for you.
- Let's go, okay? Come on.</font>

686
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,748
<font color="yellow">You should've been
like this to begin with.</font>

687
00:47:26,748 --> 00:47:27,960
<font color="yellow">You're so stubborn.</font>

688
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,011
<font color="yellow">Tell me where you're headed.</font>

689
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:31,295
<font color="yellow">You're dead.</font>

690
00:48:12,246 --> 00:48:14,400
<font color="yellow">Which of your two moms
are you going to live with?</font>

691
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:21,406
<font color="yellow">You didn't kiss me so why
did you tell the adults that you did?</font>

692
00:48:21,406 --> 00:48:23,418
<font color="yellow">Then, we can do it now.</font>

693
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:25,699
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

694
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:27,813
<font color="yellow">Are you going keep being confusing?</font>

695
00:48:29,257 --> 00:48:31,717
<font color="yellow">I've never been confused about anything.</font>

696
00:48:35,578 --> 00:48:38,101
<font color="yellow">I'm going to live with the mom
that is more jealous.</font>

697
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:42,761
<font color="yellow">The more jealous a person is,
the more she loves me.</font>

698
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:46,652
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

699
00:48:57,853 --> 00:48:59,125
<font color="yellow">How much?</font>

700
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:00,931
<font color="yellow">45,000 won.</font>

701
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:02,516
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

702
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:06,734
<font color="yellow">- This is 50,000 won.
- The 5,000 won is for buying it.</font>

703
00:49:08,063 --> 00:49:09,235
<font color="yellow">Reporter.</font>

704
00:49:09,734 --> 00:49:13,344
<font color="yellow">You told me to buy two
so that you could switch.</font>

705
00:49:13,926 --> 00:49:15,060
<font color="yellow">Two.</font>

706
00:49:17,793 --> 00:49:19,315
<font color="yellow">Here, here.</font>

707
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:22,978
<font color="yellow">- I'll give you change.
- 10,000 won is for buying it.</font>

708
00:49:22,978 --> 00:49:25,451
<font color="yellow">I told you I don't like free things.</font>

709
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:27,328
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm thankful for before.</font>

710
00:49:27,328 --> 00:49:29,748
<font color="yellow">What is this "bra-mon" thing anyway?</font>

711
00:49:29,748 --> 00:49:32,668
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin, I will buy you lots later.</font>

712
00:49:38,029 --> 00:49:40,527
<font color="yellow">That sounds great, Reporter.</font>

713
00:49:45,897 --> 00:49:47,728
<font color="yellow">Are the calculations done now?</font>

714
00:49:50,976 --> 00:49:52,447
<font color="yellow">Done now?</font>

715
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,808
<font color="yellow">- Done.
- Done.</font>

716
00:49:54,808 --> 00:49:57,382
<font color="yellow">This is it. You and I are done.</font>

717
00:50:05,574 --> 00:50:09,833
<font color="yellow">Because you two said I played you both,
I was very hurt at the funeral.</font>

718
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:12,770
<font color="yellow">To make it worse,
you said my pasta was disgusting.</font>

719
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,264
<font color="yellow">I was extremely hurt.</font>

720
00:50:15,264 --> 00:50:18,199
<font color="yellow">So, I have prepared this. Please eat.</font>

721
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,377
<font color="yellow">Taste it properly.</font>

722
00:50:20,377 --> 00:50:22,942
<font color="yellow">Determine if I played around with you
with disgusting pasta</font>

723
00:50:22,942 --> 00:50:26,210
<font color="yellow">or if I played around with you
with good pasta.</font>

724
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:31,342
<font color="yellow">Also, I would like to apologize for
not telling you that I knew Red well.</font>

725
00:50:36,505 --> 00:50:41,572
<font color="yellow">As for hitting you...
I am sorry about that.</font>

726
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:45,127
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay where you got hit?
- Yes.</font>

727
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:47,449
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

728
00:51:20,281 --> 00:51:22,138
<font color="yellow">Red is like my niece.</font>

729
00:51:22,138 --> 00:51:25,440
<font color="yellow">Red insisted that she no longer had
a mom and Joong Shin was very ill.</font>

730
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,357
<font color="yellow">I had a lot to think about.</font>

731
00:51:27,357 --> 00:51:30,978
<font color="yellow">I had to do it without Red finding out,
so I ended up having to lie.</font>

732
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,677
<font color="yellow">It is very important to me
what kind of a mom Red has, as well.</font>

733
00:51:38,018 --> 00:51:39,368
<font color="yellow">It is very good.</font>

734
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:42,257
<font color="yellow">You're very good.</font>

735
00:51:45,196 --> 00:51:48,103
<font color="yellow">I mean... it's very good.</font>

736
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:52,214
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Red grew up lonely.</font>

737
00:51:52,214 --> 00:51:54,335
<font color="yellow">She should be with a good mom now
and be happy.</font>

738
00:51:55,094 --> 00:51:57,578
<font color="yellow">That's what I wanted to discuss...</font>

739
00:52:04,011 --> 00:52:06,581
<font color="yellow">Is today's weather in studio or outside?</font>

740
00:52:08,009 --> 00:52:12,219
<font color="yellow">The first two are on the roof and
the second two are in the newsroom.</font>

741
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:13,982
<font color="yellow">You do it four times?</font>

742
00:52:13,982 --> 00:52:15,951
<font color="yellow">The early morning news is like that.</font>

743
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,168
<font color="yellow">Your stomach will pop out. Stop eating.</font>

744
00:52:24,168 --> 00:52:26,728
<font color="yellow">What stomach? Keep eating.</font>

745
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:29,074
<font color="yellow">- Eat this.
- It's a problem when you're sideways.</font>

746
00:52:29,074 --> 00:52:32,322
<font color="yellow">When you eat before a broadcast,
it looks bad if your stomach sticks out.</font>

747
00:52:32,322 --> 00:52:34,051
<font color="yellow">You can eat after the news.</font>

748
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:35,572
<font color="yellow">Who eats this much before?</font>

749
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:38,382
<font color="yellow">We can't leave this food behind.
It's expensive.</font>

750
00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:42,172
<font color="yellow">You were trying to eat everything before.</font>

751
00:52:45,793 --> 00:52:49,061
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee, have you even
bought me a bowl of ramen?</font>

752
00:52:49,061 --> 00:52:51,464
<font color="yellow">I paid for the tom yum in Thailand.</font>

753
00:52:51,464 --> 00:52:53,891
<font color="yellow">You did that for your friend, not me.</font>

754
00:52:53,891 --> 00:52:57,232
<font color="yellow">You don't let up even once
and argue back every time.</font>

755
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,978
<font color="yellow">Red grew up lonely.</font>

756
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:07,978
<font color="yellow">She should be with a good mom now
and be happy.</font>

757
00:53:08,951 --> 00:53:10,741
<font color="yellow">That's what I wanted to discuss...</font>

758
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:19,683
<font color="yellow">I just want to hear Red
call me "Mom" just once.</font>

759
00:53:19,683 --> 00:53:21,891
<font color="yellow">She calls me Mom.</font>

760
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:23,786
<font color="yellow">Isn't it your wish to become
the 9:00 p.m. anchor?</font>

761
00:53:23,786 --> 00:53:26,132
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I want to be
the 9:00 p.m. anchor?</font>

762
00:53:26,132 --> 00:53:29,971
<font color="yellow">Though I gave birth to her,
Bang Ja Young raised her.</font>

763
00:53:30,442 --> 00:53:32,324
<font color="yellow">Now, her father is in heaven.</font>

764
00:53:32,324 --> 00:53:36,446
<font color="yellow">Now, we have a chance to determine
who the real mom is.</font>

765
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,822
<font color="yellow">If I lose to Bang Ja Young,
I won't be able to breathe.</font>

766
00:53:39,822 --> 00:53:42,911
<font color="yellow">She can lose to me because
I'm her biological mother.</font>

767
00:53:42,911 --> 00:53:44,440
<font color="yellow">For me, it makes no sense.</font>

768
00:53:45,154 --> 00:53:48,319
<font color="yellow">I will be dying every second
and minute of jealousy.</font>

769
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,304
<font color="yellow">Jealously will rip up my insides.</font>

770
00:53:51,304 --> 00:53:54,449
<font color="yellow">I will be engulfed and
wrapped up in jealousy.</font>

771
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:56,049
<font color="yellow">I don't need anyone else.</font>

772
00:53:56,049 --> 00:53:58,996
<font color="yellow">I only want recognition from Red.</font>

773
00:53:58,996 --> 00:54:02,654
<font color="yellow">While others cooked for her
and did laundry</font>

774
00:54:02,654 --> 00:54:07,315
<font color="yellow">your mom clenched her jaw, fought
with men, and is sitting in the top seat.</font>

775
00:54:07,315 --> 00:54:08,833
<font color="yellow">I want to show her that.</font>

776
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:13,114
<font color="yellow">Then she will call me Mom.</font>

777
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:16,815
<font color="yellow">Isn't that the right thing?</font>

778
00:54:37,806 --> 00:54:39,141
<font color="yellow">I think it's too big.</font>

779
00:54:50,661 --> 00:54:53,139
<font color="yellow"><i>About your friend...</i></font>

780
00:54:53,139 --> 00:54:54,208
<font color="yellow"><i>Jung Won?</i></font>

781
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,545
<font color="yellow"><i>Is he a player?</i></font>

782
00:54:55,996 --> 00:54:57,777
<font color="yellow">Does he have a girlfriend?</font>

783
00:55:00,627 --> 00:55:02,288
<font color="yellow">I've become curious about him.</font>

784
00:55:09,286 --> 00:55:10,875
<font color="yellow">You two suit each other well.</font>

785
00:55:14,295 --> 00:55:15,697
<font color="yellow">You should date.</font>

786
00:55:15,697 --> 00:55:16,931
<font color="yellow">Can we?</font>

787
00:55:19,087 --> 00:55:20,630
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me?</font>

788
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:22,505
<font color="yellow">You and I have similar taste in girls.</font>

789
00:55:22,775 --> 00:55:23,819
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

790
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:25,433
<font color="yellow">I have better taste than you.</font>

791
00:55:25,433 --> 00:55:26,868
<font color="yellow">You have weird taste.</font>

792
00:55:26,868 --> 00:55:30,799
<font color="yellow">But wasn't there someone you liked?</font>

793
00:55:33,848 --> 00:55:35,007
<font color="yellow">Was there?</font>

794
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:41,485
<font color="yellow">The stew is boiling.</font>

795
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:55,864
<font color="yellow">How does it taste?</font>

796
00:55:56,531 --> 00:55:58,348
<font color="yellow">The taste isn't quite right yet.</font>

797
00:55:58,348 --> 00:55:59,828
<font color="yellow">Not right yet?</font>

798
00:55:59,828 --> 00:56:02,377
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be really good
if we cook it a little longer.</font>

799
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,619
<font color="yellow">You should date him, Pyo Na Ri.
This guy is really great.</font>

800
00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:09,132
<font color="yellow">You said you don't mind being dumped.</font>

801
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:12,268
<font color="yellow">You just want to meet a great guy and
have a passionate relationship.</font>

802
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:16,290
<font color="yellow">- Are you saying I'll get dumped?
- Yeah.</font>

803
00:56:16,663 --> 00:56:18,551
<font color="yellow">- By a great guy?
- Yeah.</font>

804
00:56:19,717 --> 00:56:22,107
<font color="yellow">He's too honest.</font>

805
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:25,328
<font color="yellow">Am I the great guy?</font>

806
00:56:25,328 --> 00:56:27,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're the great guy
who would dump her.</font>

807
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,339
<font color="yellow">What is this?
Are you telling us to date or not?</font>

808
00:56:30,339 --> 00:56:31,907
<font color="yellow">You should give it a try.</font>

809
00:56:33,386 --> 00:56:35,308
<font color="yellow">Don't get hurt this time.</font>

810
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:44,685
<font color="yellow">Jung Won is a better guy than me.</font>

811
00:57:06,397 --> 00:57:08,683
<font color="yellow">Oh! Reporter Lee.</font>

812
00:57:08,683 --> 00:57:11,014
<font color="yellow">Reporter Park, funny seeing you here.</font>

813
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:12,630
<font color="yellow">- Do you have a cigarette?
- Cigarette?</font>

814
00:57:13,844 --> 00:57:17,174
<font color="yellow">I thought you quit smoking.</font>

815
00:57:18,317 --> 00:57:20,177
<font color="yellow">- Did I?
- Gosh...</font>

816
00:57:20,177 --> 00:57:21,540
<font color="yellow">Return the favor.</font>

817
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:23,451
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

818
00:57:36,931 --> 00:57:38,373
<font color="yellow">Don't laugh.</font>

819
00:57:40,844 --> 00:57:42,862
<font color="yellow">I said don't laugh.</font>

820
00:57:56,614 --> 00:57:59,665
