<font color="yellow">Let's get married.</font>

3
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:15,944
<font color="yellow">And bring me that kimchi if you have it.</font>

4
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:23,216
<font color="yellow">You can take two ramens
out of the thousand.</font>

5
00:00:23,216 --> 00:00:25,762
<font color="yellow">I will cook you ramen a thousand times.</font>

6
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:27,538
<font color="yellow">This is a proposal.</font>

7
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:33,601
<font color="yellow">It is a proposal.</font>

8
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:37,431
<font color="yellow">Marry me.</font>

9
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:58,295
<font color="yellow">You asked me to marry you and
asked for kimchi at the same time?</font>

10
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:03,176
<font color="yellow">Can I just do one of the two?</font>

11
00:01:03,176 --> 00:01:04,432
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

12
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:09,590
<font color="yellow">I'll bring you the kimchi.</font>

13
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:27,703
<font color="yellow">Here. Eat lots.</font>

14
00:01:33,565 --> 00:01:35,015
<font color="yellow">That's kimchi.</font>

16
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,063
<font color="yellow">Was that a rejection?</font>

17
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:49,975
<font color="yellow">Did Reporter Lee just say it because
he felt bad when I got angry at him?</font>

18
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:52,003
<font color="yellow">He's acting weird.</font>

19
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:56,124
<font color="yellow">Is she saying no or what?</font>

20
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:04,921
<font color="yellow">I just don't know.</font>

21
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,239
<font color="yellow">Now, let's move on to today's weather.</font>

22
00:03:25,076 --> 00:03:28,447
<font color="yellow">With the late fall,
the morning temperature has dropped.</font>

23
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:32,125
<font color="yellow">The density of the fine
dust particles is at a good level</font>

24
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,576
<font color="yellow">just as it was yesterday.</font>

25
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:37,440
<font color="yellow">It will continue to be at a good level
through the weekend.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>That's kimchi.</i></font>

29
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:19,250
<font color="yellow">I'm doing an announcers
photo shoot up on the roof.</font>

30
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,294
<font color="yellow">Did I say anything?</font>

31
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:26,859
<font color="yellow">Oh no.</font>

32
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:29,971
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee, can you fix this for me?</font>

33
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:31,053
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

34
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:33,368
<font color="yellow">- My glove is caught in this.
- No.</font>

35
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:35,717
<font color="yellow">Should I be like this in the photo?</font>

36
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:37,556
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

37
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:45,382
<font color="yellow">Are you busy later?</font>

38
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:47,976
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

39
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:52,520
<font color="yellow">Then, I made some new kimchi,
so come by later to pick it up.</font>

40
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,774
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

41
00:05:01,774 --> 00:05:04,296
<font color="yellow">You could have done a better job.</font>

42
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,709
<font color="yellow">That wasn't your first time
with Hong Hye Won, right?</font>

43
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:14,962
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, really!
- The director's office wasn't the first.</font>

44
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:17,104
<font color="yellow">- Nothing happened.
- Then what was it?</font>

45
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:18,135
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

46
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:20,705
<font color="yellow">You always say you don't know
when you're put on the spot.</font>

47
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:22,226
<font color="yellow">- It was nothing.
- Why was it nothing?</font>

48
00:05:22,226 --> 00:05:23,241
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

49
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:25,464
<font color="yellow">You're trying to talk your way out of it
because it was something.</font>

50
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:27,721
<font color="yellow">- Stop arguing.
- You're making me argue.</font>

51
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,443
<font color="yellow">I'm saying that you don't need to worry.</font>

52
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:34,527
<font color="yellow">I told you that you're an expert
and genius at making a girl worry.</font>

53
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:38,717
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

54
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:42,565
<font color="yellow">If you're going to argue,
let's just shut our mouths and go.</font>

55
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:47,236
<font color="yellow">You don't date the same woman
for more than three months.</font>

56
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,758
<font color="yellow">Get off.</font>

57
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,793
<font color="yellow">That's a very short expiry date.
Three months.</font>

58
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:57,195
<font color="yellow">Let's just stop.</font>

59
00:05:58,127 --> 00:05:59,407
<font color="yellow">It's not true, right?</font>

60
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:00,464
<font color="yellow">Just stop! Stop!</font>

61
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:02,693
<font color="yellow">You'll date me for more
than three months, won't you?</font>

62
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:03,731
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

63
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,368
<font color="yellow">- Did you press the roof?
- Yes, Chief.</font>

64
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:49,145
<font color="yellow">Hey! Didn't the magazine
ask for announcers only?</font>

65
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:50,846
<font color="yellow">Are only announcers brides?</font>

66
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:53,796
<font color="yellow">They actually called me first.
What are you saying?</font>

67
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:55,233
<font color="yellow">Get on the next one.</font>

68
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,262
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

69
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:58,325
<font color="yellow">Get on the next one.
Can't you see this one is full?</font>

70
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:01,454
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- How many brides is this?</font>

71
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,854
<font color="yellow">Five brides?
Do I have to get married five times?</font>

72
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:06,455
<font color="yellow">Crazy punk.</font>

73
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:10,291
<font color="yellow">Who would marry you?
Don't get ahead of yourself.</font>

74
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,716
<font color="yellow">I'll go with this one.</font>

75
00:07:21,478 --> 00:07:24,092
<font color="yellow">How about dinner after the meeting?</font>

76
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:25,325
<font color="yellow">Let's not do that.</font>

77
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:27,493
<font color="yellow">I don't want to appear like we're trying
to use money to win them over.</font>

78
00:07:27,493 --> 00:07:31,834
<font color="yellow">Okay. Also, these are dresses that
were sponsored for the photo shoot.</font>

79
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,433
<font color="yellow">These are the stills.</font>

80
00:07:58,092 --> 00:07:59,582
<font color="yellow">You must not want to take it off.</font>

81
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,267
<font color="yellow">You should do the 9 p.m. news in it
and go home in it, too.</font>

82
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:06,168
<font color="yellow">They want us to do a group shot,
so I'm just waiting down here.</font>

83
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:08,683
<font color="yellow">I don't know why they didn't
do a group shot to begin with.</font>

84
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:10,476
<font color="yellow">I was looking everywhere for this.</font>

85
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:11,786
<font color="yellow">It is pretty.</font>

86
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:13,767
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri?</font>

87
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,258
<font color="yellow">No, I'm talking about you.</font>

88
00:08:19,284 --> 00:08:22,885
<font color="yellow">You fired her yourself
after part one of a live program.</font>

89
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,152
<font color="yellow">Who would date you, Brother-in-law?</font>

90
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:28,856
<font color="yellow">You said you liked her,
but then fired her yourself.</font>

91
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:30,359
<font color="yellow">How would she trust you and date you?</font>

92
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:33,703
<font color="yellow">You got dumped, right?</font>

93
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:36,964
<font color="yellow">I asked her to marry me.</font>

94
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:39,412
<font color="yellow">Maybe that's the reason why,
but she hasn't answered me yet.</font>

95
00:08:40,682 --> 00:08:43,873
<font color="yellow">I haven't brought it up again because
I'm scared she'll completely reject me.</font>

96
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:44,934
<font color="yellow">She hasn't answered you?</font>

97
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:47,192
<font color="yellow">Should I ask again?</font>

98
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,162
<font color="yellow">- You want to get married?
- Yes.</font>

99
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,335
<font color="yellow">That's something new.</font>

100
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:54,897
<font color="yellow">I don't want to lose her
like I lost my brother.</font>

101
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:58,418
<font color="yellow">Though I know I'm a cold person
when it comes to work.</font>

102
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:17,674
<font color="yellow">Let's go together.</font>

103
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:40,550
<font color="yellow">- Pyo Na Ri!
- Yes.</font>

104
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,421
<font color="yellow">- Come in.
- Okay.</font>

105
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:46,708
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

106
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,806
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

107
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:49,036
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

108
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:52,989
<font color="yellow">You're on the news, right?</font>

109
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:10,012
<font color="yellow">Did you two fight?</font>

110
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:11,121
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- No.</font>

111
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:14,180
<font color="yellow">Today is your last day of radiation.</font>

112
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,691
<font color="yellow">So, how do you feel?</font>

113
00:10:16,691 --> 00:10:17,780
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

114
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:23,642
<font color="yellow">If you had come regularly,
you would've been done ages ago.</font>

115
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:26,541
<font color="yellow">- However...
- That's what I'm saying.</font>

116
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:31,460
<font color="yellow">At first, you didn't listen to me at all
and upset me all the time.</font>

117
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,123
<font color="yellow">Still, you did everything I told you.
So, you're a good patient.</font>

118
00:10:36,123 --> 00:10:38,556
<font color="yellow">You did well, Grandma.</font>

119
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:43,108
<font color="yellow">Then, am I done now?</font>

120
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:46,209
<font color="yellow">We will need to check on
your leukocyte count.</font>

121
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:51,585
<font color="yellow">You just need to do some blood work
to check platelet levels and for anemia.</font>

122
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:56,686
<font color="yellow">Since it's your last time,
you should get an overall physical.</font>

123
00:10:56,686 --> 00:10:59,176
<font color="yellow">I'll add some extra tests.</font>

124
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:01,174
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- This and this.</font>

125
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,854
<font color="yellow">- Please make sure to check all of these.
- Yes.</font>

126
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:08,261
<font color="yellow">Good job getting through
the radiation, Grandma.</font>

127
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:11,432
<font color="yellow">No, Reporter Lee.</font>

128
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:33,694
<font color="yellow">I'm finally done with this awful thing.</font>

129
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,267
<font color="yellow">Are you happy?</font>

130
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:38,394
<font color="yellow">I'm excited.</font>

131
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,205
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm excited.</font>

132
00:11:41,747 --> 00:11:44,405
<font color="yellow">In a few months, I can take baths
and scrub my body all I want.</font>

133
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:45,522
<font color="yellow">I can drink, too.</font>

134
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:46,746
<font color="yellow">It's not like you weren't.</font>

135
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:51,411
<font color="yellow">I can exercise, swim, and dance.</font>

136
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:57,546
<font color="yellow">You suffered a lot, Reporter Lee.</font>

137
00:12:10,286 --> 00:12:11,628
<font color="yellow">Are you crying?</font>

138
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,247
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

139
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:17,729
<font color="yellow">You won't ever relapse and
you'll live a long, long time, right?</font>

140
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:18,830
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

141
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,474
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I just have tears.</font>

142
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:24,134
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why would you cry?</font>

143
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:27,785
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

144
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:32,800
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

145
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:35,422
<font color="yellow">The tears just keep coming.</font>

146
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:41,860
<font color="yellow">You cried when you first heard
I needed surgery for breast cancer too.</font>

147
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:43,574
<font color="yellow">Stop crying.</font>

148
00:12:43,574 --> 00:12:44,777
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

149
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:48,160
<font color="yellow">I'll have a good night too.</font>

150
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:12,595
<font color="yellow">Look at me, Na Ri.</font>

151
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,857
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

152
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,228
<font color="yellow">Stop frowning.</font>

153
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:40,945
<font color="yellow">One, two, three, and four.</font>

154
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,812
<font color="yellow">- Good, good.
- Oh yeah! That's great.</font>

155
00:13:42,812 --> 00:13:45,310
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's it! One, two, three, four!</font>

156
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:11,992
<font color="yellow">Voice phishing?</font>

157
00:14:11,992 --> 00:14:13,926
<font color="yellow">You? That was you?</font>

158
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:16,972
<font color="yellow">I just hated you all so much back then.</font>

159
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:20,881
<font color="yellow">I called both of you and Uncle,
but only Uncle got fooled.</font>

160
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:23,960
<font color="yellow">This is the 10 million won
that he sent.</font>

161
00:14:27,003 --> 00:14:28,830
<font color="yellow">Who did you do it with?</font>

162
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:33,155
<font color="yellow">I... I did it by myself.</font>

163
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:35,065
<font color="yellow">Seriously, you!</font>

164
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:39,746
<font color="yellow">It was a male voice,
so how could you have done it alone?</font>

165
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:43,384
<font color="yellow">Stop lying! Stop lying and tell us now.</font>

166
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:46,104
<font color="yellow">Tell us! Where did you
learn such bad things?</font>

167
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:54,489
<font color="yellow">Do it properly!</font>

168
00:14:56,778 --> 00:14:59,059
<font color="yellow">Let Red go, Chef.</font>

169
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,742
<font color="yellow">It was us who did it.</font>

170
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:02,513
<font color="yellow">You say you care about Red!</font>

171
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:05,864
<font color="yellow">You don't try to stop her.
Instead, you help her out?</font>

172
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,382
<font color="yellow">Don't go easy on them, Chef.
Is there a stick?</font>

173
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:10,396
<font color="yellow">You little punks.
I'll beat your behinds with it.</font>

174
00:15:10,396 --> 00:15:12,998
<font color="yellow">You guys aren't students.
You're criminals.</font>

175
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:14,823
<font color="yellow">If we report you, you'll become convicts.</font>

176
00:15:14,823 --> 00:15:17,989
<font color="yellow">Voice phishing, Criminal Law Act 347.</font>

177
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:21,282
<font color="yellow">In the occurrence of fraud
where there is monetary gain</font>

178
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:24,503
<font color="yellow">there is a maximum of 10 years in prison
and a maximum fine of 20 million won.</font>

179
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:28,661
<font color="yellow">Even if you are first time offender,
you get a minimum of one year in prison.</font>

180
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:31,584
<font color="yellow">You foolish high school kids.
Are you crazy?</font>

181
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:37,036
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault. It's my fault.</font>

182
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,417
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

183
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:42,214
<font color="yellow">I was wrong.</font>

184
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:46,052
<font color="yellow">Yes, Detective Park.</font>

185
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:50,192
<font color="yellow">How many recent voice phishing
cases do you have?</font>

186
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:53,331
<font color="yellow">What are the jobs of the victims?</font>

187
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:57,724
<font color="yellow">None of them are reporters, right?</font>

188
00:15:59,152 --> 00:16:00,973
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course there aren't.</font>

189
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:04,440
<font color="yellow">I was asking because I know one
who was a victim in college.</font>

190
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:06,543
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

191
00:16:07,652 --> 00:16:09,099
<font color="yellow">Goodness...</font>

192
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,999
<font color="yellow">So? Did he report it?</font>

193
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:15,204
<font color="yellow">No. Thank goodness.</font>

194
00:16:15,204 --> 00:16:18,248
<font color="yellow">It would be a bigger issue if he had.</font>

195
00:16:18,248 --> 00:16:19,341
<font color="yellow">What a relief.</font>

196
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:23,574
<font color="yellow">Lee Hwa Shin was probably
too embarrassed to even report it.</font>

197
00:16:24,185 --> 00:16:28,123
<font color="yellow">How could a reporter go to the police
about being a victim of voice phishing?</font>

198
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:29,334
<font color="yellow">Especially a current news reporter.</font>

199
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:32,657
<font color="yellow">He could change his mind
and report it even tomorrow.</font>

200
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:46,665
<font color="yellow">Jung Won.</font>

201
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:48,972
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll go to your place.
See me for a moment.</i></font>

202
00:16:51,296 --> 00:16:53,427
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to you, so okay.</font>

203
00:17:14,182 --> 00:17:15,371
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

204
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,981
<font color="yellow">Thank you for that day.</font>

205
00:17:18,434 --> 00:17:22,274
<font color="yellow">I only ended up suffering
by walking home by myself.</font>

206
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,929
<font color="yellow">You can lean on me
if you're having a hard time.</font>

207
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,607
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee proposed to me.</font>

208
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:30,480
<font color="yellow">He wants to marry me.</font>

209
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:35,645
<font color="yellow">So, what happened?</font>

210
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:40,421
<font color="yellow">If Reporter Lee asks me
properly once more</font>

211
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:43,154
<font color="yellow">I will say yes to him.</font>

212
00:17:43,154 --> 00:17:46,527
<font color="yellow">So, it really is over now.</font>

213
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:49,680
<font color="yellow">President. Date other women, okay?</font>

214
00:17:51,726 --> 00:17:53,021
<font color="yellow">That can't be.</font>

215
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:57,065
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin is someone who insisted
that he never had thoughts of marriage.</font>

216
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:02,477
<font color="yellow">Even when we were in college,
he spent the money he earned on himself.</font>

217
00:18:02,477 --> 00:18:05,406
<font color="yellow">He has never dated a girl
for more than three months.</font>

218
00:18:05,406 --> 00:18:08,918
<font color="yellow">He said he found the responsibilities of
having his own family burdensome.</font>

219
00:18:08,918 --> 00:18:12,447
<font color="yellow">He didn't want to get married.
That isn't Lee Hwa Shin.</font>

220
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:14,200
<font color="yellow">You punk...</font>

221
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:18,077
<font color="yellow">Did you ask Pyo Na Ri to marry you?</font>

222
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:19,965
<font color="yellow">I did. Why?</font>

223
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,336
<font color="yellow">Do you mean it?</font>

224
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:22,669
<font color="yellow">Of course I mean it.</font>

225
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,136
<font color="yellow">Be honest. You never wanted marriage.</font>

226
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:29,539
<font color="yellow">With all your heart and mind,
you've been against marriage.</font>

227
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:31,258
<font color="yellow">You hated it.</font>

228
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:32,514
<font color="yellow">You should go in without me.</font>

229
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:33,671
<font color="yellow">Are you two going to fight again?</font>

230
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:34,673
<font color="yellow">- No.
- No.</font>

231
00:18:34,673 --> 00:18:37,269
<font color="yellow">You'd better not fight, okay?</font>

232
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,294
<font color="yellow">You'd better not fight again!</font>

233
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:49,680
<font color="yellow">You know what? Just fight.
You two just go on and fight.</font>

234
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:55,103
<font color="yellow">I'll just be that girl who broke up
two longtime friends forever.</font>

235
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,804
<font color="yellow">I was being greedy and hoped that
you two were getting along better.</font>

236
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,373
<font color="yellow">I barely managed to try
and have some peace.</font>

237
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:03,869
<font color="yellow">Don't marry Hwa Shin.</font>

238
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:05,508
<font color="yellow">What? Who are you to say that?</font>

239
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:08,411
<font color="yellow">He doesn't mean what he's saying.</font>

240
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:10,020
<font color="yellow">That's a great friendship you have there.</font>

241
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,754
<font color="yellow">Stay out of it.</font>

242
00:19:11,754 --> 00:19:15,053
<font color="yellow">Okay, you two should fight, then.
Go on and fight.</font>

243
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,177
<font color="yellow">Marry me.</font>

244
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:17,408
<font color="yellow">Why would she marry you?</font>

245
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:19,992
<font color="yellow">You'll suffer all your life
if you marry him.</font>

246
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,324
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- He's the type to even cheat on you.</font>

247
00:19:22,324 --> 00:19:25,818
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- He won't do any housework.</font>

248
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:27,927
<font color="yellow">I can help out too when I want.</font>

249
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:29,626
<font color="yellow">He's so crazy about his work.</font>

250
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,152
<font color="yellow">His love will grow cold so fast.</font>

251
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:36,584
<font color="yellow">Men are all the same.
You're not much different.</font>

252
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:39,950
<font color="yellow">You say you're going to love her
passionately forever? You?</font>

253
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,167
<font color="yellow">You're away on business trips
for over half the year.</font>

254
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:46,943
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I told you that I wanted to
take her around with me on the plane.</font>

255
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:49,102
<font color="yellow">Don't you think Pyo Na Ri
has work she wants to do?</font>

256
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:53,017
<font color="yellow">You want her to ride around next to you
and give up all her work?</font>

257
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:56,010
<font color="yellow">You want her to be like your secretary
and take care of you?</font>

258
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,807
<font color="yellow">Then get a secretary!</font>

259
00:19:57,807 --> 00:20:00,327
<font color="yellow">Don't pretend it's about marriage.</font>

260
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:02,588
<font color="yellow">I know you're not
the type to get married.</font>

261
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:05,671
<font color="yellow">I was going to wait a little longer</font>

262
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,460
<font color="yellow">and stand on the
sidelines a little longer.</font>

263
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:13,384
<font color="yellow">But you go around playing
with her heart in this way.</font>

264
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:16,069
<font color="yellow">Then you won't take responsibility
for it until the end.</font>

265
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:19,377
<font color="yellow">Please! Stop fighting, would you?</font>

266
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:23,712
<font color="yellow">All right, I admit it.</font>

267
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:29,113
<font color="yellow">Up to now, I never met anyone
who made me want to get married.</font>

268
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:32,018
<font color="yellow">No one made me fear getting
broken up with, and that's why.</font>

269
00:20:32,018 --> 00:20:33,704
<font color="yellow">Can't a person change his mind?</font>

270
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:36,306
<font color="yellow">Can't my heart change?</font>

271
00:20:36,306 --> 00:20:38,718
<font color="yellow">You're doing this because
I'm still here, not giving up.</font>

272
00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:42,354
<font color="yellow">Didn't you spit out the proposal
because I made you anxious?</font>

273
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:45,534
<font color="yellow">From what I know about you,
you're more than capable of that.</font>

274
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:49,373
<font color="yellow">You're more understanding, Jung Won.
Please stop, okay?</font>

275
00:20:52,113 --> 00:20:54,728
<font color="yellow">Or you can hold it in,
even if you're petty, Reporter Lee.</font>

276
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:57,038
<font color="yellow">Hey... hey.</font>

277
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:01,384
<font color="yellow">I want kids, too.</font>

278
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:04,715
<font color="yellow">I want a wife, too.</font>

279
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,156
<font color="yellow">I must have learned it from you.</font>

280
00:21:08,156 --> 00:21:10,729
<font color="yellow">Every time you, my friend, dated a girl</font>

281
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,967
<font color="yellow">you used to seriously consider marriage</font>

282
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,796
<font color="yellow">and I found that frustrating,
but now I'm like that, too.</font>

283
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:20,739
<font color="yellow">I used to think that peeing in Han River
wouldn't change it from being Han River.</font>

284
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,036
<font color="yellow">But I must have learned from you.</font>

285
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:25,515
<font color="yellow">I must have changed, too.</font>

286
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:29,671
<font color="yellow">I don't know what marriage
or burdens are yet.</font>

287
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:32,881
<font color="yellow">I don't quite know what
responsibilities are yet.</font>

288
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:35,121
<font color="yellow">I really do not want to be
apart from this woman.</font>

289
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:37,399
<font color="yellow">With that in mind,
I asked her to marry me.</font>

290
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:38,600
<font color="yellow">Can't I do that?</font>

291
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,286
<font color="yellow">Is that something I'm
never allowed to say? Huh?</font>

292
00:21:48,404 --> 00:21:50,776
<font color="yellow">Am I more petty than Jung Won?</font>

293
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,085
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

294
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:20,046
<font color="yellow">Sis, I'm sorry. I know I was wrong.</font>

295
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,258
<font color="yellow">What did you do?</font>

296
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:23,826
<font color="yellow">- You don't know?
- What?</font>

297
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:27,215
<font color="yellow">I'm just sorry for everything I've done.</font>

298
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,638
<font color="yellow">My kind little brother.</font>

299
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,545
<font color="yellow">No, Chi Yeol.</font>

300
00:22:30,545 --> 00:22:36,126
<font color="yellow">Out of all the men I know in this world,
you're the one without any flaws.</font>

301
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:40,125
<font color="yellow">You are the only without any negatives
or anything wrong with you.</font>

302
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:44,927
<font color="yellow">If only I had met you as a man,
I could love you, my Chi Yeol.</font>

303
00:22:44,927 --> 00:22:48,537
<font color="yellow">Then I wouldn't have to date two guys
or any of this nonsense.</font>

304
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:50,818
<font color="yellow">Chi Yeol, aren't there any guys like you?</font>

305
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:53,934
<font color="yellow">No, it's because you don't know me.</font>

306
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:56,751
<font color="yellow">What is it?
Were you second place this time?</font>

307
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,045
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- What?</font>

308
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:01,364
<font color="yellow">Hey! How long are you going to
keep meeting Jung Won?</font>

309
00:23:01,364 --> 00:23:04,245
<font color="yellow">Are you going to see him
every time he asks you to meet?</font>

310
00:23:04,245 --> 00:23:06,524
<font color="yellow">Don't pick up even if he calls.</font>

311
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:08,805
<font color="yellow">Just delete his number from your phone.</font>

312
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,083
<font color="yellow">- Let's go inside.
- Who are you to say that?</font>

313
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,307
<font color="yellow">What's it to you who my sister meets
or whose calls she picks up?</font>

314
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:17,275
<font color="yellow">Why would you yell at her
in the middle of the night?</font>

315
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:19,639
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Hold on, okay?</font>

316
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:22,380
<font color="yellow">Are you looking down on my sister?</font>

317
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:27,679
<font color="yellow">I pretended not to know
and didn't say anything.</font>

318
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:31,837
<font color="yellow">You're that reporter my sister liked
for over three years, aren't you?</font>

319
00:23:34,088 --> 00:23:39,450
<font color="yellow">I wanted to go beat up the guy
who didn't like my sister back.</font>

320
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,046
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much I held myself back?</font>

321
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:42,719
<font color="yellow">Keep going. Keep going.</font>

322
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,509
<font color="yellow">How could you not like my sister?</font>

323
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:50,228
<font color="yellow">Keep going. Go on.</font>

324
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,403
<font color="yellow">Are you blind?</font>

325
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:56,134
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay.
I must've been blind back then.</font>

326
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,307
<font color="yellow">I admit it.</font>

327
00:23:57,307 --> 00:23:58,987
<font color="yellow">I'm normal now.</font>

328
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:01,917
<font color="yellow">I like your sister.
I can't like her, right?</font>

329
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,372
<font color="yellow">Without my permission...</font>

330
00:24:07,372 --> 00:24:11,296
<font color="yellow">you cannot date, marry,
or do anything with my sister.</font>

331
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:17,106
<font color="yellow">From what I heard from Chef,
Go Jung Won sounds like a better guy.</font>

332
00:24:17,106 --> 00:24:18,767
<font color="yellow">You should date him.</font>

333
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:20,809
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

334
00:24:21,663 --> 00:24:22,930
<font color="yellow">My number one ranked brother.</font>

335
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:23,959
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

336
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:34,187
<font color="yellow">I'm... a good person too.</font>

337
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:46,712
<font color="yellow">Have you had breakfast?</font>

338
00:24:46,712 --> 00:24:48,587
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I have.
- Not you.</font>

339
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,947
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Should I buy you some?</font>

340
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:56,242
<font color="yellow">Do you need money?
I can lend you some if you need.</font>

341
00:24:58,578 --> 00:25:01,010
<font color="yellow">- How much?
- About 10 million won.</font>

342
00:25:11,506 --> 00:25:12,855
<font color="yellow">Oh, sorry.</font>

343
00:25:12,855 --> 00:25:16,088
<font color="yellow">I was held up by the president again.
He's making me crazy.</font>

344
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:18,228
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you start it?</font>

345
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:20,564
<font color="yellow">I'm not the director so that
I can avoid running meetings.</font>

346
00:25:20,564 --> 00:25:22,392
<font color="yellow">You sure are a petty man.</font>

347
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:25,447
<font color="yellow">Before we start,
I saw on the morning news</font>

348
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:27,469
<font color="yellow">that the fine dust
particle level was good.</font>

349
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:28,807
<font color="yellow">That's completely wrong.</font>

350
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:31,181
<font color="yellow">Take a look outside. It's hazy out there.</font>

351
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:35,255
<font color="yellow">Since we're on the topic,
I think we should do a story on it.</font>

352
00:25:35,255 --> 00:25:37,229
<font color="yellow">Me. I'll do it, Director.</font>

353
00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:42,405
<font color="yellow">We've done so many stories on it,
so reporters don't want to do it.</font>

354
00:25:42,405 --> 00:25:44,251
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm saying I'll do it.</font>

355
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,107
<font color="yellow">I'll go out to film on scene.</font>

356
00:25:47,107 --> 00:25:48,668
<font color="yellow">I'm the expert on weather.</font>

357
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:50,566
<font color="yellow">I've done fine dust particles
so many times</font>

358
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:53,090
<font color="yellow">and I know about the
dangers of it very well.</font>

359
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:55,158
<font color="yellow">Anyone else want to do it?</font>

360
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:58,736
<font color="yellow">No, there isn't.</font>

361
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:02,567
<font color="yellow">Make sure you have all of the equipment.</font>

362
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:07,297
<font color="yellow">So, do you have a good story?</font>

363
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:09,376
<font color="yellow">The location will give us one.</font>

364
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,298
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's go.</font>

365
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:18,905
<font color="yellow">We are in the city streets of Seoul where
many citizens and children enjoy the sun.</font>

366
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:22,885
<font color="yellow">The level of fine dust particles
announced today was 30 micrograms.</font>

367
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:24,418
<font color="yellow">This is a good level.</font>

368
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:28,231
<font color="yellow">However, the true level of
fine dust particles is...</font>

369
00:26:30,516 --> 00:26:32,564
<font color="yellow">85 micrograms.</font>

370
00:26:32,564 --> 00:26:34,293
<font color="yellow">That is a bad level.</font>

371
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:39,117
<font color="yellow">60 percent of monitoring stations
for fine dust particles are on rooftops.</font>

372
00:26:39,117 --> 00:26:41,854
<font color="yellow">Also, they are inside parks.</font>

373
00:26:41,854 --> 00:26:46,555
<font color="yellow">Why don't we see what the level
would be at the height of a child?</font>

374
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:58,104
<font color="yellow">My face is approximately at
the height of a five-year-old child.</font>

375
00:26:58,104 --> 00:27:00,421
<font color="yellow">At this height, the level is...</font>

376
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:03,411
<font color="yellow">120 micrograms.</font>

377
00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:06,709
<font color="yellow">It has gone up 35 from before.</font>

378
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,673
<font color="yellow">Now, I am at the height
of a three or four year old.</font>

379
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:18,529
<font color="yellow">At this height, the level of
fine dust particles is...</font>

380
00:27:20,864 --> 00:27:23,643
<font color="yellow">150 micrograms.</font>

381
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:26,004
<font color="yellow">That would be considered very bad.</font>

382
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:31,065
<font color="yellow">It is because dust built up on
a surface does not move very well.</font>

383
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:34,443
<font color="yellow">High levels of fine dust particles
at 150 micrograms</font>

384
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:38,533
<font color="yellow">are flying around and entering the
bodies of children ages three or four.</font>

385
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:41,883
<font color="yellow">You're done, right?
Should we do a closing</font>

386
00:27:41,883 --> 00:27:43,442
<font color="yellow">No, wait! Hold on, Director.</font>

387
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:45,643
<font color="yellow">- I'll keep going like this.
- What?</font>

388
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,457
<font color="yellow">In the case that a three year old
takes in fine dust particles for an hour</font>

389
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:57,154
<font color="yellow">I will see what can occur by putting
myself through the same levels.</font>

390
00:27:57,154 --> 00:27:58,475
<font color="yellow">Director, put on a mask.</font>

391
00:27:58,475 --> 00:28:00,113
<font color="yellow">Hey! Bring me a mask!</font>

392
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,389
<font color="yellow">- You sure you don't want one?
- No, I'm fine.</font>

393
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:10,844
<font color="yellow">It's been 40 minutes.
Are you really going to go an hour?</font>

394
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:13,853
<font color="yellow">Kids usually walk for an hour
when they go outside.</font>

395
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:15,931
<font color="yellow">Kids are breathing in the air.</font>

396
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:17,711
<font color="yellow">We should know for sure.</font>

397
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:22,304
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Doctor.</font>

398
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:24,344
<font color="yellow">Yes. What is it?</font>

399
00:28:24,344 --> 00:28:28,504
<font color="yellow">The results for Lee Hwa Shin came out.</font>

400
00:28:31,064 --> 00:28:32,554
<font color="yellow">Is there a problem?</font>

401
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,255
<font color="yellow">You should open it up.</font>

402
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,836
<font color="yellow">Peek-a-boo.</font>

403
00:28:51,837 --> 00:28:54,090
<font color="yellow">Peek-a-boo. Peek...</font>

404
00:28:55,613 --> 00:28:58,325
<font color="yellow">Beom is far too old for peek-a-boo.</font>

405
00:28:59,294 --> 00:29:01,763
<font color="yellow">He graduated from that ages ago.</font>

406
00:29:01,763 --> 00:29:03,043
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

407
00:29:04,153 --> 00:29:07,211
<font color="yellow">I guess you ought to get married soon.</font>

408
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:15,740
<font color="yellow">Beom, do you want something to eat?</font>

409
00:29:34,453 --> 00:29:35,527
<font color="yellow">Ma'am.</font>

410
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:40,981
<font color="yellow">- Me?
- Yes, you there.</font>

411
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:43,484
<font color="yellow">Buy us two red bean breads
if you have time.</font>

412
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:44,797
<font color="yellow">Why would I do that?</font>

413
00:29:44,797 --> 00:29:46,544
<font color="yellow">Why is he eating ice cream in this cold?</font>

414
00:29:46,544 --> 00:29:49,314
<font color="yellow">Hey! He'll catch a cold.</font>

415
00:29:49,314 --> 00:29:51,337
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Oh no.</font>

416
00:29:51,337 --> 00:29:52,787
<font color="yellow">Beom. Oh dear.</font>

417
00:29:52,787 --> 00:29:54,054
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- I'm sorry.</font>

418
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:56,917
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'm sorry. It's okay.</font>

419
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:59,468
<font color="yellow">- Get up now.
- Stop eating this cold thing.</font>

420
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:04,961
<font color="yellow">Don't eat this. You stop
eating it too, Reporter Lee.</font>

421
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:16,952
<font color="yellow">You must be full from eating
all those fine dust particles.</font>

422
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,538
<font color="yellow">Are you sick?</font>

423
00:30:22,514 --> 00:30:25,024
<font color="yellow">Oh, I feel like I'm going to die.</font>

424
00:30:25,903 --> 00:30:27,463
<font color="yellow">You're just overreacting.</font>

425
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:32,288
<font color="yellow">Seriously, my whole body
doesn't even feel like it's mine.</font>

426
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:40,787
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

427
00:30:40,787 --> 00:30:42,661
<font color="yellow">You said your body isn't like your own.</font>

428
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:44,842
<font color="yellow">Let me try holding another woman.</font>

429
00:30:52,524 --> 00:30:55,295
<font color="yellow">We're in our neighborhood, Reporter Lee.</font>

430
00:31:01,636 --> 00:31:04,889
<font color="yellow">Are you cold, Beom? Beom is cold.</font>

431
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:07,712
<font color="yellow">That's because you had
ice cream so late at night.</font>

432
00:31:16,784 --> 00:31:17,963
<font color="yellow">I'm cold, too.</font>

433
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,635
<font color="yellow">You, too?</font>

434
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:22,086
<font color="yellow">Why do you only adore Beom?</font>

435
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:24,843
<font color="yellow">There is no living being
prettier than you.</font>

436
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,238
<font color="yellow">Weren't you someone
who only states facts?</font>

437
00:31:29,238 --> 00:31:30,572
<font color="yellow">It is a fact.</font>

438
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:36,636
<font color="yellow">You can believe me or not.</font>

439
00:31:38,712 --> 00:31:41,052
<font color="yellow">Let me try hugging another girl.
Don't get jealous.</font>

440
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:48,921
<font color="yellow">- Na Ri.
- What?</font>

441
00:31:48,921 --> 00:31:50,238
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

442
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,331
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee.</font>

443
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,459
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

444
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,857
<font color="yellow">Don't you have something
you want to say to me?</font>

445
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:09,840
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

446
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:13,197
<font color="yellow">Something you should say properly.</font>

447
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:22,558
<font color="yellow">- Say properly?
- Yes.</font>

448
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:26,586
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Oh, there isn't?</font>

449
00:32:26,586 --> 00:32:28,342
<font color="yellow">Okay, never mind.</font>

450
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:29,473
<font color="yellow">Wow!</font>

451
00:32:31,287 --> 00:32:32,684
<font color="yellow">It's snowing.</font>

452
00:32:33,645 --> 00:32:34,669
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

453
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:36,481
<font color="yellow">It's really snowing?</font>

454
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:39,758
<font color="yellow">- Wow!
- Wow, really?</font>

455
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:46,227
<font color="yellow">- Beom, what is this?
- Snow.</font>

456
00:32:48,469 --> 00:32:50,634
<font color="yellow">It's the first snow. First snow.</font>

457
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,656
<font color="yellow">We should definitely return
the money and apologize to him.</font>

458
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:02,946
<font color="yellow">No, you can't!</font>

459
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:04,665
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

460
00:33:04,665 --> 00:33:07,665
<font color="yellow">Chef, you don't know his personality.</font>

461
00:33:07,665 --> 00:33:10,332
<font color="yellow">He could put his own niece in prison.</font>

462
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:12,019
<font color="yellow">Then what do you suggest?</font>

463
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:14,062
<font color="yellow">We should put it back secretly.</font>

464
00:33:14,062 --> 00:33:17,287
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?
We should hold on to it for now.</font>

465
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:20,717
<font color="yellow">We need to put it back so that we have
something to say if we get caught later.</font>

466
00:33:20,717 --> 00:33:23,850
<font color="yellow">Our daughter did voice phishing
and the moms held on to the money?</font>

467
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:25,639
<font color="yellow">Did I say we should keep it forever?</font>

468
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:27,680
<font color="yellow">It's just obvious we'll get caught
if we return it.</font>

469
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,298
<font color="yellow">He'll start digging into who did it.</font>

470
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:32,466
<font color="yellow">Let the kids take the
college entrance exam first.</font>

471
00:33:32,466 --> 00:33:34,254
<font color="yellow">You are both abnormal.</font>

472
00:33:34,254 --> 00:33:37,930
<font color="yellow">You have to tell him the truth
and return it to him directly.</font>

473
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,697
<font color="yellow">- You can't do that!
- You can't do that!</font>

474
00:33:41,081 --> 00:33:45,373
<font color="yellow">When Lee Hwa Shin isn't around,
let's go put it there secretly.</font>

475
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,823
<font color="yellow">We should return it later.</font>

476
00:33:47,823 --> 00:33:51,135
<font color="yellow">He'll be too embarrassed
to report it, anyway.</font>

477
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:53,430
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you we should
go to him directly.</font>

478
00:33:58,938 --> 00:34:02,555
<font color="yellow">Then... let's do this.</font>

479
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:10,317
<font color="yellow">Hey! You have to be held
responsible if you get caught!</font>

480
00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:12,971
<font color="yellow">Chef, go stop her. What are you doing?</font>

481
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:19,372
<font color="yellow">It's snowing.</font>

482
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:25,504
<font color="yellow">Wow. It's the first snow already.</font>

483
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,906
<font color="yellow"><i>Reporter Lee proposed to me.</i></font>

484
00:34:39,906 --> 00:34:41,326
<font color="yellow"><i>He wants to marry me.</i></font>

485
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:44,627
<font color="yellow">So, it really is over now.</font>

486
00:34:44,627 --> 00:34:45,926
<font color="yellow">I want kids.</font>

487
00:34:45,926 --> 00:34:48,437
<font color="yellow">I want a wife, too.</font>

488
00:34:54,908 --> 00:34:57,399
<font color="yellow">It's the first snow. Why are you alone?</font>

489
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:08,321
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

490
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:09,772
<font color="yellow">Here, it's cold.</font>

491
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:16,038
<font color="yellow">The first snow came early this year.</font>

492
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:18,292
<font color="yellow">Did it?</font>

493
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:19,725
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

494
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:22,152
<font color="yellow">It wasn't in the forecast, but it came.</font>

495
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:24,386
<font color="yellow">- What a waste.
- What is?</font>

496
00:35:24,386 --> 00:35:30,013
<font color="yellow">The most exciting weather forecast
to do was the first snow.</font>

497
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:35,149
<font color="yellow">If it snowed before a weather forecaster
could even give the forecast</font>

498
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:37,602
<font color="yellow">I would feel strangely upset,
like it was such a waste.</font>

499
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:43,169
<font color="yellow">It's like you lost your chance
to give some exciting news.</font>

500
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:46,350
<font color="yellow">It's the first snow.</font>

501
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:51,482
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Lee.
- Huh?</font>

502
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:53,781
<font color="yellow">The first snow is falling.</font>

503
00:35:54,564 --> 00:35:55,723
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

504
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:58,176
<font color="yellow">It's the first snow and we're together.</font>

505
00:35:58,176 --> 00:35:59,303
<font color="yellow">Yes...</font>

506
00:35:59,328 --> 00:36:02,102
<font color="yellow">It's my first time being with
my boyfriend during a first snow.</font>

507
00:36:02,102 --> 00:36:04,198
<font color="yellow">- For real.
- So?</font>

508
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:07,234
<font color="yellow">Is there something you want to say?</font>

509
00:36:09,988 --> 00:36:11,576
<font color="yellow">It's the perfect time now.</font>

510
00:36:12,426 --> 00:36:14,915
<font color="yellow">This is the perfect time.</font>

511
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:19,035
<font color="yellow">Here, take this.</font>

512
00:36:19,035 --> 00:36:20,837
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- Pork belly.</font>

513
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:24,605
<font color="yellow">You took in a lot of fine dust particles.
You should go home and eat this.</font>

514
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:29,105
<font color="yellow">All right, I'll grill it for you.</font>

515
00:36:30,872 --> 00:36:33,868
<font color="yellow">- Pork belly...
- We can have it with that kimchi.</font>

516
00:36:40,618 --> 00:36:42,475
<font color="yellow">Should I make you a snowman?</font>

517
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:46,248
<font color="yellow">Have you seen enough snow from
a first snow to make a snowman?</font>

518
00:36:46,248 --> 00:36:49,538
<font color="yellow">I can make a small one, then. Hold on.</font>

519
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:08,761
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

520
00:37:21,154 --> 00:37:24,975
<font color="yellow">Live with me like these two here.</font>

521
00:37:31,328 --> 00:37:33,890
<font color="yellow">What is that? Don't they have
eyes, noses, or mouths?</font>

522
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:36,571
<font color="yellow">Live with me.</font>

523
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,633
<font color="yellow">Are you finished making it or
are you in the middle of making it?</font>

524
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,705
<font color="yellow">Do you not want to?</font>

525
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:47,198
<font color="yellow">We can make it together.</font>

526
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:54,109
<font color="yellow">Eyes, nose, mouth... all of it.</font>

527
00:37:55,661 --> 00:37:57,379
<font color="yellow">Everything, together.</font>

528
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,747
<font color="yellow">We can have two kids, too.</font>

529
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:11,953
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

530
00:38:25,223 --> 00:38:26,506
<font color="yellow">Hey...</font>

531
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,930
<font color="yellow">Sit down here. Okay?</font>

532
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,149
<font color="yellow">Like this?</font>

533
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:49,297
<font color="yellow">Like this.</font>

534
00:39:18,848 --> 00:39:20,718
<font color="yellow">You really live in this house, right?</font>

535
00:39:20,718 --> 00:39:22,379
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

536
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:23,902
<font color="yellow">I'm trusting you, Chef.</font>

537
00:39:23,902 --> 00:39:25,259
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

538
00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:27,008
<font color="yellow">- Get going.
- Bye.</font>

539
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:36,013
<font color="yellow">I really don't know if
this is the right thing to do.</font>

540
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:43,212
<font color="yellow">I told Chef to stop her.</font>

541
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:45,448
<font color="yellow">Why is he doing that with her? Why?</font>

542
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:50,165
<font color="yellow">Oh, the snow is so pretty.</font>

543
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:57,935
<font color="yellow">This is too small.</font>

544
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,716
<font color="yellow">Pick up. Pick up, Bang Ja Young.</font>

545
00:40:06,716 --> 00:40:09,116
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- Hwa Shin is here.</font>

546
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,526
<font color="yellow">Get out now. Get out.</font>

547
00:40:18,913 --> 00:40:19,913
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin, Hwa Shin!</font>

548
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,859
<font color="yellow">Our shoes!</font>

549
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,767
<font color="yellow">Hurry, hurry.</font>

550
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:11,922
<font color="yellow">It can't be...</font>

551
00:42:12,354 --> 00:42:15,915
<font color="yellow"><i>It's morning. Wake up!</i></font>

552
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,460
<font color="yellow"><i>It's morning. Wake up!</i></font>

553
00:42:41,442 --> 00:42:42,815
<font color="yellow">Chief Bang.</font>

554
00:42:43,558 --> 00:42:46,109
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chef.</font>

555
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:29,895
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

556
00:43:32,562 --> 00:43:33,794
<font color="yellow">Put them on.</font>

557
00:43:38,263 --> 00:43:39,495
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

558
00:43:45,529 --> 00:43:46,984
<font color="yellow">- Be careful.
- Okay.</font>

559
00:43:58,439 --> 00:43:59,562
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

560
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:02,223
<font color="yellow">What else? Let's date.</font>

561

and below is very different.</i></font>

563

<font color="yellow"><i>Even once I stood up,
I felt a foreign substance in my throat.</i></font>

564
00:44:27,393 --> 00:44:29,575
<font color="yellow"><i>I had a prolonged dry cough.</i></font>

565
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:32,093
<font color="yellow">Not bad.</font>

566

<font color="yellow">She worked hard on it.</font>

571
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,765
<font color="yellow">She sacrificed herself
to make it provocative.</font>

575
00:45:03,638 --> 00:45:05,354
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

576
00:45:05,354 --> 00:45:09,384
<font color="yellow">That wasn't the line.
Why did she close in such a scary way?</font>

577
00:45:09,384 --> 00:45:13,493
<font color="yellow">She went out herself and suffered.
I guess she felt the line was boring.</font>

578
00:45:18,596 --> 00:45:22,998
<font color="yellow">Seeing her do a news story,
I remember when she was a forecaster.</font>

579

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

583
00:45:38,393 --> 00:45:39,544
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

584
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,930
<font color="yellow">I think you should come alone today.</font>

585
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:44,951
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

586
00:45:47,924 --> 00:45:49,928
<font color="yellow"><i>Just... because.</i></font>

587
00:45:49,928 --> 00:45:54,359
<font color="yellow">Don't come with Pyo Na Ri today.</font>

588
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:57,500
<font color="yellow">Come alone today, Reporter Lee.</font>

589
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,960
<font color="yellow">I don't want to, Doctor.</font>

590
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,772
<font color="yellow">You always told me to come with her.
Why are you telling me to come alone?</font>

591
00:46:04,772 --> 00:46:08,732
<font color="yellow">Do you have a bad result for me?</font>

592
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:13,285
<font color="yellow">Is there a problem?</font>

593
00:46:16,825 --> 00:46:18,444
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you answering me?</font>

594
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:21,325
<font color="yellow">I'll be there with Pyo Na Ri.</font>

595
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:24,305
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go alone.</font>

596
00:46:24,305 --> 00:46:26,526
<font color="yellow">I'll be going with her today.</font>

597
00:47:01,872 --> 00:47:03,386
<font color="yellow">Yes, Hwa Shin.</font>

598
00:47:04,123 --> 00:47:06,283
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- <i>Yes, what?</i></font>

599
00:47:06,283 --> 00:47:08,658
<font color="yellow">Why is my heart racing so fast?</font>

600
00:47:08,658 --> 00:47:11,453
<font color="yellow">Did you drink too much coffee?</font>

601
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:12,488
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

602
00:47:13,158 --> 00:47:14,826
<font color="yellow">Why did you call?</font>

603
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,067
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing later?
- <i>Later?</i></font>

604
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,957
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be home.</font>

605
00:47:19,488 --> 00:47:22,899
<font color="yellow">Hey, when are you bringing
your girlfriend around?</font>

606
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:26,745
<font color="yellow"><i>Get married and give me some grandkids.</i></font>

607
00:47:26,745 --> 00:47:30,189
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's have dinner later.</font>

608
00:47:30,189 --> 00:47:31,989
<font color="yellow">I'll pick you up later.</font>

609
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:33,375
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

610
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:36,136
<font color="yellow">Wait. I have to go then.</font>

611
00:47:36,136 --> 00:47:37,620
<font color="yellow">I need to get ready.</font>

612
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:40,538
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the hair salon. I'm busy.</font>

613
00:47:40,538 --> 00:47:42,015
<font color="yellow">Bye, now.</font>

614
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:45,133
<font color="yellow">I don't have time to be doing this.</font>

615
00:48:01,366 --> 00:48:03,756
<font color="yellow">What did I do wrong?</font>

616
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:04,991
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

617
00:48:05,701 --> 00:48:07,370
<font color="yellow">You did this before.</font>

618
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,165
<font color="yellow">It was too amateurish, careless,
and seemed like a beginner did it.</font>

619
00:48:14,165 --> 00:48:16,540
<font color="yellow">It lacked logic and reasoning.</font>

620
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,350
<font color="yellow">It also lacked the details used
to appeal to people's emotions.</font>

621
00:48:19,848 --> 00:48:22,402
<font color="yellow">Also, your emotional closing
in the studio....</font>

622
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:25,654
<font color="yellow">It was obvious you were
trying to scare the viewers.</font>

623
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:29,783
<font color="yellow">According to your conclusion,
people shouldn't even breathe.</font>

624
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:31,562
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

625
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:34,140
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

626
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:38,435
<font color="yellow">I knew it would be harder
to get recognition from you</font>

627
00:48:38,435 --> 00:48:40,272
<font color="yellow">than to get a full-time position.</font>

628
00:48:40,808 --> 00:48:42,312
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Na Ri.</font>

629
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,125
<font color="yellow">Later, in the evening...</font>

630
00:48:45,725 --> 00:48:47,879
<font color="yellow">- After the hospital?
- Yes.</font>

631
00:48:49,504 --> 00:48:51,310
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner with my mom.</font>

632
00:48:58,721 --> 00:48:59,960
<font color="yellow">Already?</font>

633
00:49:01,328 --> 00:49:02,404
<font color="yellow">Are you scared?</font>

634
00:49:03,036 --> 00:49:04,142
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

635
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:05,864
<font color="yellow">I'm even more scared right now.</font>

636
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:10,694
<font color="yellow">Can't I meet her a little later?</font>

637
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:14,790
<font color="yellow">She thinks I'm Jung Won's
girlfriend, doesn't she?</font>

638
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,502
<font color="yellow">I'm worried you might change your mind.</font>

639
00:49:24,076 --> 00:49:25,413
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll meet her.</font>

640
00:49:26,248 --> 00:49:28,547
<font color="yellow">It's not like she'll kill me.</font>

641
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:30,859
<font color="yellow">I suppose I'll just die if she does.</font>

642
00:49:32,442 --> 00:49:34,569
<font color="yellow">I'll say I love you even if she kills me.</font>

643
00:49:35,701 --> 00:49:36,792
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

644
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:38,453
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

645
00:50:02,205 --> 00:50:04,814

647
00:50:11,078 --> 00:50:12,975
<font color="yellow">Show me your bride.</font>

648
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:16,006
<font color="yellow">You need to see her physiognomy, as well?</font>

649
00:50:16,567 --> 00:50:17,886
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

650
00:50:18,344 --> 00:50:19,596
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

651
00:50:24,073 --> 00:50:26,348
<font color="yellow">- Her?
- Oh, that scared me.</font>

652
00:50:27,172 --> 00:50:28,218
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

653
00:50:31,712 --> 00:50:34,343
<font color="yellow">She... she drinks well.</font>

655
00:50:36,564 --> 00:50:38,665
<font color="yellow">- You're lucky.
- She cries a lot, too.</font>

656
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,594
<font color="yellow">I haven't taught her
everything I know yet.</font>

657
00:50:45,614 --> 00:50:47,504
<font color="yellow">She's not that good at
taking care of herself.</font>

I'll just die.</font>

660
00:50:53,314 --> 00:50:55,096
<font color="yellow">she would just die.</font>

661
00:50:55,096 --> 00:50:57,225

00:50:57,225 --> 00:50:58,625

<font color="yellow">make one woman happy?</font>

665
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:15,886
<font color="yellow">I've become curious about my life
because of the woman I love.</font>

666
00:51:16,754 --> 00:51:18,306
<font color="yellow">By any chance...</font>

667
00:51:23,294 --> 00:51:24,634
<font color="yellow">am I going to die early?</font>

668
00:51:26,392 --> 00:51:27,683
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

669
00:51:29,234 --> 00:51:33,694
<font color="yellow">I want to live a long,
long time with this woman.</font>

670
00:51:49,178 --> 00:51:50,364
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

671
00:51:50,364 --> 00:51:54,451
<font color="yellow">Doctor Geum says she suddenly had to
go into surgery so I shouldn't come.</font>

672
00:51:55,732 --> 00:51:58,118
<font color="yellow">She told me not to worry
about the test results.</font>

673
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,294
<font color="yellow">Go wait at the restaurant.</font>

674
00:52:01,294 --> 00:52:02,433
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

675
00:52:37,806 --> 00:52:39,238
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee.</font>

676
00:52:40,707 --> 00:52:41,850
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

677
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:58,908
<font color="yellow">Has the cancer relapsed?</font>

678
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,185
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't be nervous.</i></font>

679
00:53:18,647 --> 00:53:20,105
<font color="yellow">Is it a relapse?</font>

680
00:53:22,143 --> 00:53:23,198
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

681
00:53:34,142 --> 00:53:37,988
<font color="yellow">Then why did you tell me to come alone?</font>

682
00:53:39,377 --> 00:53:40,852
<font color="yellow"><i>You're not alone.</i></font>

683
00:53:44,765 --> 00:53:48,873
<font color="yellow">Because you might want to
keep it a secret from Pyo Na Ri.</font>

684
00:53:48,873 --> 00:53:52,064
<font color="yellow">I don't want any secrets from Pyo Na Ri.
Please tell me now.</font>

685
00:53:56,508 --> 00:53:58,415
<font color="yellow"><i>You have me.</i></font>

686
00:54:03,002 --> 00:54:06,451
<font color="yellow">We will have to run
some more tests, but...</font>

687
00:54:09,752 --> 00:54:12,274
<font color="yellow">it looks highly probable
that you are sterile.</font>

688
00:54:19,604 --> 00:54:20,888
<font color="yellow"><i>I love you. </i></font>

689
00:54:35,654 --> 00:54:41,817
<font color="yellow">Your male hormone levels have
dropped a lot lower than normal levels.</font>

690
00:54:43,143 --> 00:54:44,397
<font color="yellow">It would be difficult.</font>

691
00:54:46,308 --> 00:54:48,049
<font color="yellow">Sterile, Doctor?</font>

692
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:52,404
<font color="yellow">You're saying... I can't have children?</font>

693
00:54:55,654 --> 00:54:58,725
<font color="yellow">That's why you told me
to come without Pyo Na Ri.</font>

694
00:55:07,484 --> 00:55:08,955
<font color="yellow">But why...</font>

695
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:12,524
<font color="yellow">Why? Why is it me?</font>

696
00:55:13,107 --> 00:55:14,803
<font color="yellow">It wasn't enough
that I got breast cancer.</font>

697
00:55:14,803 --> 00:55:16,004
<font color="yellow">Now I can't have kids.</font>

698
00:55:21,055 --> 00:55:22,522
<font color="yellow">Am I finished as a man?</font>

699
00:55:22,522 --> 00:55:25,198
<font color="yellow">Come on. Who said that?</font>

700
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:26,788
<font color="yellow">That makes me finished. Does it not?</font>

701
00:55:26,788 --> 00:55:28,687
<font color="yellow">That's why you told me
not to bring Pyo Na Ri.</font>

702
00:55:28,689 --> 00:55:31,035
<font color="yellow">Are you finished just because
you can't have a child?</font>

703
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:36,163
<font color="yellow">There are many couples who live
without children and love each other.</font>

704
00:55:36,163 --> 00:55:39,899
<font color="yellow">Live just loving each other?</font>

705
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,397
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

706
00:55:55,678 --> 00:55:57,279
<font color="yellow">I don't want to!</font>

707
00:55:58,214 --> 00:56:01,145
<font color="yellow">I don't want that for myself!</font>

708
00:56:02,133 --> 00:56:04,872
<font color="yellow">Other people can live like that.</font>

709
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:09,575
<font color="yellow">Why me? Why is this happening?</font>

710
00:56:10,183 --> 00:56:13,712
<font color="yellow">Was breast cancer not enough?</font>

711
00:56:14,332 --> 00:56:16,113
<font color="yellow">Breast cancer...</font>

712
00:56:16,113 --> 00:56:19,643
<font color="yellow">Why are the gods doing this to me
and not letting me have children?</font>

713
00:56:21,221 --> 00:56:23,352
<font color="yellow">How could this happen?</font>

714
00:56:23,352 --> 00:56:25,721
<font color="yellow">Why does this happen to me?</font>

715
00:56:27,203 --> 00:56:29,917
<font color="yellow">I was born a man
and I want to die a man.</font>

716
00:56:29,917 --> 00:56:31,343
<font color="yellow">So, why, why?</font>

717
00:56:31,343 --> 00:56:33,881
<font color="yellow">What did I do so wrong?</font>

718
00:56:35,031 --> 00:56:36,370
<font color="yellow">I want to get married.</font>

719
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:39,783
<font color="yellow">I want to be normal with two kids.</font>

720
00:56:39,783 --> 00:56:42,622
<font color="yellow">That's all I want in my life, so why?</font>

721
00:56:46,826 --> 00:56:50,748
<font color="yellow">Doctor, I'd rather jump into
Han River and die right now.</font>

722
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:52,627
<font color="yellow">That's how I feel right now.</font>

723
00:56:52,627 --> 00:56:53,946
<font color="yellow">Come on, now.</font>

724
00:56:53,946 --> 00:56:56,946
<font color="yellow">I had breast cancer and now I'm sterile.
Do you want to marry me, Doctor?</font>

725
00:57:00,114 --> 00:57:01,986
<font color="yellow">Nurse Oh, do you want to marry me?</font>

726
00:57:06,515 --> 00:57:10,236
<font color="yellow">You're telling me to live alone forever
and never get married.</font>

727
00:57:10,236 --> 00:57:11,714
<font color="yellow">That's what you're telling me.</font>

728
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:15,067
<font color="yellow">That's what this is, Doctor.</font>

729
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:21,479
<font color="yellow">Fix this somehow, would you?</font>

730
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,614
<font color="yellow">Do something and fix it.</font>

731
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:27,549
<font color="yellow">Please, fix it.</font>

732
00:57:29,841 --> 00:57:35,710
<font color="yellow">I'll live my life being careful not to
relapse and get breast cancer again.</font>

733
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:39,051
<font color="yellow">Just let me live like other men.</font>

734
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,464
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

735
00:57:42,868 --> 00:57:46,346
