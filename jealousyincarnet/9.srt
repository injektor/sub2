on Reporter Lee's face?</font>

18

I drank and called you?</font>

23
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:41,372

something to tell you.</font>

<font color="yellow">You know your friend
Reporter Lee Hwa Shin?</font>

26
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:54,172
<font color="yellow">I heard he's dating the
weather forecaster, Pyo Na Ri.</font>

27
00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:56,005
<font color="yellow">There's a rumor all over the station.</font>

28

<font color="yellow">How can Chef not even have
ramen in the house?</font>

30

<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

32
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:20,215
<font color="yellow">Oh, my child.</font>

33
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:11,098
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything to say?</font>

34
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:13,398
<font color="yellow">Are you going to pretend to sleep?</font>

35
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:27,711
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee Hwa Shin found at the scene
sleeping in the same bed as Pyo Na Ri.</font>

36
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:30,230
<font color="yellow">What is the situation?</font>

37
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:48,996
<font color="yellow">What is it that you're thinking?</font>

38
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:50,256
<font color="yellow">Do you like Pyo Na Ri?</font>

39
00:05:57,264 --> 00:06:00,273
<font color="yellow">I was taking Pyo Na Ri back because
she had all those drinks for me.</font>

40
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:02,691
<font color="yellow">She has a cold and she was shivering,
so I got a blanket for her.</font>

41
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,780
<font color="yellow">Then I got sleepy too,
so I fell asleep.</font>

42
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:07,694
<font color="yellow">This is what I think.</font>

43
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:10,624
<font color="yellow">If you were facing each other
or sleeping in each other's arms</font>

44
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:12,136
<font color="yellow">I would have just turned around and left.</font>

45
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:15,598
<font color="yellow">If two people like each other,
I don't like to get involved.</font>

46
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:16,879
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

47
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:26,624
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

48
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,713
<font color="yellow">It was like this.</font>

49
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:39,261
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri had her back to you.</font>

50
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:42,121
<font color="yellow">You were sleeping while facing her back.</font>

51
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:44,533
<font color="yellow">Also, on top of the blanket.</font>

52
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:47,978
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

53
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:51,771
<font color="yellow">You were holding her without her
knowing after she fell asleep.</font>

54
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:55,992
<font color="yellow">A drunk Pyo Na Ri,
who won't know a thing tomorrow.</font>

55
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,848
<font color="yellow">I suppose so.</font>

56
00:06:57,848 --> 00:07:01,090
<font color="yellow">She seemed to be doting on you all night.</font>

57
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,951
<font color="yellow">But Pyo Na Ri's eyes were like
those of a girl doing her homework.</font>

58
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,739
<font color="yellow">Women know what that looks like.</font>

59
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:10,405
<font color="yellow">Therefore, you like her by yourself.</font>

60
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:12,131
<font color="yellow">It's a one-sided love.</font>

61
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:15,408
<font color="yellow">Alone... and secretly.</font>

62
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:18,670
<font color="yellow">One-sided? Alone and secretly?</font>

63
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,715
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

64
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:24,410
<font color="yellow">You're saying I have a
one-sided love for Pyo Na Ri?</font>

65
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,523
<font color="yellow">That's ridiculous. That's nonsense.</font>

66
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:29,013
<font color="yellow">Are you talking or farting?</font>

67
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,112
<font color="yellow">It was a mistake.</font>

68
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:33,626
<font color="yellow">It was the alcohol.</font>

69
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:36,463
<font color="yellow">This won't happen again.</font>

70
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:37,800
<font color="yellow">It won't, right?</font>

71
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:40,624
<font color="yellow">It shouldn't.</font>

72
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,872
<font color="yellow">Also, would you cut your nails?</font>

73
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:46,032
<font color="yellow">You nearly poked my eyes out.
I nearly lost my sight.</font>

74
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,593
<font color="yellow">You and Pyo Na Ri don't suit one another.</font>

75
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:10,158
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you smell like alcohol.</font>

76
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:36,175
<font color="yellow">She won't be able to get up at 3 a.m.</font>

77
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:42,811
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

79
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,525
<font color="yellow">Have I gone crazy?</font>

80
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:54,990
<font color="yellow"><i>Therefore, you like her by yourself.</i></font>

81

82
00:08:57,724 --> 00:09:00,079

86
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:21,906

- You scared me.</font>

88
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,209

92
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:46,265
<font color="yellow">You can't let me off easy.</font>

kicked by you today.</font>

94
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,991
<font color="yellow">I need to take a beating

95
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:54,157
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- Why?</font>

96
00:09:55,617 --> 00:09:57,288
<font color="yellow">So that I can sober up quickly.</font>

97
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:59,348
<font color="yellow">We always used to
go boxing after drinking.</font>

98
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:03,262
<font color="yellow">Just hit me so that
I can really sober up.</font>

99
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:06,641

I've felt your punch, Jung Won.</font>

100
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:08,070
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't go easy on me either.</font>

101
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,285
<font color="yellow">Should we make a bet?</font>

102
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:25,035
<font color="yellow">- A bet?
- We always made a bet.</font>

103
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:26,928
<font color="yellow">You're going to win this game.</font>

104

<font color="yellow">I'm going to lose to you.</font>

105
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:31,921

106
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:33,176
<font color="yellow">What's the fun in that?</font>

107

108
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:40,647
<font color="yellow">It's not like we have an audience.
We don't need it to be fun.</font>

109
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:42,329
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

110
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,809
<font color="yellow">Fight back, okay?</font>

111
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,604
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you'll lose?
You'll lose if you do.</font>

112

<font color="yellow">You're going to lose?</font>

113
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:17,588
<font color="yellow">Do you feel sober now
that you've been hit?</font>

114
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:19,455

don't you?</font>

115
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:28,314

122
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:58,246

You want to go all out?</font>

because I'm a friend, right?</font>

127

<font color="yellow">You don't even need to
count to 10. I'm KO'ed.</font>

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,483
<font color="yellow">It was a newsroom department dinner.</font>

134

135
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,810

then go wake Pyo Na Ri up.</font>

<font color="yellow">- I'll wake her up.
- Huh?</font>

141
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:53,998
<font color="yellow">I'll wake her up. Oh...</font>

Pyo Na Ri's feet are?</font>

149
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:28,300
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's because she stands for work</font>

are calloused too.</font>

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,769
<font color="yellow">You've seen the bottoms of her feet?</font>

152
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,262
<font color="yellow">Her feet are cold.</font>

153
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,785
<font color="yellow">She doesn't have a car,
so she can't even sleep at home.</font>

154
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:40,319
<font color="yellow">She's always traveling around.</font>

155
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:42,232
<font color="yellow">I want to give her good shoes.</font>

156
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:47,555
<font color="yellow">Take a shower and get some sleep.</font>

157
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:49,455
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have to
stay up all night too.</font>

158
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,061
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about Pyo Na Ri.
I'll wake her up.</font>

159
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:56,969
<font color="yellow">There's a rumor that
you're dating Pyo Na Ri.</font>

160
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,200
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

161
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,001
<font color="yellow">How did a rumor like that start?</font>

162
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,659
<font color="yellow">It's wrong, right?</font>

163
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,209
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

164
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,824
<font color="yellow">Why isn't this thing coming off?</font>

165
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,829
<font color="yellow">I'll let her sleep for five more minutes.</font>

166
00:16:57,606 --> 00:16:59,021
<font color="yellow">Is she dreaming?</font>

167
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,642
<font color="yellow">"I like you."</font>

168
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:15,212
<font color="yellow">When will I hear that from you?</font>

169
00:18:00,686 --> 00:18:03,676
<font color="yellow">It's almost time. Let's get started.</font>

170
00:18:03,676 --> 00:18:06,172
<font color="yellow">Check the location of the cameras.</font>

171
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,091
<font color="yellow">Be careful of your hands.</font>

172
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:10,301
<font color="yellow">Tell Assistant Director Choi
to come down.</font>

173
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:13,031
<font color="yellow">Let's change the order of these.</font>

174
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:16,155
<font color="yellow">This one first and then this.</font>

175
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:20,022
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

176
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:22,500
<font color="yellow">I made this myself.</font>

177
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,192
<font color="yellow">This isn't a sponsored dress.</font>

178
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:26,374
<font color="yellow">It's from that day?</font>

179
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:27,815
<font color="yellow">My first present.</font>

180
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:30,288
<font color="yellow">President Go.</font>

181
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:33,022
<font color="yellow">Could I get sponsored by your
clothing company, as well?</font>

182
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:35,948
<font color="yellow">- Do a good job.
- Okay.</font>

183
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,994
<font color="yellow">He's Lee Hwa Shin's best friend, right?</font>

184
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:53,323
<font color="yellow">- Give it to me.
- What?</font>

185
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:55,060
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

186
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:59,797
<font color="yellow">But... this is mine.</font>

187
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,111
<font color="yellow">It's a dress that was sponsored
to be on the news.</font>

188
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:05,092
<font color="yellow">Didn't you just hear him?</font>

189
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:08,236
<font color="yellow">It's not a sponsored dress.</font>

190
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:09,736
<font color="yellow">It was given to me.</font>

191
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:11,988
<font color="yellow">Also, it was made specially for me.</font>

192
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:15,797
<font color="yellow">You're going to be on for five minutes.
I'm going to be on for two hours.</font>

193
00:19:15,797 --> 00:19:17,837
<font color="yellow">Can't you make a sacrifice?</font>

194
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:21,088
<font color="yellow">Hand it over while she's asking nicely.
She's asking you for it.</font>

195
00:19:21,088 --> 00:19:23,669
<font color="yellow">No, it's mine!
I will never give it to you.</font>

196
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:28,706
<font color="yellow">What... what?</font>

197
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:30,486
<font color="yellow">Help!</font>

198
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:47,769
<font color="yellow">Seriously, this woman!</font>

199
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:49,626
<font color="yellow">What was she thinking...</font>

200
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:54,557
<font color="yellow">Gosh, she reeks of alcohol.</font>

201
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,532
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

202
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:33,319
<font color="yellow">Oh no! Oh no!</font>

203
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:36,704
<font color="yellow">Oh, I must be crazy. I'm so sorry.</font>

204
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:38,597
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry. I'm crazy.</font>

205
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:41,896
<font color="yellow">I must be insane. I really am.
What am I going to do?</font>

206
00:20:41,896 --> 00:20:43,636
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

207
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:47,152
<font color="yellow">I'm just too old for all of this.</font>

208
00:20:47,152 --> 00:20:49,874
<font color="yellow">But I drank too much and
I ended up here. What do I do?</font>

209
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,261
<font color="yellow">Just kill me now or please save me, Chef.</font>

210
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:55,184
<font color="yellow">I'm just so sorry.</font>

211
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:57,903
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry. I don't know what to do.</font>

212
00:20:57,903 --> 00:20:59,092
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

213
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:05,386
<font color="yellow">It was just a mistake.</font>

214
00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:11,024
<font color="yellow">I will head down first.
Come down for breakfast.</font>

215
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:13,004
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

216
00:21:18,684 --> 00:21:20,762
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what do I do?</font>

217
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:38,594
<font color="yellow">It's not what you think.</font>

218
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:43,118
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

219
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:48,355
<font color="yellow">I'm going to run away if
you do this one more time.</font>

220
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:50,739
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It was my mistake.</font>

221
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:52,355
<font color="yellow">I feel like vomiting.</font>

222
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:55,003
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Red. It won't happen again.</font>

223
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:56,786
<font color="yellow">- Mom was wrong.
- Get out.</font>

224
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:59,159
<font color="yellow">- Get out.
- Red!</font>

225
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,273
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay. I'll get out.</font>

226
00:22:01,273 --> 00:22:03,531
<font color="yellow">All right, I said I'll get out.</font>

227
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,369
<font color="yellow">You're crazy. You're must be crazy.
Oh my goodness!</font>

228
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:18,598
<font color="yellow">Oh my!</font>

229
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:22,267
<font color="yellow">What do you want, Reporter Kye?</font>

230
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:26,003
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me you... already?</font>

231
00:22:27,728 --> 00:22:30,459
<font color="yellow">- You!
- Oh, I'm so hungry.</font>

232
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,750
<font color="yellow">Chef, were you that easy of a man?</font>

233
00:22:41,912 --> 00:22:44,394
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time since
the air has been this clean.</font>

234
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:46,995
<font color="yellow">The concentration of fine dust and smog</font>

235
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:49,135
<font color="yellow">is at normal to good
in the country today.</font>

236
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:53,037
<font color="yellow">There is no rain in the forecast,
so it will be perfect for dates...</font>

237
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:55,864
<font color="yellow">Good. Anchor, stand by.</font>

238
00:22:55,864 --> 00:22:59,416
<font color="yellow">Park Jin, why do you keep
pouting like that?</font>

239
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:01,566
<font color="yellow">Hey, Pyo Na Ri looks pretty today.</font>

240
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:04,167
<font color="yellow">Enjoy this clear fall day.
That was the weather.</font>

241
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,214
<font color="yellow">Cue.</font>

242
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:08,353
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri, thank you for the weather.</font>

243
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:12,117
<font color="yellow">The weather is bright and Pyo Na Ri,
you look very bright, as well.</font>

244
00:23:12,117 --> 00:23:15,390
<font color="yellow">It seems being in love
makes one beautiful.</font>

245
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:19,712
<font color="yellow">They say that intra-office dating
is the flower of dating.</font>

246
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:21,339
<font color="yellow">What's she talking about?</font>

247
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:22,970
<font color="yellow">I see the flower has bloomed.</font>

248
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:26,560
<font color="yellow">That was today's News Morning.</font>

249
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,126
<font color="yellow">I hope you have a day filled with love.</font>

250
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:31,847
<font color="yellow">- What is she saying?
- You didn't know, Director?</font>

251
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,907
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Thank you.</font>

252
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:53,151
<font color="yellow">It's good for your hangover.</font>

253
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:55,032
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Chef.</font>

254
00:23:57,654 --> 00:23:59,791
<font color="yellow">It's very delicious, Chef.</font>

255
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,501
<font color="yellow">Why is everything so salty?
I don't want to eat it.</font>

256
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:12,090
<font color="yellow">- What's with him, Uncle?
- It's nothing.</font>

257
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,320
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

258
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:16,630
<font color="yellow">The adults should
live an upstanding life.</font>

259
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,655
<font color="yellow">They are worse than us.</font>

260
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:28,012
<font color="yellow">What's up with Red, Uncle?</font>

261
00:24:28,012 --> 00:24:29,770
<font color="yellow">You kids don't need to know.</font>

262
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,315
<font color="yellow">Kids?</font>

263
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:33,759
<font color="yellow">There are no kids here.</font>

264
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,834
<font color="yellow">They should be busy studying and
they're busy kissing each other.</font>

265
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:41,040
<font color="yellow">It's a love triangle, at that.
They're very complicated, too.</font>

266
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,839
<font color="yellow">Why are you treating them
like little kids?</font>

267
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,463
<font color="yellow">You're all in a love triangle, right?</font>

268
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:45,610
<font color="yellow">Reporter Kye!</font>

269
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,710
<font color="yellow">Give me some stew too.</font>

270
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,124
<font color="yellow">I drank yesterday too.</font>

271
00:24:49,124 --> 00:24:51,665
<font color="yellow">I also need to get over my hangover.</font>

272
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:53,832
<font color="yellow">Yes, I was going to give you some.</font>

273
00:24:53,832 --> 00:24:58,161
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri lives up on the roof.
Doesn't your sister ever come home?</font>

274
00:24:58,161 --> 00:24:59,310
<font color="yellow">Is she sleeping elsewhere?</font>

275
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,392
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't trust your sister too much.</font>

276
00:25:01,392 --> 00:25:02,665
<font color="yellow">Why would you say such a thing?</font>

277
00:25:02,665 --> 00:25:06,980
<font color="yellow">They say your sister is dating someone.
It's Reporter Lee Hwa Shin, apparently.</font>

278
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,088
<font color="yellow">You didn't know, did you?</font>

279
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:11,180
<font color="yellow">You thought she wasn't coming home
because of her morning broadcasts, right?</font>

280
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,767
<font color="yellow">Your sister is pretty skilled
at other things.</font>

281
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:14,925
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

282
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:16,697
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee Hwa Shin? You mean that--</font>

283
00:25:16,697 --> 00:25:19,697
<font color="yellow">Come on! Can't you just shut your mouth?</font>

284
00:25:19,697 --> 00:25:21,155
<font color="yellow">We're all trying to eat.</font>

285
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:24,092
<font color="yellow">This is a place for family
to gather and eat happily.</font>

286
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:26,694
<font color="yellow">I know you must be a great person
at work with no one to answer to.</font>

287
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:30,115
<font color="yellow">No, you go around saying whatever
you please to the entire nation.</font>

288
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:32,846
<font color="yellow">You keep going on and on,
making people lose their appetite!</font>

289
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:34,123
<font color="yellow">Don't come down tomorrow.</font>

290
00:25:34,923 --> 00:25:37,501
<font color="yellow">I will not feed you, Reporter Kye. Okay?</font>

291
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:39,444
<font color="yellow">He's so cool.</font>

292
00:25:39,444 --> 00:25:42,592
<font color="yellow">You are not allowed in this kitchen
starting tomorrow.</font>

293
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:47,527
<font color="yellow">Okay, everyone stop. Let's talk.</font>

294
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:51,831
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

295
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:54,053
<font color="yellow">Park Jin, are you insane?</font>

296
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:58,415
<font color="yellow">Why would you bring up dating in
the office and talk about love on air?</font>

297
00:25:58,415 --> 00:26:00,233
<font color="yellow">Who cares about who's dating whom?</font>

298
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:02,378
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin, are you...</font>

299
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:04,882
<font color="yellow">Are you really...</font>

300
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:10,784
<font color="yellow">What is this all about?</font>

301
00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:14,002
<font color="yellow">Gosh, come on, Director!</font>

302
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:15,926
<font color="yellow">- It's not true.
- What isn't?</font>

303
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:20,310
<font color="yellow">You always said that the forecasters
were part of the news department.</font>

304
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,635
<font color="yellow">You said to take care of them.
That's all I've ever done.</font>

305
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:26,961
<font color="yellow">How could you think we would...
that is such nonsense.</font>

306
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,370
<font color="yellow">Why would people say these things?</font>

307
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,890
<font color="yellow">Hong Hye Won.</font>

308
00:26:30,402 --> 00:26:33,521
<font color="yellow">Would you please help me out?
Why are you all being like this?</font>

309
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:35,540
<font color="yellow">All these people are doubting me.</font>

310
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:41,288
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri, don't you feel wronged?
Why don't you speak up?</font>

311
00:26:43,255 --> 00:26:45,412
<font color="yellow">It's not true, everyone.</font>

312
00:26:45,412 --> 00:26:48,220
<font color="yellow">I don't like Reporter Lee.</font>

313
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,712
<font color="yellow">I really, really do not like him.</font>

314
00:26:50,712 --> 00:26:54,162
<font color="yellow">Director, I won't be dating at work.
That won't ever happen.</font>

315
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:57,127
<font color="yellow">That won't happen even in the future.
You don't need to worry.</font>

316
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:58,935
<font color="yellow">Wow, seriously.</font>

317
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:01,263
<font color="yellow">Let's not be this way
as a broadcast family.</font>

318
00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:11,915
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, you were really good
at lying back there.</font>

319
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:15,755
<font color="yellow">"I really don't like Reporter Lee.
I really don't, Director!"</font>

320
00:27:15,755 --> 00:27:18,126
<font color="yellow">"I really, really do not like him."</font>

321
00:27:19,235 --> 00:27:20,908
<font color="yellow">Announcer Park Jin.</font>

322
00:27:21,676 --> 00:27:23,816
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee's feelings must be hurt.</font>

323
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:27,465
<font color="yellow">Even if you had to put on
a show in front of everyone.</font>

324
00:27:27,465 --> 00:27:29,278
<font color="yellow">- Na Joo Hee.
- Na Ri.</font>

325
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:31,230
<font color="yellow">You got this dress
by dating Reporter Lee.</font>

326
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,606
<font color="yellow">Didn't you get it from his friend
by flattering him?</font>

327
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:37,380
<font color="yellow">Flattering him?</font>

328
00:27:39,476 --> 00:27:40,568
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, you!</i></font>

329
00:27:42,174 --> 00:27:44,114
<font color="yellow"><i>You just won't stop, will you?</i></font>

330
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:48,226
<font color="yellow">If you're an announcer,
you should act like one.</font>

331
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:50,342
<font color="yellow">You should report only the truth.</font>

332
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:54,851
<font color="yellow">How could you tell a complete lie to the
entire nation first thing in the morning?</font>

333
00:27:54,851 --> 00:27:55,943
<font color="yellow">And you.</font>

334
00:27:56,846 --> 00:28:00,711
<font color="yellow">Do you have to get involved in this
and try to instigate a fight?</font>

335
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,936
<font color="yellow">You thought I didn't know
because I didn't bring it up?</font>

336
00:28:02,936 --> 00:28:06,206
<font color="yellow">You purposely spilled that sauce on me
so that I'd have to wear a belly t-shirt.</font>

337
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:07,817
<font color="yellow">Then I got fired.</font>

338
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:10,697
<font color="yellow">Then you refused to leave
my weather slot as if it were yours.</font>

339
00:28:10,697 --> 00:28:12,703
<font color="yellow">You caused a broadcast accident.</font>

340
00:28:12,703 --> 00:28:14,810
<font color="yellow">That was mine! It was mine!</font>

341
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:18,211
<font color="yellow">What did you say before?
I was flattering men to get this dress?</font>

342
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:21,071
<font color="yellow">Me? I did that?</font>

343
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:25,742
<font color="yellow">You're about as loyal as the electric tax</font>

344
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:27,863
<font color="yellow">that fluctuates
between summer and winter.</font>

345
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:29,354
<font color="yellow">You wench!</font>

346
00:28:29,561 --> 00:28:31,242
<font color="yellow"><i>Have you seen the impossible happen?</i></font>

347
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:34,127
<font color="yellow"><i>Why would you start a rumor
that I'm dating Reporter Lee?</i></font>

348
00:28:34,127 --> 00:28:36,070
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to die?
- It's true, though.</font>

349
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,311
<font color="yellow">Hey! It's true?</font>

350
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:40,320
<font color="yellow">I can only breathe
because I have two nostrils.</font>

351
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,476
<font color="yellow">If not, I would have died due
to suffocation by now because of you.</font>

352
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:44,692
<font color="yellow">Seriously, you...</font>

353
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:47,476
<font color="yellow">Na Ri, you're the only pretending
to be so innocent.</font>

354
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,636
<font color="yellow">Then you go around playing men.</font>

355
00:28:50,636 --> 00:28:54,735
<font color="yellow">You should have taken it off.
I wouldn't have gone so far then.</font>

356
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:57,676
<font color="yellow">Let go! Do you know
what kind of dress this is?</font>

357
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:01,323
<font color="yellow">We're really not dating!</font>

358
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,672
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

359
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:04,463
<font color="yellow">Just move it!</font>

360
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,098
<font color="yellow">It's not true! I don't like Reporter Lee.</font>

361
00:29:12,973 --> 00:29:15,133
<font color="yellow">He really isn't that great!</font>

362
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:18,909
<font color="yellow">Am I crazy? Why would I like him?</font>

363
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:21,873
<font color="yellow">I'm sick and tired of him,
just sick and tired!</font>

364
00:29:21,873 --> 00:29:24,953
<font color="yellow">If I ever end up dating him,
I will just eat my words.</font>

365
00:29:24,953 --> 00:29:27,603
<font color="yellow">If I end up dating him,
I'm not Pyo Na Ri, but Pi Na Ri.</font>

366
00:29:27,603 --> 00:29:29,522
<font color="yellow">All right! That's enough!</font>

367
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:31,770
<font color="yellow">Even if he's the
last man left in the world</font>

368
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,473
<font color="yellow">I won't like him again, okay?</font>

369
00:29:47,123 --> 00:29:48,831
<font color="yellow">Go home and sleep.</font>

370
00:29:49,713 --> 00:29:51,540
<font color="yellow">Don't sleep in the dorm all the time.</font>

371
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:53,292
<font color="yellow">Are you busy?</font>

372
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:12,642
<font color="yellow">Are you in a good mood?</font>

373
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:16,476
<font color="yellow">Why are you so happy?</font>

374
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,897
<font color="yellow">Have you gone insane?</font>

375
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:28,078
<font color="yellow">Why would you bother
getting into a fight like that?</font>

376
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,770
<font color="yellow">Do I look pretty, Reporter?</font>

377
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,960
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

378
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:32,628
<font color="yellow">I don't look pretty?</font>

379
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,705
<font color="yellow">You look pretty... you do.</font>

380
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:40,744
<font color="yellow">You try some too. Here.</font>

381
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:43,357
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

382
00:30:43,357 --> 00:30:46,544
<font color="yellow">It's nice if male anchors
have plump and shiny lips.</font>

383
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,655
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat. I think you're hungry.</font>

384
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:51,971
<font color="yellow">Reporter, buy this for me.</font>

385
00:30:52,355 --> 00:30:54,151
<font color="yellow">Why would I buy it for you?</font>

386
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:56,248
<font color="yellow">To commemorate rumors of us dating?</font>

387
00:30:56,248 --> 00:30:57,880
<font color="yellow">Pull yourself together, would you?</font>

388
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,932
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Lee.
- What the...</font>

389
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:06,623
<font color="yellow">I am so happy today.</font>

390
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:09,948
<font color="yellow">My pride felt so crushed</font>

391
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:12,248
<font color="yellow">and now it feels like
it's been revived all at once.</font>

392
00:31:12,248 --> 00:31:14,273
<font color="yellow">- I'm so happy.
- What?</font>

393
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:19,294
<font color="yellow">The entire station knew that I was in a
one-sided love with you for three years.</font>

394
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,514
<font color="yellow">Do you know how embarrassed I was?</font>

395
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:27,916
<font color="yellow">But now people are saying
we are dating each other.</font>

396
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:29,598
<font color="yellow">That's a big deal.</font>

397
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:32,636
<font color="yellow">"He's finally fallen for Pyo Na Ri.
He likes Pyo Na Ri."</font>

398
00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:34,778
<font color="yellow">That's what people will be saying.</font>

399
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:41,430
<font color="yellow">Before, I was just pretending to be mad
and fighting like it was real.</font>

400
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,354
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I am so happy.</font>

401
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:49,859
<font color="yellow">It feels like my sadness was constipation
and it's gone down like diarrhea.</font>

402
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:54,895
<font color="yellow">It would have been better if the rumor
was that you were in a one-sided love.</font>

403
00:31:54,895 --> 00:31:56,640
<font color="yellow">That would've been better.</font>

404
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,682
<font color="yellow">That would've been the icing on the cake.</font>

405
00:31:59,224 --> 00:32:02,455
<font color="yellow">I'm being too greedy, right?</font>

406
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:05,481
<font color="yellow"><i>You like her by yourself.</i></font>

407
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:09,211
<font color="yellow"><i>It's a one-sided love.
Alone... and secretly.</i></font>

408
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:11,657
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

409
00:32:12,136 --> 00:32:14,940
<font color="yellow">I only did it to borrow this.</font>

410
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:21,752
<font color="yellow">Let's go, let's go.</font>

411
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:27,981
<font color="yellow">That's a 20 percent discount
for full-time employees.</font>

412
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:29,742
<font color="yellow">Contract employees don't get it?</font>

413
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:32,742
<font color="yellow">What the heck? That's discriminatory.</font>

414
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:38,591
<font color="yellow">I'll just bring you along
every time I buy makeup.</font>

415
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,906
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

416
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,632
<font color="yellow">It's okay as long as
you and I know it's not true.</font>

417
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:54,710
<font color="yellow">Why are you so concerned with
what others think?</font>

418
00:32:54,734 --> 00:32:57,231
<font color="yellow">It will be over so soon.
I say maybe three days.</font>

419
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:59,040
<font color="yellow">- You have a runny nose.
- What?</font>

420
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,302
<font color="yellow">- A runny nose.
- Oh, do I?</font>

421
00:33:06,964 --> 00:33:08,345
<font color="yellow">Do you find me comfortable?</font>

422
00:33:08,345 --> 00:33:09,376
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

423
00:33:12,496 --> 00:33:14,517
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.
Should I throw it out for you?</font>

424
00:33:15,464 --> 00:33:17,165
<font color="yellow">I would be thankful if you did.</font>

425
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:19,116
<font color="yellow">It's not like you, Reporter.</font>

426
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:22,427
<font color="yellow">I'm not even a man to you, am I?</font>

427
00:33:22,427 --> 00:33:24,886
<font color="yellow">- What?
- You throw it away.</font>

428
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:29,837
<font color="yellow">What's with him?
I didn't ask him to throw it away.</font>

429
00:33:29,861 --> 00:33:33,165
<font color="yellow">He's the one who volunteered.
Why is he getting mad?</font>

430
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:34,659
<font color="yellow">It's the breast cancer.</font>

431
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:37,523
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri changed after
my breast cancer surgery.</font>

432
00:33:37,523 --> 00:33:39,367
<font color="yellow">She wasn't like that before.</font>

433
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:45,707
<font color="yellow">Reporter, you should take this back.</font>

434
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:53,723
<font color="yellow">Just as long as Go Jung Won
doesn't hear this rumor...</font>

435
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:56,233
<font color="yellow">It's okay as long as he doesn't know.</font>

436
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:59,117
<font color="yellow">Hey, is Jung Won the only person
you worry about?</font>

437
00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:01,655
<font color="yellow">I'm the victim of this rumor.</font>

438
00:34:01,655 --> 00:34:03,786
<font color="yellow">You're the one who set me up with him.</font>

439
00:34:03,786 --> 00:34:06,938
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't you feel awkward
if he heard this rumor?</font>

440
00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:09,071
<font color="yellow">It would be weird between friends.</font>

441
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:11,448
<font color="yellow">When did you start thinking of
my friend more than I do?</font>

442
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:13,048
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong in what I'm saying?</font>

443
00:34:13,048 --> 00:34:16,403
<font color="yellow">You're the one who set me up with him,
so why are you acting like this?</font>

444
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,307

00:47:56,285 --> 00:47:57,979
<font color="yellow">A weather forecaster.</font>

594
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:02,102
<font color="yellow">It's President Go! President Go!</font>

595
00:48:02,102 --> 00:48:05,075
<font color="yellow">- One comment, please.
- Are you really dating Announcer Geum?</font>

596
00:48:05,075 --> 00:48:06,823
<font color="yellow">Are you acknowledging
that you two are dating?</font>

597
00:48:06,823 --> 00:48:08,214
<font color="yellow">How long have you two been dating?</font>

598
00:48:08,214 --> 00:48:10,189
<font color="yellow">- One comment.
- Just one comment!</font>

599
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:11,850
<font color="yellow">Can you give us one comment?</font>

600
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,142
<font color="yellow">Do you have anything to say?</font>

601
00:48:16,678 --> 00:48:19,999
<font color="yellow">You know your friend
Reporter Lee Hwa Shin?</font>

602
00:48:19,999 --> 00:48:22,544
<font color="yellow">I heard he's dating the
weather forecaster, Pyo Na Ri.</font>

603
00:48:22,544 --> 00:48:24,484
<font color="yellow">There's a rumor all over the station.</font>

604
00:49:02,747 --> 00:49:04,566
<font color="yellow">I hear she's a weather forecaster.</font>

605
00:49:08,397 --> 00:49:09,598
<font color="yellow">Be good to her.</font>

606
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:13,656
<font color="yellow">Lend her nice clothes and good shoes.</font>

607
00:49:13,656 --> 00:49:16,260
<font color="yellow">However, that's it.</font>

608
00:49:17,379 --> 00:49:20,767
<font color="yellow">I can understand Dad at times like this.</font>

609
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:25,327
<font color="yellow">Go on a cruise instead of
interfering with your son's life.</font>

610
00:49:25,638 --> 00:49:28,464
<font color="yellow">You're behaving this way because you
have too much time on your hands!</font>

611
00:49:33,818 --> 00:49:36,272
<font color="yellow">Are you telling me
to divorce your father?</font>

612
00:49:58,184 --> 00:50:00,981
<font color="yellow"><i>[Taeyang Hospital Appointment]</i></font>

613
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:02,321
<font color="yellow">She can't be...</font>

614
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,912
<font color="yellow"><i>Lee Hwa Shin, you have an
appointment at 6:30 p.m. today.</i></font>

615
00:50:07,912 --> 00:50:13,303
<font color="yellow"><i>Please come to the third floor
radiation treatment clinic.</i></font>

616
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:15,287
<font color="yellow">Please don't be there.</font>

617
00:50:15,872 --> 00:50:17,403
<font color="yellow">Don't be there.</font>

618
00:50:19,088 --> 00:50:20,877
<font color="yellow">You can't be there.</font>

619
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:28,631
<font color="yellow">If you're there on a day like today,
if you're waiting there...</font>

620
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,856
<font color="yellow">what am I supposed to do?</font>

621
00:50:59,102 --> 00:51:01,763
<font color="yellow">I can't let you go to another guy.</font>

622
00:51:10,716 --> 00:51:12,144
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

623
00:51:12,144 --> 00:51:13,515
<font color="yellow">Why are you standing here?</font>

624
00:51:14,334 --> 00:51:16,245
<font color="yellow">We talked about it at the hospital.</font>

625
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:18,205
<font color="yellow">We have to go for treatment at 6:30 p.m.</font>

626
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:20,955
<font color="yellow">We have to go to
the radiation department.</font>

627
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:23,095
<font color="yellow">Then we have to go to
the breast cancer department.</font>

628
00:51:25,354 --> 00:51:28,763
<font color="yellow">We agreed to meet here
30 minutes before the appointment.</font>

629
00:51:32,564 --> 00:51:34,736
<font color="yellow">You won't go on your own.</font>

630
00:51:34,736 --> 00:51:36,955
<font color="yellow">What did you do this whole time?
Were you alone?</font>

631
00:51:38,254 --> 00:51:40,914
<font color="yellow">- I was hungry, so I bought ramen.
- Alone?</font>

632
00:51:40,914 --> 00:51:43,113
<font color="yellow">My mouth hurts. Don't talk to me.</font>

633
00:51:56,961 --> 00:51:59,448
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?
We have to go to the hospital.</font>

634
00:51:59,448 --> 00:52:01,577
<font color="yellow">You're going the opposite direction.</font>

635
00:52:08,564 --> 00:52:10,472
<font color="yellow">You can trust Jung Won.</font>

636
00:52:11,115 --> 00:52:13,176
<font color="yellow">There was a rumor about us dating, too.</font>

637
00:52:13,905 --> 00:52:16,749
<font color="yellow">People said we liked each other,
but are we dating?</font>

638
00:52:16,749 --> 00:52:17,921
<font color="yellow">We're not.</font>

639
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:22,232
<font color="yellow">Just like our rumor is false,
Jung Won's is false too.</font>

640
00:52:22,232 --> 00:52:24,734
<font color="yellow">We have to go now to get to
your appointment on time.</font>

641
00:52:24,734 --> 00:52:26,903
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?
Why are you driving so fast?</font>

642
00:52:26,903 --> 00:52:28,269
<font color="yellow">Slow down.</font>

643
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:31,698
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm going go crazy
if we delay this by even one minute.</font>

644
00:52:31,698 --> 00:52:33,984
<font color="yellow">There won't be another chance
for you or Jung Won.</font>

645
00:52:34,787 --> 00:52:35,879
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

646
00:52:37,294 --> 00:52:40,214
<font color="yellow">This isn't the right way to the hospital.
Where are you going?</font>

647
00:52:40,214 --> 00:52:43,352
<font color="yellow">He's  liked you since he first saw you
on the flight to Thailand.</font>

648
00:52:45,421 --> 00:52:49,513
<font color="yellow">He wished you were sitting
next to him on the flight back.</font>

649
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:53,238
<font color="yellow">He has flown so many miles,
you can't even fathom how many.</font>

650
00:52:53,263 --> 00:52:55,745
<font color="yellow">He's flown around
the world multiple times.</font>

651
00:52:55,745 --> 00:52:58,392
<font color="yellow">And you were the first person
he ever wanted to sit next to.</font>

652
00:52:59,771 --> 00:53:01,890
<font color="yellow">Jung Won probably
didn’t send those flowers either.</font>

653
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:03,327
<font color="yellow">He doesn't like white flowers.</font>

654
00:53:03,327 --> 00:53:07,551
<font color="yellow">Jung Won, that punk, is a crazy guy
who even sends flowers to me.</font>

655
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,943
<font color="yellow">He sent flowers to me
when I won a journalism award.</font>

656
00:53:09,943 --> 00:53:13,064
<font color="yellow">He only ever sends blue flowers.</font>

657
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:17,928
<font color="yellow">The dress he spent all night making
for you was blue too.</font>

658
00:53:21,877 --> 00:53:23,604
<font color="yellow">Let's trust Jung Won.</font>

659
00:53:23,604 --> 00:53:27,727
<font color="yellow">He's a lonelier person than I am.</font>

660
00:53:29,147 --> 00:53:30,825
<font color="yellow">He's more thoughtful than I am.</font>

661
00:53:33,385 --> 00:53:35,675
<font color="yellow">He would treat a girl
better than I would.</font>

662
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:37,274
<font color="yellow">He's richer than me.</font>

663
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:41,879
<font color="yellow">More than anything... he's healthy.</font>

664
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:45,843
<font color="yellow">He's manly and he's tall.</font>

665
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:52,073
<font color="yellow">He wants to give you good shoes and
take you to better places than I would.</font>

666
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:56,604
<font color="yellow">He's just a better...</font>

667
00:53:56,604 --> 00:53:59,754
<font color="yellow">Anyway, do you think I
set you up with him for no reason?</font>

668
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:03,629
<font color="yellow">Also, Jung Won is a victim!</font>

669
00:54:03,629 --> 00:54:07,187
<font color="yellow">It may seem like he lives his life
doing whatever he pleases.</font>

670
00:54:07,187 --> 00:54:09,729
<font color="yellow">He doesn't do anything he wants.
I know that.</font>

671
00:54:09,729 --> 00:54:13,089
<font color="yellow">Why did you set me up
with such a good person?</font>

672
00:54:14,149 --> 00:54:16,493
<font color="yellow">He's called you over 100 times.</font>

673
00:54:19,203 --> 00:54:21,269
<font color="yellow"><i>[113 missed calls: Go Jung Won]</i></font>

674
00:54:27,158 --> 00:54:28,571
<font color="yellow">I'll drive you to him.</font>

00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:49,540
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri came to return this earlier.</font>

678
00:54:52,571 --> 00:54:56,285
<font color="yellow">The reporters left once I told them you
would make an announcement tomorrow.</font>

679
00:55:08,002 --> 00:55:09,396
<font color="yellow">Go on in.</font>

680
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,530
<font color="yellow">Why don't we go to the hospital now?</font>

681
00:55:20,091 --> 00:55:21,109
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

682
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,711
<font color="yellow">You move quickly.</font>

683
00:55:59,084 --> 00:56:01,550
<font color="yellow">What's the meaning of this?
Why did you return it?</font>

684
00:56:03,396 --> 00:56:05,685
<font color="yellow">What was the rush that
you didn't even talk to me...</font>

685
00:56:07,551 --> 00:56:10,285
<font color="yellow">Why did you return it
without even one word to me?</font>

686
00:56:11,024 --> 00:56:12,595
<font color="yellow">Was someone chasing you or something?</font>

687
00:56:13,975 --> 00:56:16,756
<font color="yellow">Was I someone who deserved to be
doubted by you, Pyo Na Ri?</font>

688
00:56:18,357 --> 00:56:20,930
<font color="yellow">What happened to your face?</font>
