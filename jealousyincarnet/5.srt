<i>Episode 5</i>

3
00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:19,696
Hey!

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,219
Are you okay?

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,320
You were fired. Why are you here?

6
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:29,652
Ah, you're here to get your stuff.

7
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:32,940
Yeah, I suppose you should take it
when they tell you to.

8
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:39,432
Take that important butt pad with you.
Is there anything else?

9
00:00:39,432 --> 00:00:40,662
I'll help you.

10
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,545
- Give me that.
- Hey, what are you doing?

11
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,634
You're not going on air, are you?

12
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:56,430
You're going to wear this
tacky thing and go on air?

13
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,471
Yes, I look good.

14
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:17,590
I'm only giving you this opportunity
for one reason.

15
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:22,435
You were under general anesthesia.

16
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:26,121
So you can't eat
until you've passed gas.

17
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:27,198
Okay.

18
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:32,701
It's a sign that your intestines are
active and the anesthesia has worn off.

19
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:36,746
If you feel the need to pass gas,
don't hold back and let it out.

20
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:42,278
Oh yes, are you canceling
the request for a private room?

21
00:01:50,617 --> 00:01:51,709
Yes.

22
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,239
Three minutes until the VCR is done.

23
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:02,158
<i>Director, we have
three minutes until weather.</i>

24
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:05,167
Make a choice about
who you're going to use.

25
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,748
<i>Let's just not do the weather.</i>

26
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:10,397
No, do the weather. Do it.

27
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,282
Should we not do the weather
and just do the closing, Director?

28
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:15,462
Is he crazy? How can we not do it?

29
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:18,182
There is a torrential downpour tonight.

30
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:20,210
We have to warn people
so they can avoid injury.

31
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,793
How can we not do the weather?

32
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:26,733
Why is he taking it out on me? Seriously.

33
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:29,824
He has to choose one of the two.

34
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:32,520
He must be insane.

35
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,866
Why can't you decide?
Pyo Na Ri was fired.

36
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:39,191
Director Oh told me to do it.

37
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,639
Pyo Na Ri, would you please get out?

38
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,823
Wait.

39
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:44,692
Leave already.

40
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,324
I'll be getting my cue soon.
Are you crazy?

41
00:02:47,324 --> 00:02:48,472
Director!

42
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:51,088
I don't know. Anyone, just leave.

43
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,992
Everyone, get ready!

44
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:57,492
What are you doing?
Get ready now! Hurry.

45
00:02:58,938 --> 00:03:01,770
You should leave.
This is my living.

46
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,161
So please get out of here.

47
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:06,020
Director said "anyone" should get out.

48
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,443
What is this? What are they doing?

49
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:11,014
I need to make a living.
Please, you leave.

50
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:12,985
Why are you doing this, Joo Hee?

51
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,323
He said "anyone" should get out.
Am I just anyone?

52
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:17,431
- Why are you being like this?
- You got fired.

53
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,879
- Seriously.
- Stop it.

54
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:27,060
Where did it go?

55
00:03:27,788 --> 00:03:29,015
President...

56
00:03:29,015 --> 00:03:30,409
What did you drop?

57
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:33,079
What did you lose? That remote control?

58
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,057
Isn't it that CG remote? That clicker?

59
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:37,856
You can't control the
CG graphics without it. Wait!

60
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,977
You two can do rock, paper, scissors.

61
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:41,153
Decide now!

62
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:42,902
Who does rock, paper, scissors
in the newsroom?

63
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:46,388
Don't we need that clicker to
change the CG graphics?

64
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:49,527
Can you control the CG without it or not?

65
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:52,105
<i>Director, you can't do it.
What do we do?</i>

66
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:54,960
You can't do it. You can't! Find it now!

67
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,890
- Gosh, seriously!
- <i>We don't have time.</i>

68
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,850
We have 10 seconds.

69
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,164
<i>It's almost time.</i>

70
00:04:02,164 --> 00:04:04,215
We're going to start.
I really don't know anymore.

71
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:07,875
Weather title... go.

72
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:11,262
- Get off.
- What do we do?

73
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:13,603
This is a broadcast accident.

74
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:15,618
- Na Joo Hee, step off.
- No, I don't want to.

75
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:17,591
Pyo Na Ri, step off now!

76
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,346
We can't have a broadcasting accident.
We can't have two.

77
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:22,113
I will come off.

78
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:24,562
Hey! Get off!

79
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:39,952
Hey! Get off!

80
00:04:57,978 --> 00:04:59,581
<i>Mom.</i>

81
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:01,473
<i>Mom, please help me.</i>

82
00:05:01,473 --> 00:05:04,497
<i>I had been saving it,
and I finally wore your dress.</i>

83
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:06,670
<i>What if today is my last day?</i>

84
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,418
<i>What if today isn't the beginning of
being an announcer, but the end?</i>

85
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:11,892
<i>I will be so sorry to you, Mom.
</i>

86
00:05:22,946 --> 00:05:24,264
Na Ri.

87
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,776
The accident happened.

88
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:38,079
We'd better write an apology.

89
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:49,908
It's been a hot and humid summer,
but it's becoming a cool fall.

90
00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:52,129
You can feel the
changing season, can't you?

91
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:54,497
It's the 16th of the
24 seasonal divisions of a year.

92
00:05:54,497 --> 00:05:55,918
During this time of the year

93
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:58,403
temperatures will fall
below the dew point.

94
00:05:58,403 --> 00:05:59,403
What was that?

95
00:05:59,403 --> 00:06:02,209
It's the time of year
you'll find dew on the grass.

96
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:05,031
They say that if it rains in this season,
you're bound to have a rich harvest.

97
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,653
Currently, we haven't had
as much rain as we had last year.

98
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:09,673
We'll take a look at the rain forecast.

99
00:06:10,564 --> 00:06:12,043
Forecaster Na Joo Hee?

100
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,209
Yes.

101
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,141
We're looking at rain clouds
forming to our west.

102
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,836
I don't think I'll die of breast cancer.

103
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:24,891
I'm going to die of frustration
because of you.

104
00:06:25,411 --> 00:06:28,593
This is the first time
I've seen this on the news.

105
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:29,603
Two of them.

106
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:35,345
Thus, rain, lightning, and thunder
are expected all night.

107
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:40,666
Seoul and the Gyeonggi area
are expected to get 150 millimeters.

108
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:45,254
The surrounding rural areas will get a
maximum of 70 millimeters of rain.

109
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:48,838
Please be careful during this
torrential rainstorm.

110
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:51,543
Tomorrow morn...

111
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:58,944
Tomorrow morning,
the rain will have stopped.

112
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:01,994
<i>But the commute to work
will still be dangerous.</i>

113
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:04,418
<i>However, the temperature
will rise during the day.</i>

114
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,418
Seoul and Daejeon, 29 degrees Celsius.

115
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,119
Daegu and Gwangju, 31 degrees Celsius.

116
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,656
Busan and Jeju will reach
28 degrees Celsius.

117
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:18,139
As the high atmospheric system of
the North Pacific passes

118
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,362
<i>we can assume this will be the last
of the hot weather.</i>

119
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,968
Once...

120
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,401
Once this...

121
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:30,523
Once this heat wave subsides,
we will have clear fall weather.

122
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:33,213
That was the weather.

123
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:44,033
What the...

124
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:46,132
What was that?

125
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:57,346
Have you passed gas yet?

126
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:06,502
I asked you if you passed gas.

127
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:09,596
That gas is not
what's important right now.

128
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:13,869
That gas is what's
important for you right now.

129
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:38,552
Senior, this was a
broadcast accident, right?

130
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,743
Reporter.

131
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:12,070
You have no discipline.

132
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:13,701
You should leave if I told you to!

133
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:14,822
You refuse to listen.

134
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:17,047
You insist on being stubborn
and ruining the broadcast?

135
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:20,421
Is the 60 seconds of weather yours?
You think it belongs to you personally?

136
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:23,350
Even if it belonged to you originally,
even if it were yours

137
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,642
what do you the two of you
plan to do in a spot for one?

138
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,432
The two of you caused this mess.

139
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:32,285
Do you think the viewers will even
remember if it will rain or snow?

140
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:36,067
They'll have to watch another channel
for the weather, you little wenches!

141
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,130
I'm so sorry.

142
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:41,236
Director, I'm sorry.

143
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:43,511
I didn't think we'd both
end up standing up here.

144
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:45,113
It was my fault.

145
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:46,879
I was crazy.

146
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,379
I must have lost my mind.

147
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,857
I was being greedy.

148
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:54,996
I seriously lost my mind just before.
I'm so sorry.

149
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:57,321
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

150
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,304
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,860
Can you even dare to say that?

152
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,561
Can those words even leave your mouth?

153
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:08,734
You'd better sew up that mouth of yours.

154
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:12,419
Do you think I'm going to
let the two of you speak again?

155
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:14,683
Wow, seriously...

156
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:18,668
I've seen people with a lot of guts,
but this is really something.

157
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:21,615
I've lived a long time
and this is really something else.

158
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:27,038
Yes, President.

159
00:10:29,057 --> 00:10:31,822
No, I wouldn't call it
a broadcast accident.

160
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:37,461
Yes, about that... no, I didn't do that.

161
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:38,793
No, I didn't.

162
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:43,383
Oh, that person?
It was Reporter Kye who put her there.

163
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:46,408
She is standing next to me.
I'll put her on.

164
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:52,023
Yes, this is Kye Sung Sook.

165
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,980
Yes, I told Na Joo Hee to go on.

166
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:12,322
Director.

167
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:17,018
President, thank you for this outfit.

168
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:18,433
You can leave now, Secretary Cha.

169
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:21,105
I think we should also... wait.

170
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:27,413
What is it? Why? Hold on... what?

171
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:30,573
If you keep doing this...
President! Wait!

172
00:11:37,052 --> 00:11:39,428
Why would she hit the girls?

173
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:44,693
- Yes?
- What happened there?

174
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:46,902
<i>The girls really tried their best.</i>

175
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:50,587
<i>It was the director and Reporter Kye
who went back and forth and caused this.</i>

176
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:52,599
Turn the light off in the newsroom.

177
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,464
Let Reporter Kye reflect on what she did.

178
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,868
Just shine a spotlight on her.

179
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:01,298
What did the
weather forecaster girls do wrong?

180
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:03,153
Having no power is their only crime.

181
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:07,528
What are you doing?
I told you to turn on a spotlight!

182
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:11,192
President.

183
00:12:12,312 --> 00:12:13,572
President.

184
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:16,177
President!

185
00:12:17,356 --> 00:12:21,051
President, what is the point
you're making?

186
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:24,760
You keep repeating yourself and saying
the same thing over and over again.

187
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,331
Are you going to do this all night?

188
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,331
Weathercasters are part of
the news department too.

189
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:33,119
Weather is the last part of the news.

190
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,692
We were only trying to deliver the
weather with dignity and integrity.

191
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:38,341
And there was a slight error.

192
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:42,779
Since when is it necessary
to wear butt and bra pads

193
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,322
and have them wear short skirts
while they stand sideways?

194
00:12:46,322 --> 00:12:48,668
To have an S-line body,
Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan.

195
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,581
When did that become the norm?

196
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:53,030
Because most viewers
of the news are male?

197
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,725
Because you're a male?

198
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:58,494
Gosh, I'm not finished speaking yet.

199
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:00,649
Please don't interrupt or say anything.

200
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,649
Please just listen!

201
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:07,664
If you keep interrupting me,
I have to keep repeating myself too.

202
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,474
It's going to be torture for you.

203
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:15,467
My point is that the weather
can be done by men and women.

204
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,629
Looks are not the priority.

205
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:22,658
The dignified attitude in which you
deliver the news is what's important.

206
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:25,614
Understand? Are you okay?

207
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:27,854
Hel...

208
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,732
Ah, I want to drink.

209
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:42,113
Ah, I want a man.

210
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:47,188
Ah, I want someone on my side.

211
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,682
I'll take you home right now.

212
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:56,104
You sponsored clothes for Na Joo Hee too?

213
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:58,395
You shouldn't talk to the director
on a day like today.

214
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,283
He will only be angry at you if you do.

215
00:14:00,283 --> 00:14:01,969
What's with your bosses here?

216
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:03,871
Are you a fan of Na Joo Hee?

217
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:06,293
Don't think about anything on
a day like today and just sleep.

218
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:07,879
Stop changing the subject.

219
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:13,599
Then, why did you kick that
remote control to me?

220
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:16,010
Of all the things
I wanted to give to you

221
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,000
that remote is the
only thing that got to you.

222
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:22,043
Do you still need friends and lovers?

223
00:14:26,374 --> 00:14:29,029
Pyo Na Ri, are you okay?

224
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:32,251
What's wrong with "Head in the Clouds"?
Are you okay?

225
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:34,350
- Should I call an ambulance?
- Get the car.

226
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:39,421
President, isn't this the bracelet
they give to patients at the hospital?

227
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,331
- Then, let's go there.
- Okay.

228
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:43,837
I'll carry her.

229
00:14:43,837 --> 00:14:45,591
I told you to go get the car!

230
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:46,639
Yes!

231
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,163
Gosh, that girl.

232
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:55,082
She needs to get here soon.
Is she getting in trouble?

233
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:52,407
<i>This customer is unable
to come to the phone...</i>

234
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:54,003
Is the phone turned off?

235
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:57,211
What kind of sister always
makes her little brother worry?

236
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:59,097
Something is off.

237
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:00,517
Of course it is.

238
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:04,246
How much work is required for 60 seconds
that two people would share?

239
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:06,772
Are they going to
split the pay in half too?

240
00:16:07,777 --> 00:16:09,408
Na Ri never said anything to you?

241
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:17,706
Do you know where Taeyang Hospital is?

242
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:20,147
Yes, it's the most nearby hospital.

243
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:37,373
I think it's her phone.

244
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:44,520
Are you awake?

245
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:50,938
Don't get up.

246
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:52,552
You should stay like this.

247
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:08,667
The anesthesia must be wearing off.

248
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:13,598
It could be your family.
Shouldn't you pick up?

249
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:15,786
Maybe it's Chi Yeol.

250
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:19,332
Hello?

251
00:17:20,182 --> 00:17:21,452
Where are you?

252
00:17:21,452 --> 00:17:23,231
<i>Are you on your way now?</i>

253
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:24,849
None of your business.

254
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:30,431
I told you to go on a date
and just get married, didn't I?

255
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:34,622
You went under anesthesia, got your
chest opened up, and had surgery.

256
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:36,442
You really don't listen, do you?

257
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:40,301
You just pulled that IV out
and ran out of here like that.

258
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:43,021
Then you go through that nonsense.
Now look at you.

259
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,090
It serves you right. It really does.

260
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,849
Get back to the hospital now!

261
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:51,461
Forget it! You stay put right there.

262
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:55,151
I'm going to send the
hospital's ambulance.

263
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:56,861
Hello?

264
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:01,251
Where did she go?

265
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:04,737
Why does he keep telling me to
go on a date and get married?

266
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:10,788
You need a job to go on an arranged date.

267
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:13,696
Who would want to be set up with me
when I'm about to be fired?

268
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:23,445
By the way, where are we going now?

269
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:30,172
Where is this?

270
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,180
The day the station finds out

271
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,415
being an anchor and
auditioning are over for me.

272
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:43,758
<i>Once it becomes known,
my career as a reporter is over.</i>

273
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:46,910
You just need to
keep quiet about it, okay?

274
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:49,419
No, I can't be here. No!

275
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,471
No, no! Go to a different hospital. No.

276
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:55,220
Oh no! No, you can't.

277
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,666
No, no!

278
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,980
Please come out.

279
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,019
No, no. I'll go to a
different hospital, not this one.

280
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:03,137
Just not this one.

281
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:05,606
We saw the bracelet on your wrist
and that's why we're here.

282
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:08,117
- Don't worry. Take her, Secretary Cha.
- Yes.

283
00:19:08,117 --> 00:19:10,911
No, no. Wait a minute!
There's a better hospital over there.

284
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:13,483
I'll just go to that one, not this one.

285
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:15,383
No, we should definitely go to this one.

286
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:18,650
- No, no! I can't!
- Just get out, please.

287
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,981
No, I can go to any hospital
except this one. Please!

288
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:23,394
Your hand...

289
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:25,726
Hurry up and get in.

290
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:28,310
Pyo Na Ri...

291
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,372
No, I'm not getting out. Just get in.

292
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:32,491
I just can't go to this hospital.
Please get back in.

293
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:35,356
- Just let go of his leg.
- Hurry!

294
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:39,669
I'll be fine on my own now.
You can go now, okay?

295
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:42,576
This is the hospital you were admitted.
What's the problem?

296
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:43,784
Are you taking her to her room?

297
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:44,896
- No, no, no!
- Yes.

298
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:47,593
Take me to the ER. I need to go there.

299
00:19:47,593 --> 00:19:49,173
I need to be seen immediately.

300
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:50,863
Calm down, okay? Stay calm.

301
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:52,692
- No, you can't.
- Secretary Cha.

302
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,877
Go press the elevator button.

303
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:57,576
I'm in pain. It hurts! Go to the ER!

304
00:19:57,576 --> 00:20:00,500
- Calm down.
- No! You can't.

305
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,244
You can't! You can't!

306
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,834
I don't know anymore!

307
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:10,092
Why isn't she coming?

308
00:20:22,602 --> 00:20:24,092
Are you in a lot of pain?

309
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:27,577
<i>[Pyo Na Ri]</i>

310
00:20:45,971 --> 00:20:48,321
The doctor will be here soon.
Are you her guardian?

311
00:20:48,321 --> 00:20:49,378
- Yes.
- Yes.

312
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,849
Why would the two of you be my guardians?

313
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:57,098
<i>She brought people
from the station with her?</i>

314
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,604
Can you both wait outside?

315
00:21:04,604 --> 00:21:06,819
I'm her guardian, so can't I stay?

316
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:11,528
<i>That girl did this on purpose.</i>

317
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:13,579
Then, do you want to
change her into this?

318
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,824
- What?
- What? No.

319
00:21:17,106 --> 00:21:19,294
- Let's wait outside.
- Okay.

320
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:20,490
Yes.

321
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:25,161
Let's get you up.

322
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:27,482
Be careful.

323
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:37,097
- Hey, are you crazy?
- Patient, are you crazy?

324
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:38,957
I knew this would happen.

325
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,054
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

326
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:44,124
You made a mess at work so now
you're going to live recklessly?

327
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:48,182
You're going start a rumor about my
breast cancer and do what, exactly?

328
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,455
You're going to broadcast it?

329
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:50,744
Is that it?

330
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,025
Don't you care about my life at all,
you awful wench?

331
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,338
Wow, I was a stupid fool.

332
00:21:57,338 --> 00:21:59,563
I was stupid for trusting a woman.

333
00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:06,964
Living recklessly?

334
00:22:06,964 --> 00:22:11,096
Patient, you shouldn't get angry.
Your surgery wound could tear.

335
00:22:14,403 --> 00:22:15,895
On purpose?

336
00:22:15,895 --> 00:22:19,117
Wow... yes, you are right.

337
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:22,453
That broadcast accident
didn't satisfy my anger.

338
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:24,777
So I planned it and brought him.

339
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:28,214
He's the biggest gossip
at the entire station.

340
00:22:29,964 --> 00:22:32,655
He won't even
tell the truth of the facts.

341
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:35,037
He loves to elaborate and lie.

342
00:22:35,037 --> 00:22:38,380
He posts things on the work intranet.

343
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,878
He's also someone who would
leak things to our competitors.

344
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:46,056
Yes, I brought someone who lies
every time he opens his mouth.

345
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:49,082
I really am sorry.

346
00:22:49,472 --> 00:22:50,723
I should have just died.

347
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:53,152
Instead, I did something
I deserve to die for.

348
00:22:54,532 --> 00:22:59,545
I had my surgery and everything,
but I guess I'll die by your hands.

349
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,585
Yes, that's how it is.

350
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:04,064
I can't even go on air anymore.

351
00:23:04,064 --> 00:23:07,486
It won't be so bad to die by your hands.

352
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:12,896
I did barely manage
to get life insurance.

353
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,990
- Yes, I did.
- Hey.

354
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,621
That man outside is someone
who can give me 100 million won.

355
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:24,269
It's very hard for me to
keep this mouth of mine shut.

356
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,440
What should I do, Reporter?

357
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:27,602
100 million won?

358
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,730
Yes, 100 million won.

359
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:39,185
Putting people in new clothes
is actually our expertise.

360
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:46,711
I came up here in such a rush.

361
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:48,270
Which department is this?

362
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:50,895
Is she very sick?

363
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:56,291
Are you really going to cheat like this?

364
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:58,959
Go and buy something to drink.
Don't stay here.

365
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:02,512
It's her you're cheating with, right?
But it's just a passing breeze.

366
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:04,497
Someone might overhear
and think I'm a playboy.

367
00:24:04,497 --> 00:24:05,836
That's what I'm saying.

368
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:09,644
You've always been lazy with dating
and only ever liked your friends.

369
00:24:09,644 --> 00:24:12,663
Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

370
00:24:12,663 --> 00:24:16,243
I can't date girls who act like girls,
like Announcer Geum Soo Jung.

371
00:24:16,243 --> 00:24:18,053
I'm already lazy.

372
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:19,761
I need a girl who is like a friend.

373
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:25,311
Oh, so that "Head in the Clouds"
is a girl who is like a friend?

374
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:29,001
Well, she's not a girly girl.

375
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:35,277
- Are you busy?
- No.

376
00:24:35,277 --> 00:24:36,723
Aren't you going to buy drinks?

377
00:24:39,307 --> 00:24:42,608
I will... I will buy some.

378
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:45,757
Buy something healthy.

379
00:24:45,757 --> 00:24:48,779
I just don't know anymore.

380
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:52,239
Once your mother comes back,
I'm going to tell her everything.

381
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:05,067
Here you go.

382
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,384
You must like saffron.

383
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,990
Oh, yes.

384
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,180
I'll have this.

385
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,580
That must be why Red knew to order this.

386
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,865
My Red ordered the saffron pasta?

387
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:24,088
Yes.

388
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:33,272
Please enjoy your food.

389
00:25:33,272 --> 00:25:34,778
Yes, Chef.

390
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:44,415
I'm the only person Red calls "Mom."

391
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:51,567
Excuse me.

392
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:55,746
If you don't want to eat alone,
should I sit down with you?

393
00:25:56,515 --> 00:26:00,163
Yes, I would be very thankful if you did.

394
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:06,790
I almost always eat alone.
Eating alone makes the food taste bad.

395
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,002
I feel the same way.

396
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:09,719
I grow very tired of it.

397
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:11,856
No matter how good the food is

398
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:14,739
there is nothing as bad as food
that you have to eat alone.

399
00:26:15,469 --> 00:26:17,273
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

400
00:26:17,273 --> 00:26:19,150
- Have you already done it once?
- What?

401
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,890
Ah!

402
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,132
No, I have never been married.

403
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,782
- Why is that?
- Well...

404
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,345
Here you go.

405
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:35,846
What are you talking about?

406
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:38,585
I was the one in pain
and giving birth to her.

407
00:26:39,661 --> 00:26:42,689
Are you busy? Please sit.

408
00:26:47,676 --> 00:26:50,678
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

409
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:52,156
What about a wife?

410
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:54,993
The order of your questions
is quite interesting.

411
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:57,922
Reporters usually start out strong first.

412
00:26:58,615 --> 00:26:59,878
I don't have a wife.

413
00:26:59,878 --> 00:27:01,075
Any children?

414
00:27:05,723 --> 00:27:07,411
Have you ever craved alcohol?

415
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,000
Have you ever craved a woman?

416
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,163
- No.
- Liar.

417
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:20,304
Uncle Rak.

418
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:23,440
Yes, Red.

419
00:27:25,054 --> 00:27:26,528
How's your dad?

420
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:29,029
Are you hungry? What do you want?

421
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:30,891
Here. Eat up.

422
00:27:30,891 --> 00:27:32,393
Thank you for the food.

423
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:38,162
- Red.
- Yes?

424
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:41,284
- You really don't miss your mom?
- I don't.

425
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,362
- You don't need your mom?
- No.

426
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:47,511
- Eat lots.
- Okay.

427
00:27:50,992 --> 00:27:53,336
Hey... hold still.

428
00:27:57,816 --> 00:28:00,851
You should do this for a woman.
Aren't you going to get married?

429
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:03,458
It's not that I'm not. It's that I can't.

430
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:11,946
Ah, excuse me...

431
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,624
Why did you bother coming back?

432
00:28:20,624 --> 00:28:22,281
Who took this patient back?

433
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:26,733
I thought it was just this patient who
didn't listen, but you're all the same.

434
00:28:27,393 --> 00:28:29,192
Are my words a joke to you?

435
00:28:29,192 --> 00:28:31,750
I'm sorry, Doctor. I'm sorry.

436
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:35,044
Neither your grandmother nor mother
ever acted this way.

437
00:28:35,044 --> 00:28:36,827
Where did the daughter
learn such bad manners?

438
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:39,125
I'm sorry. I won't ever do it again.

439
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:43,334
Her temperature and BP are a bit high.

440
00:28:43,334 --> 00:28:44,522
Should I keep checking...

441
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:45,570
Of course.

442
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:48,064
- Are you the guardian?
- Yes.

443
00:28:48,064 --> 00:28:51,958
Because she didn't have a guardian,
she didn't listen to me and ran away.

444
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:53,598
This is all your fault.

445
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:57,542
From now on,
watch over her for 24 hours a day.

446
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:59,076
Do not let this happen again.

447
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:01,894
- Understand? Do you understand!
- Yes.

448
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:04,275
I'm going to check the wound.

449
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:12,615
Does it hurt?

450
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:14,474
A little bit.

451
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:19,307
Don't hold back and tell me if it hurts.

452
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:22,608
I know you're good at
enduring pain, Pyo Na Ri.

453
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:24,432
At the hospital,
you're only fooling your doctor.

454
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:26,778
You're becoming a fraud. Understand?

455
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:31,046
Just in case, change the painkillers
if she complains tonight.

456
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:33,259
- Take new scans too.
- Okay.

457
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:37,292
Grandma.

458
00:29:39,332 --> 00:29:40,730
Grandma.

459
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:43,861
Yes?

460
00:29:45,144 --> 00:29:46,993
I'll be coming in now.

461
00:29:51,134 --> 00:29:52,493
Grandma.

462
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:56,115
We have the pathology results
from the surgery.

463
00:29:56,115 --> 00:29:59,373
Do you want to talk now or later?

464
00:30:01,442 --> 00:30:04,604
Grandma, the heavens have helped you.

465
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:07,989
People often think that its
a knot in the muscle.

466
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:10,891
They don't find out
until it's stage three or four.

467
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:14,213
You suspected it was breast cancer
and came to the hospital early.

468
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:17,327
It is a huge relief.

469
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:20,251
You need to bow down in thanks

470
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,720
to the person who told you
to go to the hospital.

471
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,768
The lymph nodes have not changed.

472
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:29,434
You chose partial extraction,
so the mammary gland still remains.

473
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:32,842
You must come to the hospital daily for
six weeks to get radiation therapy.

474
00:30:32,842 --> 00:30:35,625
You must receive that treatment.

475
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,710
You absolutely must.

476
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:43,410
Here at the breast cancer clinic,
every day.

477
00:30:45,105 --> 00:30:46,501
Promise?

478
00:30:47,938 --> 00:30:49,227
Come on, now.

479
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,913
You must.

480
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:56,911
Okay!

481
00:31:08,195 --> 00:31:09,743
Ah, a private room?

482
00:31:10,923 --> 00:31:15,516
Grandma, are you going to keep
changing your mind like this?

483
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:18,935
You said to earlier,
"I don't want a private room."

484
00:31:18,935 --> 00:31:20,946
Don't you recall that?

485
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:28,573
Grandma, there are...

486
00:31:28,573 --> 00:31:30,147
no private rooms.

487
00:31:30,147 --> 00:31:31,413
Not anymore!

488
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:58,308
Aren't you going home?

489
00:31:58,308 --> 00:32:02,788
She said I should watch over you
24 hours a day.

490
00:32:07,068 --> 00:32:09,868
But... why are you suddenly
dropping honorifics?

491
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:18,731
Does Hwa Shin know too,
about you being sick?

492
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:21,576
No, of course not. He wouldn't know.

493
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:24,625
Reporter Lee doesn't even
have this much interest in me.

494
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:26,070
That's a relief.

495
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:52,180
Where are you going?

496
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,749
We're here to see Pyo Na Ri,
who just did the 7 p.m. weather.

497
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,154
Call her and tell her to come out.

498
00:32:59,154 --> 00:33:01,486
- I can't reach her on the phone.
- You can't go in.

499
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:04,551
Hold on, Mister. Please, let us in.

500
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:06,779
My sister really is
a weather forecaster here.

501
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,332
Her name is Pyo Na Ri.
She's the best at weather.

502
00:33:09,332 --> 00:33:11,093
Yes, I understand, but you have to go.

503
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:12,865
Wait, I'll just be a moment.

504
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,511
- You have to leave.
- I'll only be a second.

505
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:15,617
You have to go.

506
00:33:15,617 --> 00:33:17,974
- I just need to see her face.
- Excuse me.

507
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:21,664
- Reporter Kye.
- You can let them in.

508
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,826
Pardon?

509
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:24,913
Ah, okay.

510
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:31,123
What are you doing?

511
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:39,211
- Thank you so much, Reporter.
- Thank you very much.

512
00:33:41,378 --> 00:33:43,298
That door at the end is the office.

513
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:44,763
Thank you.

514
00:33:51,605 --> 00:33:54,432
She must have left already.
She isn't here.

515
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:56,652
Hey!

516
00:33:58,991 --> 00:34:02,332
Reporter! Reporter, wait!

517
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,471
You know my sister, don't you?

518
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:08,718
I do.

519
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:10,990
Is she going to get fired?

520
00:34:13,503 --> 00:34:16,052
Is she someone who would
be fired so easily?

521
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:18,550
You ought to know.
You're her little brother.

522
00:34:28,394 --> 00:34:31,056
I'll put these in here, so drink them.

523
00:34:31,056 --> 00:34:32,597
I will. Thank you.

524
00:34:32,597 --> 00:34:33,989
No need to thank me.

525
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,762
I wonder if that grandma is sleeping.

526
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:39,262
Yes, she must be.

527
00:34:39,262 --> 00:34:41,693
I suppose grandmas sleep early.

528
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:46,242
It must get stuffy in there,
but she's keeping the curtains shut.

529
00:34:46,242 --> 00:34:47,436
Goodness.

530
00:34:48,775 --> 00:34:51,425
By the way, about that remote control

531
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:55,025
what gave you the idea to hide it
under your foot and kick it to me?

532
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:57,884
People would know
if I tossed it to you by hand.

533
00:34:57,884 --> 00:35:00,472
Then they might take it away from you.

534
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:03,077
I wanted to make sure I got it to you.

535
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:05,338
Do you know how nervous I was?

536
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:08,514
If it weren't for that remote control

537
00:35:08,514 --> 00:35:12,208
I don't think I would've been able
to handle it and would've run away.

538
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,358
You did a good thing
by standing your ground.

539
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:16,036
Do you really think so?

540
00:35:16,036 --> 00:35:19,057
The station might give you a warning
because the two of you did it together.

541
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,469
You don't need to fear that.

542
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:22,969
That's how the weak have to survive.

543
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:25,699
If you ran away,
you wouldn't get another chance.

544
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:30,682
You'd be in the studio thinking,
"Two people can never stand there."

545
00:35:30,682 --> 00:35:33,469
Suppose you let that spot go
for the sake of the station.

546
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:36,492
You wouldn't just get a warning.
You'd be branded as the one who lost.

547
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:40,168
A warning is better than
being the one who lost.

548
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,583
Maybe you're right.

549
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:46,643
You did well.

550
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:59,318
What a joke.

551
00:36:05,224 --> 00:36:07,110
Oh my! Oh my...

552
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:17,130
Oh, wow.

553
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:21,867
Oh my gosh.

554
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:29,186
What kind of a woman farts like that?

555
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:33,818
That's not a woman, right? It's a man.

556
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:36,536
What? A man... the grandma?

557
00:36:39,387 --> 00:36:41,648
I'm just kidding. It's a joke.

558
00:36:41,648 --> 00:36:43,864
It smells like a man's.

559
00:36:45,317 --> 00:36:49,657
She sure farts a lot in her sleep.

560
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,981
Should I open the window?

561
00:36:51,981 --> 00:36:55,128
Window? It's on that side.

562
00:36:55,668 --> 00:36:58,512
That grandma must have
had surgery today too.

563
00:37:00,322 --> 00:37:03,478
Hey! Get rid of him now.

564
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:17,599
- Are you sleepy?
- Yes.

565
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,903
You can't sleep because of me.

566
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:22,856
Yes, I'll sleep once you leave.

567
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:24,405
I'll leave once you sleep.

568
00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:27,447
No, I can only sleep if you leave.

569
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:30,275
I can only leave if I see you sleeping.

570
00:37:34,242 --> 00:37:35,858
- Let's go, President.
- Yes.

571
00:37:35,858 --> 00:37:37,675
You should go. Go, go.

572
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,485
Thank you for everything today.

573
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:10,320
Unexpectedly, I've become
very indebted to you.

574
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,610
We even smelled the fart of the
grandma in the bed next to you.

575
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,768
Why are you being so formal
now that I'm leaving?

576
00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:19,413
You're being very stiff with me.

577
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:22,461
I've been very out of it today.

578
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:25,148
I thought we'd become closer.

579
00:38:25,148 --> 00:38:28,150
We have become closer,
so I should say goodbye properly.

580
00:38:30,887 --> 00:38:33,909
Ah... don't come back again.

581
00:38:35,793 --> 00:38:37,581
I'm going to be discharged soon.

582
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:46,197
Also, I'll buy you a meal to repay you
for everything you did for me today.

583
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:50,702
I won't forget how you were
my guardian today.

584
00:38:57,425 --> 00:38:58,458
Well, then...

585
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,617
Goodnight.

586
00:39:41,516 --> 00:39:44,465
This is just patient care,
so don't feel too burdened.

587
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,550
Don't feel too much pain in your heart
since you had surgery.

588
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,543
I had Secretary Cha look into it.

589
00:39:50,543 --> 00:39:54,822
Today's weather had double the ratings
with the two of you in it.

590
00:39:54,822 --> 00:39:56,920
I think you'll get another chance.

591
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,032
Don't worry about getting fired.

592
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,063
Goodnight.

593
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:29,681
Wait...

594
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:40,518
Isn't this too fast?

595
00:40:40,518 --> 00:40:42,447
It is fast.

596
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:45,530
But it's not a no, right?

597
00:40:57,552 --> 00:40:59,568
<i>So, then why...</i>

598
00:40:59,568 --> 00:41:02,199
<i>Why did you try to
rush me off so quickly?</i>

599
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,494
Are you scared?

600
00:41:05,918 --> 00:41:07,143
Are you afraid?

601
00:41:08,423 --> 00:41:12,380
Did you really think I was running
around all day just as your guardian?

602
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,166
Getting in trouble by the doctor

603
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:19,237
while sitting around by your side
sympathizing with you, who couldn't eat.

604
00:41:19,237 --> 00:41:22,141
Gosh, you really don't know men.

605
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:29,628
Are you dense?

606
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:34,483
Or are you just bad at dating?

607
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,181
You're Reporter Lee's friend though.

608
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:45,556
You said Hwa Shin doesn't even
have this much interest in you.

609
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,228
So why does it matter?

610
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:49,789
True. That's true.

611
00:41:53,286 --> 00:41:56,867
In Thailand, you know when
we all shared an umbrella?

612
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:58,320
There was thunder.

613
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:02,050
You didn't jump into my arms.

614
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:05,413
I... pulled you into my arms.

615
00:42:27,971 --> 00:42:29,322
Did you have some tom yum?

616
00:42:29,322 --> 00:42:31,166
- We're almost there.
- Is it good there?

617
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:32,523
It's not good.

618
00:43:19,398 --> 00:43:20,661
You didn't know?

619
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:36,887
<i>[Go Jung Won] </i>

620
00:43:57,983 --> 00:43:59,222
Hello?

621
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,554
Are you busy?

622
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,512
<i>No, I'm going to go home.</i>

623
00:44:02,512 --> 00:44:04,295
Are you keeping any secrets from me?

624
00:44:04,295 --> 00:44:05,333
Secrets?

625
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:07,922
No.

626
00:44:09,969 --> 00:44:12,184
I can keep a secret from you, right?

627
00:44:12,184 --> 00:44:14,646
Why bother having a
useless thing like that?

628
00:44:14,646 --> 00:44:18,471
How can I only do useful things in life?

629
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:20,827
Let's do something useless.

630
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,818
- Are you okay?
- Of course I am.

631
00:44:25,108 --> 00:44:28,539
I found out about a
great investment in Thailand.

632
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:31,945
I'm going to go in on it by myself.

633
00:44:31,945 --> 00:44:35,567
<i>You're already overflowing with money.
You don't need to know, right?</i>

634
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:36,952
No, I don't.

635
00:44:38,818 --> 00:44:41,105
You should go to the gym on your own
for a little while.

636
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:42,327
I'm going to take a break.

637
00:44:42,327 --> 00:44:44,775
I'm a little busy preparing
for my audition.

638
00:44:44,775 --> 00:44:47,945
<i>Okay, when are you starting work?</i>

639
00:44:47,945 --> 00:44:49,315
I have a few days left.

640
00:44:51,617 --> 00:44:56,590
Hwa Shin, you know that
weathercaster I met in Bangkok?

641
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,041
Pyo Na Ri.

642
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,367
Pyo Na Ri is sick.

643
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:06,697
<i>I went to the station for my work
and I saw her passed out.</i>

644
00:45:07,211 --> 00:45:08,940
<i>I took her to the hospital.</i>

645
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:12,737
That's great.

646
00:45:13,148 --> 00:45:14,173
Yeah.

647
00:45:16,554 --> 00:45:18,228
You did a really good thing.

648
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:20,333
<i>Yes.</i>

649
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:23,065
Okay.

650
00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:27,398
Okay, go on home. I'll call again.

651
00:45:27,398 --> 00:45:28,827
Okay.

652
00:45:39,005 --> 00:45:43,338
That will be all for SBC News Reader.

653
00:45:43,338 --> 00:45:44,996
Have a good night.

654
00:45:48,715 --> 00:45:51,833
<i>This was Bang Ja Young's Exciting Night.</i>

655
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:54,677
That will be all for tonight.

656
00:45:54,677 --> 00:45:58,487
I will meet you all again tomorrow.

657
00:45:58,487 --> 00:45:59,739
Goodnight.

658
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,559
<i>The doors are now closing.</i>

659
00:46:55,282 --> 00:46:56,570
Did you drink?

660
00:46:57,068 --> 00:46:58,851
You drank alcohol and went on air?

661
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:03,117
You said something to Pyo Na Ri about it
and you did the news after drinking?

662
00:47:03,117 --> 00:47:04,750
What's wrong with you, ma'am?

663
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,307
What's with all the perfume?

664
00:47:08,248 --> 00:47:11,847
Who are you trying to seduce that
you're acting so pathetic, ma'am?

665
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:14,108
You're crazy. You're an anchor.

666
00:47:14,108 --> 00:47:17,271
You're cut off from TV and doing
radio where no one sees you.

667
00:47:17,271 --> 00:47:20,900
You sprayed on a bottle of perfume.
You're just acting atrociously.

668
00:47:21,831 --> 00:47:24,648
What? Should I drag you to a police
station and throw you in jail?

669
00:47:24,648 --> 00:47:27,177
Being drunk on air
is worse than drunk driving.

670
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,757
You're just telling the nation
drunken nonsense, not news.

671
00:47:30,759 --> 00:47:34,090
- Why, you! I was upset so I had drink.
- What?

672
00:47:37,974 --> 00:47:39,891
- Get off.
- Come on.

673
00:48:10,251 --> 00:48:13,686
I'm so sick of the fact that we entered
this company in the same year.

674
00:48:13,686 --> 00:48:17,668
It's a curse that we're retiring
at the same age too.

675
00:48:17,668 --> 00:48:19,960
Can you please just leave first?

676
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,300
Do you know how much people
laugh behind our backs?

677
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,820
This is all your fault!

678
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:26,833
Why is it my fault?

679
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:31,898
Ever since I met you,
my entire life has become twisted.

680
00:48:31,898 --> 00:48:35,032
You stole my daughter, Red.

681
00:48:35,034 --> 00:48:38,215
- You stole my husband too!
- Hey!

682
00:48:39,141 --> 00:48:40,447
You threw them away.

683
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,233
Who are you accusing of stealing them?

684
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:47,059
Who are you blaming for
your life being twisted around?

685
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:48,682
You awful woman.

686
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:53,074
You wench, you wench, you wench,
you wench, you wench!

687
00:48:53,074 --> 00:48:54,980
It's all your fault!

688
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:57,105
Who do you think you are?

689
00:48:57,746 --> 00:48:59,965
Let go! Let go of it.

690
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,920
You die too!

691
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:17,273
If you had been living happily,
I would never have met your husband.

692
00:49:17,273 --> 00:49:21,963
If you had raised her well,
we wouldn't both be unable to see her.

693
00:49:21,963 --> 00:49:25,871
We wouldn't be forgotten
and ignored by Red like this.

694
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:29,585
Even if it's my fault that
we're all living apart like this

695
00:49:29,585 --> 00:49:32,534
why don't you know that you
have bigger faults than me?

696
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:35,101
Why don't you know?
Why are you the only one?

697
00:49:35,101 --> 00:49:37,092
You'd better resign tomorrow.

698
00:49:37,092 --> 00:49:40,141
I'm embarrassed to work
in the same place as you.

699
00:49:40,141 --> 00:49:43,186
I feel dirty, like my body is inside out.

700
00:49:43,186 --> 00:49:45,860
Hey, it's like I'm looking in the mirror.

701
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,284
I think of myself when I look at you
and I think of you when I look at myself.

702
00:49:49,284 --> 00:49:52,269
The people at work talk behind our backs.

703
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:55,728
I'm the one who feels like
I'm going crazy.

704
00:49:55,728 --> 00:49:57,996
Seriously, I'm so angry.

705
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:41,003
How can you fart in front of a man?

706
00:50:41,003 --> 00:50:42,710
Is there a man here?

707
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,900
When did you two get so close?

708
00:50:47,137 --> 00:50:49,065
He's your close friend.

709
00:50:49,065 --> 00:50:51,387
Why can't you tell your friend?

710
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:52,487
I don't want to.

711
00:50:52,487 --> 00:50:57,396
He doesn't seem like the type to
go around telling people about it.

712
00:50:57,396 --> 00:50:59,284
He wouldn't.

713
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:02,619
I know him better than you.
I still don't want to.

714
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,699
Then, you must not be that close.

715
00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:06,811
Even though he's my friend

716
00:51:06,811 --> 00:51:08,800
I don't want to tell him
about my breast cancer.

717
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,570
He'll be worried.

718
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:15,208
He's already the kind of person
who gives too much of what's his.

719
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:16,914
He'll give even more
if he knows I'm sick.

720
00:51:17,527 --> 00:51:21,239
Then our friendship will turn into pity.

721
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:24,572
Then I'll just become so pitiful.
I hate that.

722
00:51:24,572 --> 00:51:27,103
On top of that, it's my chest.
A man's chest...

723
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,300
Gosh, not the man's chest again.

724
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,516
A woman's chest must mean nothing.

725
00:51:37,231 --> 00:51:38,576
Why, you...

726
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,315
I can't control it. What can I do?

727
00:51:44,315 --> 00:51:45,393
I'm sorry.

728
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,952
What do you mean you can't control it?

729
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:51,505
You'll be embarrassed if you
let it all out at once.

730
00:51:51,505 --> 00:51:56,112
You're letting it out little by little
like a bag letting out air.

731
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,391
How dirty.

732
00:52:02,523 --> 00:52:04,085
Is it because of me?

733
00:52:05,795 --> 00:52:06,833
Do you still like me?

734
00:52:08,213 --> 00:52:09,771
I'm still a man to you.

735
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:16,061
Well, you did kiss me first.

736
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:20,702
How can you say you don't
like me overnight, right?

737
00:52:27,822 --> 00:52:29,965
You can think whatever you'd like.

738
00:52:31,076 --> 00:52:36,666
But I really ended everything
with you yesterday, Reporter.

739
00:52:37,132 --> 00:52:40,882
It's very tiring and difficult
because I got dumped.

740
00:52:40,882 --> 00:52:42,791
Please stop bothering me.

741
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:45,581
Hey, let's be clear about this.

742
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:48,385
What do you mean you got dumped?

743
00:52:48,385 --> 00:52:52,298
You're the one who liked me and disliked
me by yourself with all your emotions.

744
00:52:52,298 --> 00:52:54,920
You liked and then stopped liking
all on your own.

745
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,760
I suppose you got dumped,
but it was your own doing.

746
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:01,371
You were in a one-sided love.
Dumped, yeah right.

747
00:53:01,371 --> 00:53:04,782
Gosh! All right, you're right.

748
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:07,692
I got dumped and gave myself
a broken heart.

749
00:53:09,405 --> 00:53:10,943
Don't turn your back on me.

750
00:53:10,943 --> 00:53:13,179
You're planning on
farting in my direction.

751
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:18,148
How can two friends be so different,
even in the way they talk?

752
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:24,052
<i>Does Hwa Shin know too,
about you being sick?</i>

753
00:53:24,052 --> 00:53:25,181
No, of course not.

754
00:53:25,181 --> 00:53:28,371
Reporter Lee doesn't even have
this much interest in me.

755
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,608
That's a relief.

756
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:32,090
<i>Goodnight.</i>

757
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:37,871
Don't turn your back on me.

758
00:53:37,871 --> 00:53:40,157
It's dangerous.

759
00:53:43,608 --> 00:53:45,070
I'm hungry.

760
00:53:46,001 --> 00:53:48,213
- I can't sleep because I'm hungry.
- Me too.

761
00:54:02,548 --> 00:54:03,778
Are you sleeping?

762
00:54:06,851 --> 00:54:09,233
- Are you sleeping, Pi Na Ri?
- I'm sleeping.

763
00:54:12,027 --> 00:54:15,231
- I'm going to die of hunger.
- Me too.

764
00:54:20,186 --> 00:54:22,608
- Do you want some?
- No, I don't.

765
00:54:22,608 --> 00:54:25,213
Your best friend bought it.

766
00:54:25,818 --> 00:54:28,827
He bought it for you, not for me.

767
00:54:28,827 --> 00:54:31,376
- It's not mine.
- No need to nitpick.

768
00:54:40,835 --> 00:54:42,938
I feel so much better now.

769
00:54:50,126 --> 00:54:52,286
This day feels so long.

770
00:54:52,876 --> 00:54:55,844
This is the longest night of my life too.

771
00:54:59,516 --> 00:55:01,681
What's with that sucking sound?

772
00:55:08,623 --> 00:55:09,672
That was good.

773
00:55:10,804 --> 00:55:12,505
Don't turn your back on me.

774
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:16,117
Face me.

775
00:55:20,865 --> 00:55:24,186
Then, face me and lie down too.

776
00:55:24,186 --> 00:55:25,525
I don't need to.

777
00:55:26,545 --> 00:55:29,476
I'm afraid you'll have
farts left over too.

778
00:55:42,407 --> 00:55:44,590
- Reporter.
- What?

779
00:55:47,047 --> 00:55:48,210
It's nothing.

780
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,210
Just say it. What is it?

781
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:54,329
About your friend...

782
00:55:56,181 --> 00:55:57,389
Jung Won?

783
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:05,480
Is he a player?

784
00:56:10,438 --> 00:56:12,260
Does he have a girlfriend?

785
00:56:17,268 --> 00:56:19,072
Huh? Does he?

786
00:56:19,072 --> 00:56:20,603
I don't really know.

787
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,282
Ask him yourself. Don't ask me.

788
00:56:38,677 --> 00:56:40,358
I've become curious about him.

789
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:49,467
You still like me though.

790
00:56:49,467 --> 00:56:51,588
Don't bother my friend.

791
00:56:54,047 --> 00:56:58,128
You're pretending to be over me
by being curious about my friend.

792
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:11,635
I'm really not.

793
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,369
Sleep well.

794
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:18,333
Don't try so hard. Don't pretend.

795
00:57:20,014 --> 00:57:21,695
Just forget me naturally.

796
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:25,849
You were in love with me for three years.

797
00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:30,322
How could you... forget me so easily?

798
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:52,000
