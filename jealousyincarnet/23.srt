00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,090
<font color="yellow">It's fine. It's not a huge injury.</font>

150
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,780
<font color="yellow">Hey, let me see.
Give me your hand.</font>

153
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:08,590
<font color="yellow">Let's break up!
Let's break up, please!</font>

154
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,390
<font color="yellow">You selfish bastard.</font>

155
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,680
<font color="yellow">You're so selfish.</font>

156
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,890
<font color="yellow">Oh, fancy seeing you here!</font>

157
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,680
<font color="yellow">I was just about to call
you into my office.</font>

158
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,350
<font color="yellow">You're being sent to Kenya as
an overseas correspondent.</font>

159
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,910
<font color="yellow">What? Director!</font>

160
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,990
<font color="yellow">Stop complaining. You have
to go if your company tells you to.</font>

161
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,800
<font color="yellow">Hey, you'll get to drink all the
Kenyan AA coffee you want.</font>

162
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,010
<font color="yellow">- You'll be gone for two years.
- Director, please!</font>

163
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,090
<font color="yellow">Oh, damn it!</font>

164
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,180
<font color="yellow">There's plenty of good coffee
here in Korea, too!</font>

165
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,780
<font color="yellow">Stop staring at my chest.
It's mine, not yours.</font>

166
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,180
<font color="yellow">Really? Then... are you okay?</font>

167
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,390
<font color="yellow">It's not on that side.</font>

168
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,280
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

169
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,660
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

170
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,890
<font color="yellow">You seem fine to me,
seeing as you're fighting back.</font>

171
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,050
<font color="yellow">I heard you asked the director
to give you a warning.</font>

172
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,490
<font color="yellow">You wanted a warning and
to step down from being an anchor.</font>

173
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,490
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

174
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,930
<font color="yellow">You don't know how many viewers posted
comments on the station's online forum</font>

175
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,090
<font color="yellow">and called the station
asking about you, do you?</font>

176
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,780
<font color="yellow">They weren't asking
about you out of curiosity</font>

177
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,450
<font color="yellow">and they weren't waiting for your
comeback out of pity, either.</font>

178
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,680
<font color="yellow">They just want to see you
on that time slot every day.</font>

179
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,680
<font color="yellow">They asked where you went,
and whether or not you got fired.</font>

<font color="yellow">And there are tons of
complaint calls coming in now, too.</font>

<font color="yellow">On top of that, there's also your
unwavering love for Pyo Na Ri.</font>

182
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,390
<font color="yellow">They want to see you sit there and
see that you're overcoming this well</font>

183
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,780
<font color="yellow">and see that you're healthy
every single day.</font>

184
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,620
<font color="yellow">So did you really have to run away,
like some kid going through puberty?</font>

185
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,720
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know.</font>

186
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,280
<font color="yellow">Everyone is talking about you two!</font>

187
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,590
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see the banner that they
hung up, as per the president's orders?</font>

188
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:11,180

all you have for the time being.</font>

189
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,590
<font color="yellow">I'm going to give up on you now, Senior.</font>

190
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,320
<font color="yellow">It's over.</font>

191
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,590
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to like you anymore.</font>

192
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,390
<font color="yellow">Did you find a better guy than me?</font>

193
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,880
<font color="yellow">I still think your chest is sexy...</font>

194
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,180
<font color="yellow">and I want to work with you
for a long time.</font>

195
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,890

<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

238
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,990
<font color="yellow">Should we just have dinner on
the day he finishes his exam?</font>

239
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,590
<font color="yellow">What, are you scared of
Chi Yeol or something?</font>

240
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,180
<font color="yellow">But you know, Beom is your

<font color="yellow">Let's break up.</font>

244
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,790
<font color="yellow">Is it because you're scared of your
younger brothers-in-law? Huh?</font>

245
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:55,090
<font color="yellow">What? Is it because
you're infertile now?</font>

246
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,590
<font color="yellow">Is that why?</font>

247
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,290
<font color="yellow">You knew?</font>

248
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,790
<font color="yellow">Since when have you known?</font>

249
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,240
<font color="yellow">Did you play dumb and toy with me
in the palm of your hand?</font>

250
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,480
<font color="yellow">You were just observing, is that it?</font>

251
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,980
<font color="yellow">I found out a bit after you disappeared.</font>

252
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,090
<font color="yellow">Slow down!</font>

253
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,290
<font color="yellow">Leave me alone.</font>

254
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,180
<font color="yellow">I bet you thought that I was so pathetic.</font>

255
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,090
<font color="yellow">Good, then.
Let's break up.</font>

256
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:52,290
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

257
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,390
<font color="yellow">Let's end this.</font>

258
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,790
<font color="yellow">I'm fine with us never
being able to have children.</font>

259
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,180
<font color="yellow">It's really okay.</font>

260
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,180
<font color="yellow">All I need is you.</font>

261
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,150
<font color="yellow">I don't have any confidence that I'd be
good at raising a child anyway, and...</font>

262
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,790
<font color="yellow">Wow, you sure are great at lying.</font>

263
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,400
<font color="yellow">I'm not lying.
I'm really okay with it.</font>

264
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,600
<font color="yellow">You sure know how to make someone seem
really pathetic in a matter of seconds.</font>

265
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,890
<font color="yellow">Did you pity me?</font>

266
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,590
<font color="yellow">- Don't be sorry.
- Did you pity me?</font>

267
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,180
<font color="yellow">Is that why you just stood by and
watched without saying anything?</font>

268
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,390
<font color="yellow">I wanted to give you time.</font>

269
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,180
<font color="yellow">I thought that you'd tell me about it
when you were comfortable doing so.</font>

270
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,090
<font color="yellow">So I just waited.</font>

271
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,290
<font color="yellow">I'm fine with never having a child,
but I can't live without you.</font>

272
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,590
<font color="yellow">I can't break up with you.</font>

273
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,980
<font color="yellow">But I'm not okay with it!</font>

274
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,180
<font color="yellow">This isn't an issue we can solve
just by having you be okay with it.</font>

275
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,240
<font color="yellow">It doesn't automatically make me feel
better just because you're okay with it.</font>

276
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,890
<font color="yellow">You know that?</font>

277
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,590
<font color="yellow">I'm totally confident
that I'll love you forever.</font>

278
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,890
<font color="yellow">But I've questioned myself
thousands of times...</font>

279
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:20,390
<font color="yellow">about whether or not I can
make you happy forever.</font>

280
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,980
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

281

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,040
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't get caught up in it,
and leave him alone.</i></font>

295
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,590
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that he'll be able to
overcome this internal struggle of his.</font>

296
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,090
<font color="yellow">Oh, hey.</font>

297
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,390
<font color="yellow">There's been a problem
with my family in England.</font>

298
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,780
<font color="yellow">I have to go to England,
for just a week.</font>

299
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,180
<font color="yellow">What about the 9 p.m. news, then?</font>

300
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,640
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

301
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,590
<font color="yellow">Do I have to push through
and keep working</font>

302
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,840
<font color="yellow">despite my mom
being in critical condition</font>

303
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,480
<font color="yellow">just because of the nature of my job?</font>

304
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,130
<font color="yellow">If I'm not with my mother
in her final moments</font>

305
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,010
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'll ever
be able to eat again.</font>

306
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,590
<font color="yellow">I mean, how could I eat if
I did such an inhumane thing?</font>

307
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,980
<font color="yellow">Your mother is in critical condition?</font>

308
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,980
<font color="yellow">Oh, man.</font>

309
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,790
<font color="yellow">Hey, can't we just have Hwa Shin
fill in for me? Just for a week.</font>

310
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,790
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin?</font>

311
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,680
<font color="yellow">Hey, you could end up
losing that spot to Hwa Shin.</font>

312
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,180
<font color="yellow">Who knows what might happen?</font>

313
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,080
<font color="yellow">Do you think that the president
will let you on that slot</font>

314
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,090
<font color="yellow">if Hwa Shin gets popular?</font>

315
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,300
<font color="yellow">Please, help me.</font>

316
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,390
<font color="yellow">This is driving me insane...</font>

317
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,980
<font color="yellow">Tell this to the president
yourself, then.</font>

318
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,890
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir. What?</font>

319
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,390
<font color="yellow">With Pyo Na Ri?</font>

320
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,090
<font color="yellow">Um, sir. I...</font>

321
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,680
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes.
Yes, I understand, but...</font>

322
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,180
<font color="yellow">But this is too soon for her.
It'd be better for us to be cautious.</font>

323
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,480
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm completely opposed to
having them do the 9 p.m. news together.</font>

324
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,590
<font color="yellow">Think about this if it were
the other way around.</font>

325
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,180
<font color="yellow">Would you want to break up with me
if I couldn't get pregnant?</font>

326
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,590
<font color="yellow">- Would you?
- Go away.</font>

327
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:29,480
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I can imagine what
it'd be like to be married with no kids.</font>

328
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,180
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it'd get tedious after
a while if it were just the two of us.</font>

329
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,680
<font color="yellow">It'd be nice if we could cheer up while
looking at our child, who looks like us.</font>

330
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,890
<font color="yellow">We'd be able to resolve our arguments
right away for the sake of the child.</font>

331
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,650
<font color="yellow">And the child would
probably make us happy.</font>

332
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,470
<font color="yellow">And worried sometimes, too.
But we'd get through it together.</font>

333
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,640
<font color="yellow">Good, then.</font>

334
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,180
<font color="yellow">But I can't even imagine being
married to someone other than you.</font>

335
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,890
<font color="yellow">After you disappeared,
I realized that</font>

336
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,090
<font color="yellow">not being able to have kids
pales in comparison</font>

337
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,590
<font color="yellow">to not having you around at all.</font>

338
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,390
<font color="yellow">Because you weren't by my side,
I came to realize that</font>

339
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,590
<font color="yellow">I won't wish for anything else,
as long as you're by my side.</font>

340
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,790
<font color="yellow">So, please.</font>

341
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:13,390
<font color="yellow">If you don't hate me and you
haven't gotten sick of me already</font>

342
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,680
<font color="yellow">don't say things like
"Let's break up."</font>

343
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,090
<font color="yellow">If you say that one more time, I...</font>

344
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,790
<font color="yellow">Let's break up.</font>

345
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,680
<font color="yellow">Let's break up.</font>

346
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,090
<font color="yellow">How can you be so cold?</font>

347
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,090
<font color="yellow">Let's break up.</font>

348
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,090
<font color="yellow">- Shut your mouth, right now.
- Let's break up.</font>

349
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,590
<font color="yellow">I'm going to stitch
your nasty mouth shut.</font>

350
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,180
<font color="yellow">I said, let's break up.</font>

351
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,890
<font color="yellow">How can it be that easy for you
to say something like that?</font>

352
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,480
<font color="yellow">It's very easy for me to say
things like that. Let's break up.</font>

353
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,590
<font color="yellow">You're such a terrible person.</font>

354
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,390
<font color="yellow">Let's break up.</font>

355
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,590
<font color="yellow">It's just infertility.</font>

356
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,980
<font color="yellow">There isn't anything that's
100 percent impossible these days</font>

357
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,090
<font color="yellow">due to all the medical breakthroughs.</font>

358
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,390
<font color="yellow">We can just try every day.</font>

359
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,590
<font color="yellow">Let's just have sex
every hour of every day.</font>

360
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,560
<font color="yellow">And eat things that are good
for you before doing it.</font>

361
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,530
<font color="yellow">Let's get you in shape,
and sleep together.</font>

362
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:09,180
<font color="yellow">No pressure. Just think of it
as a super passionate nap.</font>

363
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,480
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

364
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,210
<font color="yellow">It's completely possible,
just as long as we don't give up.</font>

365
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,210
<font color="yellow">Please?</font>

366
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,890
<font color="yellow">You want to just have sex every day?</font>

367
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,480
<font color="yellow">Let's do our best.</font>

368
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,890
<font color="yellow">This is so pathetic.</font>

369
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,480
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up and go home.
- I'll be good to you.</font>

370
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,680
<font color="yellow">What if you still can't get
pregnant, despite all that?</font>

371
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,920
<font color="yellow">Say that after you've slept
with me at least 100 times.</font>

372
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
<font color="yellow">And after that?</font>

373
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,790
<font color="yellow">Then... let's take a hot, passionate nap
every time you eat ramen at my house.</font>

374
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,500
<font color="yellow">And what if you still don't
get pregnant after that?</font>

375
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,090
<font color="yellow">We can just buy more ramen.</font>

376
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,390
<font color="yellow">Don't look at me like that.</font>

377
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,980
<font color="yellow">I won't marry you.</font>

378
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,090
<font color="yellow">Do you even know how much
ramen is at your house?</font>

379
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,320
<font color="yellow">It's less than a thousand.</font>

380
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,890
<font color="yellow">I won't marry you.</font>

381
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,590
<font color="yellow">Marry me.</font>

382
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,790
<font color="yellow">Let's break up.</font>

383
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,790
<font color="yellow">Let's break up!</font>

384
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,090
<font color="yellow">Leave.</font>

385
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,390
<font color="yellow">Did you just dump me?</font>

386
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,890
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

387
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,790
<font color="yellow">Did I just get dumped?</font>

388
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,790
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

389
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,090
<font color="yellow">You won't regret this, right?</font>

390
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,090
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

391
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,890
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's end things, then.</font>

392
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,480
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Let's just break up.
Let's break up.</font>

393
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,680
<font color="yellow">Let's break up.</font>

394
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,030
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and go back home!</font>

395
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,680
<font color="yellow">Oh, whatever.</font>

396
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,090
<font color="yellow">Wow, you sure are great, huh?</font>

397
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,980
<font color="yellow">Your pride is really amazing.</font>

398
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,090
<font color="yellow">You really are more stubborn
than anyone I know.</font>

399
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,190
<font color="yellow">Good for you.</font>

400
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,580
<font color="yellow">I honestly did all that I could.</font>

401
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,190
<font color="yellow">Don't be disappointed in me.</font>

402
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,580
<font color="yellow">I tried as best as I could already.</font>

403
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,990
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare say that you're
disappointed or whatever later.</font>

404
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,190
<font color="yellow">And don't curse me, either!</font>

405
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,790
<font color="yellow">Yeah, whatever.
Let's just give up.</font>

406
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,490
<font color="yellow">- Go home.
- Let's just give up!</font>

407
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,380
<font color="yellow">- You'll freeze to death.
- Forget about it all!</font>

408
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,490
<font color="yellow">Damn it!</font>

409
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,380
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee, do you want
to have one last ramen?</font>

410
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,140
<font color="yellow">- One last one?
- Yeah.</font>

411
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,790
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

412
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,900
<font color="yellow">No to what? It being the last time?
Ramen? "Napping"?</font>

413
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,220
<font color="yellow">Yeah, whatever.
Let's just give up.</font>

414
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,790
<font color="yellow">Let's just give up. Give up!
Just give up on all of it!</font>

415
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,790
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and leave!</font>

416
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,190
<font color="yellow">We broke up anyway,
so don't worry and just sleep.</font>

417
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,790
<font color="yellow">Na Ri.</font>

418
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,880
<font color="yellow">What are you doing over there?</font>

419
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,690
<font color="yellow">You saw, right? Your sister got drunk
and is clinging to me, acting absurd.</font>

420
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,190
<font color="yellow">Clean her off my property.</font>

421
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:12,790
<font color="yellow">What did you say?
How dare you say that about a woman?</font>

422
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,170
<font color="yellow">- Huh?
- Hey!</font>

423
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,290
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and get over here!</font>

425
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,520
<font color="yellow">Are you two heading to work?</font>

426
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,290
<font color="yellow">Are you... going somewhere?</font>

427
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,190
<font color="yellow">Yes. I have some business
to attend to, you see.</font>

428
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,710
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. See you
later tonight, at the hotel.</font>

429
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,490
<font color="yellow">Oh... yes.</font>

430
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,990
<font color="yellow">What are you doing at the hotel?</font>

431
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,020
<font color="yellow">I'll have to head there to find out.</font>

432
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,990
<font color="yellow">You two are going to
hotels together already?</font>

433
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,490
<font color="yellow">Make sure you don't bring that up.</font>

434
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,590
<font color="yellow">All you have to do is
keep your own mouth shut.</font>

435
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,190
<font color="yellow">You'll have to eat dinner alone.</font>

436
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,990
<font color="yellow">I figured as much and made the
cod stew you like. It's in the fridge.</font>

437
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:24,890
<font color="yellow">Don't just eat whatever because
you're alone. Eat a proper meal.</font>

438
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:25,900
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

439
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,390
<font color="yellow">Heat it up before you eat it, okay?</font>

440
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,890
<font color="yellow">You do know how to heat food up, right?</font>

441
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,090
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

442
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,590
<font color="yellow">I don't like the fact that you're dating.</font>

443
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,990
<font color="yellow">I'm bored.</font>

444
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,490
<font color="yellow">It feels like Chef is stealing you away!</font>

445
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,910
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you being
serious right now?</font>

446
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:46,510
<font color="yellow">I won't heat it up and eat it!
I don't know how to! I'm not eating it!</font>

447
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,190
<font color="yellow">How could you change so much?</font>

448
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,640
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's been like 500
years since I last dated.</font>

449
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,490
<font color="yellow">Can't you help me out?</font>

450
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,490
<font color="yellow">All right, Hwa Shin, Pyo Na Ri.</font>

451
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,990
<font color="yellow">You two are doing the 9 p.m. news.</font>

452
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,790
<font color="yellow">Why? I don't want to do it with her.</font>

453
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,040
<font color="yellow">It's the president's orders.
Just try your best for just a week.</font>

454
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,490
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Reporter Kye
won't stand for this.</font>

455
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,090
<font color="yellow">The president said that we
should have both of you fill in</font>

456
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,350
<font color="yellow">since you're filling in anyway.</font>

457
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:15,780
<font color="yellow">You two are being talked about as of
late anyway, so it may boost our ratings.</font>

458
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,990
<font color="yellow">- Happy now? Do I keep going?
- No.</font>

459
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,830
<font color="yellow">This isn't a request.
It's an order, punk.</font>

460
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,390
<font color="yellow">How are you so damn self-centered?</font>

461
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,780
<font color="yellow">This is a great chance for Pyo Na Ri.</font>

462
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,290
<font color="yellow">She'll be able to improve her image
after what happened with the election.</font>

463
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,790
<font color="yellow">And Reporter Kye said that
she'd never work with you.</font>

464
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,290
<font color="yellow">She said she's taking a week off.</font>

465
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,890
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best, sir.
Thank you for this opportunity.</font>

466
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,490
<font color="yellow">I told you I can't, Chief.</font>

467
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,890
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

468
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,390
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to
get married, at this rate.</font>

469
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,390
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

470
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,490
<font color="yellow">If you do the 9 p.m. news with me</font>

471
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,190
<font color="yellow">people who were unaware of
our relationship will soon find out</font>

472
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,790
<font color="yellow">and it won't benefit you in any way.</font>

473
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,090
<font color="yellow">The broadcasting company
is just using us.</font>

474
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,290
<font color="yellow">To get more views.</font>

475
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,090
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's not that
you're not confident that I can do it</font>

476
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,300
<font color="yellow">even though it's only a week?</font>

477
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,090
<font color="yellow">I'm going to adhere to my beliefs
and do well, even if it's only a week.</font>

478
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,220
<font color="yellow">Sure you will.</font>

479
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,690
<font color="yellow">You're not ready for this yet.</font>

480
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,090
<font color="yellow">If you stand in the spotlight,
you'll be attacked more, too.</font>

481
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,490
<font color="yellow">It could become dangerous for you.</font>

482
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,760
<font color="yellow">I've never once worked
in a safe environment</font>

483
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,660
<font color="yellow">so maybe that's why it doesn't
really scare me when you say that.</font>

484
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,160
<font color="yellow">- I'm not kidding.
- Neither am I.</font>

485
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
<font color="yellow">We broke up.</font>

486
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,640
<font color="yellow">You said we shouldn't get married,
pretending it was for my own good</font>

487
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,990
<font color="yellow">and now you're doing the same thing
with the new anchor position?</font>

488
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:20,630
<font color="yellow">Why did you become such a scaredy-cat?
Why did you become so spineless?</font>

489
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,490
<font color="yellow">Don't forget that I have breast cancer
and that I'm infertile.</font>

490
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:27,090
<font color="yellow">Are you an idiot? Reconsider.</font>

491
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,190
<font color="yellow">Why did you become such a scaredy-cat?
Why did you become so spineless?</font>

492
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,860
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't ever be someone's replacement.</font>

493
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,620
<font color="yellow">You know that I'm doing
the morning news, right?</font>

494
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:47,480
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to get that slot back,
because I won't give it back.</font>

495
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,490
<font color="yellow">Do your best.</font>

496
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,890
<font color="yellow">Thanks, all of you.</font>

497
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,890
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting so pitiful?
It's not like you.</font>

498
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:02,390
<font color="yellow">Do you know why I said
I wouldn't do the 9 p.m. news?</font>

499
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,140
<font color="yellow">You met me when I was in high school</font>

500
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,290
<font color="yellow">so I'm forever a
high-schooler in your mind.</font>

501
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,490
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

502
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,090
<font color="yellow">How could I do the 9 p.m. news
with a high-schooler?</font>

503
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,010
<font color="yellow">Straighten up.</font>

504
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,290
<font color="yellow">Do you think that I'm not
aware of what you're thinking?</font>

505
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,690
<font color="yellow">You're not planning to
fill in only for a week.</font>

506
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:24,490
<font color="yellow">You want to keep this spot, don't you?</font>

507
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,890
<font color="yellow">You think this may be an opportunity.</font>

508
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,290
<font color="yellow">Isn't that obvious?</font>

509
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,690
<font color="yellow">Stars are usually born
through chances like these.</font>

510
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,010
<font color="yellow">Oh, don't worry.</font>

511
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,290
<font color="yellow">My big sister can't win against me.</font>

512
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,190
<font color="yellow">Um, I'm going to head
to the bathroom for a bit.</font>

513
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. Go ahead.</font>

514
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,900
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

515
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,790
<font color="yellow">This is your first time,
so be alert.</font>

516
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,490
<font color="yellow"><i>10 seconds!</i></font>

517
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:27,990

518
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,090

<font color="yellow">I'm Pyo Na Ri.</font>

522
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,420
<font color="yellow">- Wow, they're on fire.
- Yeah... okay.</font>

523
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:50,570
<font color="yellow">What kind of woman is she that
she cured you of your asexuality?</font>

524
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,090
<font color="yellow">I was so curious to know that I ran here!</font>

525
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,090
<font color="yellow">And she's young too, I presume?</font>

526
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,790
<font color="yellow">She is.</font>

527
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,090
<font color="yellow">Younger than you, at least.</font>

528
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,990
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

529
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,490
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

530
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:10,390
<font color="yellow">Hey, Bang Ja Young!
What brings you here?</font>

531
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,390
<font color="yellow">Say hello, Big Sis.</font>

532
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,990
<font color="yellow">This woman, to me, is the
sexiest woman in the whole world.</font>

533
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,030
<font color="yellow">It has been decided that
ex-Chairman Kang Yong Jae of D Group</font>

534
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,320
<font color="yellow">who evaded taxes and fines
and is being held at his workplace</font>

535
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,490

<font color="yellow"><i>for every seven hour workday.</i></font>

538
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,790
<font color="yellow">- It's quite...
- Could he be mining diamonds there?</font>

539
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,790
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, Hwa Shin!</i></font>

540
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,690
<font color="yellow">That punk! What else is
he adding on, now?</font>

541
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,690
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop it!</font>

542
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,090
<font color="yellow">And days such as weekends, days off,
and national holidays will all count.</font>

543
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:50,350
<font color="yellow"><i>One may think that the deal he
got may be too good to be true...</i></font>

544

Hurry and cut in!</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>The average rate one receives for working
off their fine is 100,000 won per day</i></font>

546

<font color="yellow"><i>so it'd take one over 100 years to
work off 3.8 billion won in fines.</i></font>

547
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:03,090
<font color="yellow">He should be considerate of the
hardworking citizens of this country</font>

548
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,490
<font color="yellow">- and ex-Chairman Kang should...
<i>- Hey, don't do it!</i></font>

549
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,490
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you crazy?
Why are you doing this?</i></font>

550
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,230
<font color="yellow">He should make an exception for his own
department store's shopping bags, right?</font>

551
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,010
<font color="yellow">All right, that is all.
That's the end of SBC News Hot Nine.</font>

552
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,320
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to do
this when I'm the PD?</font>

553
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,990
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to insult someone
on live TV when I'm the PD, you bastard?</font>

554
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,790
<font color="yellow"><i>Please have a good night.</i></font>

555
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,690
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

556
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,390
<font color="yellow">You still think I'm a coward?</font>

557
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,190
<font color="yellow">You think I'm just pretending?</font>

558
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:35,490
<font color="yellow">Hey, it was nice,
but take it down a notch.</font>

559
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:39,190
<font color="yellow">Acting like this can
end up backfiring on you.</font>

560
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:43,590
<font color="yellow">Hey, what if D Group's department
store says they'll pull all their ads?</font>

561
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,520
<font color="yellow">Why are you trying to get
yourself fired on the first day?</font>

562
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,060
<font color="yellow">I'll just fold shopping bags like
that chairman if I get fired.</font>

563
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,790
<font color="yellow">Oh, whatever.
Great freaking job!</font>

564
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,990
<font color="yellow">This is a brand new blanket.</font>

565
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,490
<font color="yellow">Yes, but you should wash a
blanket once before using it.</font>

566
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,390
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye!
- Bye, now!</font>

567
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,390
<font color="yellow">Why are you following me?</font>

568
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,190
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's here.</font>

569
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,690
<font color="yellow">What is all this?</font>

570
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,890
<font color="yellow">This is the rice cooker that
we picked out together.</font>

571
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:30,190
<font color="yellow">And this is an iron for me
to iron your shirts with.</font>

572
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,990
<font color="yellow">And this is a blanket for us.</font>

573
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,030
<font color="yellow">I just bought it, but had it washed
so we can use it right away.</font>

574
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,490
<font color="yellow">Like, immediately.</font>

575
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,890
<font color="yellow">I thought you said that you'd
give up on our relationship.</font>

576
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,890
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

577
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,700
<font color="yellow">Wasn't that rice cooker for you to use?</font>

578
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,990
<font color="yellow">No. The lid on the rice
cooker at my place is loose</font>

579
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,090
<font color="yellow">but my mom used to use it,
so I can never throw it away.</font>

580
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,190
<font color="yellow">I'll probably use it for about
10 more years or so.</font>

581
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,370
<font color="yellow">Let's break up.</font>

582
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,090
<font color="yellow">You don't have any of
these things, anyway.</font>

583
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:00,360
<font color="yellow">You moved in here without
even bringing a winter blanket.</font>

584
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,790
<font color="yellow">Let's use it together
while we live together.</font>

585
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,070
<font color="yellow">These are the only furnishings
I'm bringing into our marriage</font>

586
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,590
<font color="yellow">so don't ask for any
more stuff from me.</font>

587
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,590
<font color="yellow">I'm not marrying you.</font>

588
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,690
<font color="yellow">You won't?</font>

589
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,090
<font color="yellow">All right, then.
Forget about it.</font>

590
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,490
<font color="yellow">Bye, then.</font>

591
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,390
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do with all this?</font>

592
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,690
<font color="yellow">I'm saying that I'll make you rice
with this, iron your shirt with this</font>

593
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,250
<font color="yellow">and take nice, long "naps"
with you under this!</font>

594
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,590
<font color="yellow">Why are you so clingy?</font>

595
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,890
<font color="yellow">I had one-sided feelings
for you for three years.</font>

596
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,690
<font color="yellow">Then we started liking each other,
and were even about to get married.</font>

597
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,090
<font color="yellow">Then I just received word from
you that you want to break up.</font>

598
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,890
<font color="yellow">So I think it'll take a good 30 years
before I can break up with you.</font>

599
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,990
<font color="yellow">I'll break up with you
after 30 years. Okay?</font>

600
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:49,190
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting so foolishly?</font>

601
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,990
<font color="yellow">Booyoo Group's Chairman Choi Jang Go
has been fined 170 billion won</font>

special economic crime law</i></font>

604
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,990

605
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,180

cited financial losses</i></font>

606

<font color="yellow">as a reason for firing full-time workers
and hiring only contracted workers.</font>

607
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,690

- Booyoo Group's slogan is</font>

alongside the nation"</font>

609

<font color="yellow">Hey, stop! Stop!</font>

612
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:32,190
<font color="yellow">But the truth is that Chairman Choi
was more interested in enriching himself.</font>

613
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,690
<font color="yellow">That'll be all for the News Hot Nine.</font>

without letting me know?</font>

618
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,290
<font color="yellow">Give me a signal or something. I'm going
to die of a heart attack because of you.</font>

619
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,490
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's not out of the ordinary for
big companies to embezzle money.</font>

620
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,560
<font color="yellow">I told you right before we
started the news, didn't I?</font>

621
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,090
<font color="yellow">You were to speak of Chairman Choi as
drily as possible and state only facts!</font>

622
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,520
<font color="yellow">Drily?</font>

623
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,790
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm a dryer, or something?
You don't think I have emotions?</font>

624
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,290
<font color="yellow">You think I'm a robot?</font>

625
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,630

off the prompter like a parrot?</font>

626
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,790
<font color="yellow">You said that we could make the
concluding statements as we wished!</font>

627
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:33,490
<font color="yellow">I can't just talk about
Chairman Choi like a dryer or a robot</font>

628
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,780
<font color="yellow">so how can I only stick
to delivering the facts?</font>

629
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,000
<font color="yellow">You didn't put me here to
do just that. Am I wrong?</font>

630
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,090

631
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,090

don't make any snide remarks!</font>

will be ripped out at this rate.</font>

that to happen?</font>

634
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,290

better to say those things?</font>

635
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,030
<font color="yellow">You think that'll help us
raise our ratings?</font>

723
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:16,390
<font color="yellow">Looks like you don't want
to hear that from me</font>

724
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,880
<font color="yellow">even though you wanted to break up.</font>

725
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:26,880
<font color="yellow">Here, have a snack, too.</font>

726
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,290
<font color="yellow">I hate anchovies more than
any other snack in the world.</font>

727
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:35,490
<font color="yellow">Eat it anyway.
It's good for your chest.</font>

728
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,490
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

729
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:41,890
<font color="yellow">Wow, you really don't listen!</font>

730
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:43,890
<font color="yellow">Why should I listen to you
when I don't even listen to my mom?</font>

731
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:46,720
<font color="yellow">Listen to your mom, and listen
to me too from now on, then!</font>

732
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,890
<font color="yellow">- What?
- And also, when we're doing the news!</font>

733
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:53,790
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep interrupting me
whenever I say something off-script?</font>

734
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,490
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much you
surprise me whenever you do that?</font>

735
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:58,790
<font color="yellow">- That's...
- Are you a reckless driver?</font>

736
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:59,940
<font color="yellow">Or are you a new driver?</font>

737
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,090
<font color="yellow">You're obviously the new one,
so I'm the reckless one.</font>

738
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:04,190
<font color="yellow">Either way, they're both dangerous!</font>

739
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:08,490
<font color="yellow">Reckless drivers are overconfident
and get into huge accidents.</font>

740
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:09,990
<font color="yellow">A new driver is better.</font>

741
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:13,160
<font color="yellow">At least they're really careful, so they
don't get into any big accidents.</font>

742
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,490
<font color="yellow">In this way, you're even
worse than Reporter Park!</font>

743
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:18,790
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

744
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,290
<font color="yellow">How could you possibly
compare me to that punk?</font>

745
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:23,680
<font color="yellow">What? I'm worse than him?</font>

746
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,490
<font color="yellow">How, exactly? Tell me.
Stop being ridiculous!</font>

747
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:29,470
<font color="yellow">Reporter Park may ignore his partner</font>

748
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:34,190
<font color="yellow">but he's never
interrupted me like you do.</font>

749
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:37,310
<font color="yellow">Honestly, when I go on air with you,
I feel like my heart is going to drop</font>

750
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,190
<font color="yellow">and I get so nervous that I feel like
I'm going to have a heart attack!</font>

751
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,290
<font color="yellow">That's why I told you not
to do it from the start!</font>

752
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:45,790
<font color="yellow">I thought you couldn't handle it,
which is why I told you not to do it!</font>

753
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,090
<font color="yellow">Why should I?</font>

754
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,990
<font color="yellow">You're the one who should think of
cooperating better with your partner!</font>

755
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,590
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Are you a dictator?</font>

756
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,390
<font color="yellow">- Shut your mouth.
- Are you a tyrant?</font>

757
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:55,690
<font color="yellow">I told you to shut it!</font>

758
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,590
<font color="yellow">You think it's cool to
be a reckless driver?</font>

It's Chi Yeol!</font>

761
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:12,490
<font color="yellow">You're scared of him, right?
Hurry and hide!</font>

762
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:14,690
<font color="yellow">- Hurry! It's Chi Yeol!
- Why should I?</font>

763

00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,690

780
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,690
<font color="yellow">Why did you kiss me before?</font>

781
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,890
<font color="yellow">Because you were
driving me crazy, so...</font>

782

787
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:17,190

788
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,290

that we'll never have a kid?</font>

Can you help me with this?</font>
