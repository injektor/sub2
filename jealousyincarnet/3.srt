- A bit closer.</font>

340
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,620
<font color="yellow">It'll hurt a little.</font>

341
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,190
<font color="yellow">The more it hurts, the firmer your chest is.</font>

342
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,850
<font color="yellow">It means your body is young.</font>

343

<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

346
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,020
<font color="yellow">A little bit more.</font>

347
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,150
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

348
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:06,250
<font color="yellow">It's nothing compared to giving birth.</font>

349
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,290
<font color="yellow">Keep breathing.</font>

350
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,320
<font color="yellow">How could I breathe?</font>

351
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,490
<font color="yellow">Hold your breath.</font>

352
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,990
<font color="yellow">Did he get a check-up?</font>

353
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,720
<font color="yellow">- I guess.
- Goodness.</font>

354
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,790
<font color="yellow">Why is he here?</font>

355
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,890

357
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,390
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

358
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,720
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

359
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,090
<font color="yellow">Just.</font>

360
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,690

<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

362
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,850

363
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,020

364
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,990
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

365
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,390
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

366
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,350
<font color="yellow">Because I always need friends and boyfriend.</font>

367
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,120
<font color="yellow">It doesn't say it's an overseas call.</font>

368
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,390
<font color="yellow">Are you in Korea?</font>

369
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,720

378
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,990
<font color="yellow">Do you want to sleep here?</font>

379
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,250
<font color="yellow">I should go home.</font>

380
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,650
<font color="yellow">You can sleep here.</font>

381
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,990
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time. You haven't started working yet.</font>

- Yes.</font>

387

<font color="yellow">Do you remember Soo Young? She's getting married.</font>

388
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,250
<font color="yellow">The girl who used to like me.</font>

389
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,820
<font color="yellow">- Do you mean Oh Soo Young?
- Yes.</font>

390
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,950
<font color="yellow">She didn't like you.</font>

391
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,120
<font color="yellow">She followed me around everywhere.</font>

392
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,350
<font color="yellow">You're kidding me.</font>

393
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,490
<font color="yellow">My first kiss was with her.</font>

394

395
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,920

396
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,090

<font color="yellow">What a brave girl!</font>

398
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,820
<font color="yellow">She treated us...</font>

399
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,420
<font color="yellow">like we were a half-and-half fried chicken set.</font>

400
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,350

- You, of course.</font>

<font color="yellow">You're covered with money.</font>

402
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,650
<font color="yellow">What would you be, then?</font>

403
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,790
<font color="yellow">I'd be the plain fried chicken that's tasty as it is.</font>

404
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,250
<font color="yellow">That's absurd.</font>

405
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,990

406
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,520
<font color="yellow">Should we ask her on her wedding day?</font>
