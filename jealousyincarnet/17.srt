1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,610
<font color="yellow">Should the three of us
just live together like this?</font>

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,280
<font color="yellow">You don't have to if you don't want to.</font>

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,870
<font color="yellow">I just thought it might be better
if we were all together.</font>

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,920
<font color="yellow">No, no. Gosh, forget it.</font>

5
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,480
<font color="yellow">Only I can initiate any touching. Okay?</font>

6
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,780
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

7
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,950
<font color="yellow">This is all for now and only I can do it.</font>

8
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,810
<font color="yellow">That will be the only
rule of living together.</font>

9
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,040
<font color="yellow">Are we pieces of wood or something?</font>

10
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,120
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who can do it?</font>

11
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,990
<font color="yellow">If you break the rule,
you have to leave.</font>

12
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,960
<font color="yellow">That person has to leave the house.</font>

13
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,720
<font color="yellow">We can live at my place.</font>

14
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,130
<font color="yellow">- You think you can do it?
- I'll have to.</font>

15
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,640
<font color="yellow">What about you, Reporter Lee?</font>

16
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,090
<font color="yellow">If I say no to this...</font>

17
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,270
<font color="yellow">you're not going to
live with him, are you?</font>

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,890
<font color="yellow"><i>There was lightning and
a torrential rainfall in Seoul...</i></font>

19
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,160
<font color="yellow">Nurse Oh, do you have any painkillers?</font>

20
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,710
<font color="yellow">Where are you hurting?</font>

21
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,020
<font color="yellow">If we really live together,
you two may end up not liking me.</font>

22
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,630
<font color="yellow">You may end up losing feelings for me
after living together for a month.</font>

23
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,730
<font color="yellow">Is she doing this to try and break up?</font>

24
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,820
<font color="yellow">Well, one person could end up
disliking me and pack up to leave.</font>

25
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,340
<font color="yellow">Or I could end up leaving.</font>

26
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,380
<font color="yellow">I think she is doing it to break up.</font>

27
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,880
<font color="yellow">How could Pyo Na Ri say
something like that? Is she crazy?</font>

28
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,000
<font color="yellow">To break up without regrets.</font>

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,200
<font color="yellow">She wants to be
done with us and break up?</font>

30
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,420
<font color="yellow">It's going to bother her
forever that we are friends.</font>

31
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,700
<font color="yellow">No matter who she chooses,
our friendship will be ruined.</font>

32
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,030
<font color="yellow">Who asks to live with someone
in order to break up? Such nonsense.</font>

33
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,940
<font color="yellow">It makes no sense for the three of us
to live together to begin with.</font>

34
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,400
<font color="yellow">What makes sense
in this situation at all?</font>

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,710
<font color="yellow">- Let's not do it.
- Let's do it.</font>

36
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,610
<font color="yellow">I can't go along with someone trying
to break up with me, and I won't.</font>

37
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,300
<font color="yellow">She won't choose either of us.</font>

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,850
<font color="yellow">She'll live with us and say
she doesn't want either of us.</font>

39
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,880
<font color="yellow">The decision is already made.</font>

40
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,840
<font color="yellow">Still, let's do it.
Let's do whatever Pyo Na Ri asks of us.</font>

41
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,270
<font color="yellow">Let's do everything she wants.</font>

42
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,390
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri started it the way she wanted,
but we can end it differently.</font>

43
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,330
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

44
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,560
<font color="yellow">Do you have indigestion?</font>

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,780
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think so.</font>

46
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,690
<font color="yellow">I suppose I ate something
I shouldn't have.</font>

47
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,450
<font color="yellow">Was it something good?</font>

48
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,630
<font color="yellow">This is the only way
to end things quickly.</font>

49
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,860
<font color="yellow">This way we can decide quickly.</font>

50
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,150
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make this work.</font>

51
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,900
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

52
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,210
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear her say
no touching is allowed?</font>

53
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,980
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry her within one month.</font>

54
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,790
<font color="yellow">I'll end it within 10 days.</font>

55
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,490
<font color="yellow">Grandma, I'm coming in.</font>

56
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,650
<font color="yellow">Grandma, how are you feeling?</font>

57
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,410
<font color="yellow">What about this arm of mine?</font>

58
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,970
<font color="yellow">How long do I have to keep my arm still
and keep it right by my body?</font>

59
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,710
<font color="yellow">Grandma, you can be discharged now.</font>

60
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,800
<font color="yellow">Don't move your arm for today.</font>

61
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,880
<font color="yellow">Starting tomorrow, you can move it a bit.</font>

62
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,470
<font color="yellow">Today...</font>

63
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,410
<font color="yellow">Today, as well?</font>

64
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:33,270
<font color="yellow">Ask Pyo Na Ri to
help you out just for today.</font>

65
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,660
<font color="yellow">Do you want to watch a movie with me?</font>

66
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,710
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

67
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,230
<font color="yellow">Why would we watch with you?</font>

68
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,990
<font color="yellow">You only have two tickets.</font>

69
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,760
<font color="yellow">Either one of you will do.</font>

70
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,390
<font color="yellow">Either one of us?</font>

71
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,590
<font color="yellow">That is the worst thing you could say.</font>

72
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,190
<font color="yellow">Don't bother if you don't want to.</font>

73
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,530
<font color="yellow">- Are you feeling lonely?
- Be quiet.</font>

74
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,650
<font color="yellow">You're lonely?</font>

75
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,210
<font color="yellow">With your wife and kids in
another country, you must be lonely.</font>

76
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,790
<font color="yellow">Get off quickly.</font>

77
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,880
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

78
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,720
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you want to
watch a movie with me?</font>

79
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,180
<font color="yellow">- What?
- It's just...</font>

80
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,880
<font color="yellow">I have tickets.</font>

81
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,970
<font color="yellow">"Darling, Will You Stay?"</font>

82
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,220
<font color="yellow">The title is a bit much.</font>

83
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,540
<font color="yellow">Why would I watch a
romance film with you?</font>

84
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,100
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee? Sorry.</font>

85
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,740
<font color="yellow">I got you discharged. We can go.</font>

86
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,070
<font color="yellow">Are you dressed?</font>

87
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,990
<font color="yellow">Isn't it hard with just one arm?</font>

88
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,660
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Don't talk to me.</font>

89
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,710
<font color="yellow">Should I help you get dressed?</font>

90
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,250
<font color="yellow">I'm putting my underwear on.</font>

91
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,340
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee, you can't use
your arm out of frustration.</font>

92
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,840
<font color="yellow">You'll have to be admitted again.</font>

93
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,770
<font color="yellow">Just take it slowly. Slowly, okay?</font>

94
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,330
<font color="yellow">- Did Jung Won leave?
- Yes.</font>

95
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,160
<font color="yellow">I really don't want the
three of us to live together.</font>

96
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,090
<font color="yellow">Is one month going to be long enough?</font>

97
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,780
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

98
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,290
<font color="yellow">I'll end it for you within 10 days.</font>

99
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,160
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

100
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,310
<font color="yellow">One for women and two for men.</font>

101
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,570
<font color="yellow">A 30 pack is enough for a month, right?</font>

102
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,450
<font color="yellow">Let's buy more.</font>

103
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,060
<font color="yellow">One is more than enough.</font>

104
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,870
<font color="yellow">Don't buy just a month's supply.</font>

105
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,000
<font color="yellow">You could end up staying
more than a month.</font>

106
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,180
<font color="yellow">Come in and stay for coffee.</font>

107
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,890
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

108
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,790
<font color="yellow">Sit down. I came knowing
you'd be here, Mom.</font>

109
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,440
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

110
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,010
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry Pyo Na Ri.</font>

111
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,100
<font color="yellow">When it comes to marriage,
I won't make any sacrifices for anyone.</font>

112
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,220
<font color="yellow">Not for you, friends, or anyone.</font>

113
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,930
<font color="yellow">Will you marry me?</font>

114
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,860
<font color="yellow">I told you I would decide
after living with you.</font>

115
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,640
<font color="yellow">It isn't right of you
to push me like this.</font>

116
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,190
<font color="yellow">Are you overconfident about
everything like this</font>

117
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,990
<font color="yellow">because you have money, or what?</font>

118
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,790
<font color="yellow">That is why I asked you
if you would marry me.</font>

119
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,250
<font color="yellow">If I were your mother,
I would be very upset too.</font>

120
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,690
<font color="yellow">And how do I come off looking?</font>

121
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,100
<font color="yellow">Were you always this way?</font>

122
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,670
<font color="yellow">You don't think about the consequences?</font>

123
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,420
<font color="yellow">You're scary when you're angry.</font>

124
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,920
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

125
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,770
<font color="yellow">You've brought out the competitive
rebel in me that had disappeared.</font>

126
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,470
<font color="yellow">That's why I like you.</font>

127
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,780
<font color="yellow">You can yell, curse, and
treat me however you want.</font>

128
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,110
<font color="yellow">Just be comfortable around me.</font>

129
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,140
<font color="yellow">Hey, move! You'll fall.</font>

130
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,220
<font color="yellow">There you go. Good job.</font>

131
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,920
<font color="yellow">This is my card. There's no limit on it.</font>

132
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,270
<font color="yellow">I want my woman to spend
the money that I've earned.</font>

133
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,980
<font color="yellow">I wanted to give it to you,
but I couldn't.</font>

134
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,690
<font color="yellow">I want to show off my money to you.</font>

135
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,220
<font color="yellow">I want to ask you why you bought a bag
at another store instead of mine.</font>

136
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,960
<font color="yellow">I want to argue with you and
tell you to stop buying new shoes.</font>

137
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,040
<font color="yellow">There's so much good food besides
black bean noodles I want you to eat.</font>

138
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,700
<font color="yellow">There is nothing better in the world
than black bean noodles.</font>

139
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,330
<font color="yellow">I have the right to know what the
woman I'm marrying spends money on.</font>

140
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,410
<font color="yellow">You can accept this card.</font>

141
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,350
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why you
never let me spend any money.</font>

142
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,430
<font color="yellow">But you like me anyway.</font>

143
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,970
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

144
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,120
<font color="yellow">Hello, there.</font>

145
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,850
<font color="yellow">Sook.</font>

146
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,730
<font color="yellow">Go see a movie with me.</font>

147
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,090
<font color="yellow">Why is everyone dying to see this movie?</font>

148
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,500
<font color="yellow">"Darling, Will You Stay?"</font>

149
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,870
<font color="yellow"><i>Sorry, Chi Yeol. I'll be staying
at the station for a while.</i></font>

150

165
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,550

aren't sweatpants kind of too much?</font>

main anchor about what I wear?</font>

196
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,030
<font color="yellow">Rumors about what?</font>

197
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,430
<font color="yellow">One woman living with two men.</font>

<font color="yellow">I can't do it and I won't.
Let's end it quickly.</font>

203
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,970

205
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,970
<font color="yellow">Here is my rent.</font>

206
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,160
<font color="yellow">It's for one month.</font>

207
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,680
<font color="yellow">There are three rooms, right?</font>

208
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,740
<font color="yellow">Since you keep insisting on it,
okay, I accept your rent.</font>

209
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,480
<font color="yellow">- What about you?
- I'll send it to your account.</font>

210
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,550
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

211
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,820
<font color="yellow">There are two rooms on the second floor</font>

212
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,890
<font color="yellow">and one on the first floor,
but it's an open space.</font>

213
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,420
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri can use a room on the second
floor and I will use the other room.</font>

214
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,430
<font color="yellow">You can have the first floor.</font>

215
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,420
<font color="yellow">You're going to be on
the second floor together?</font>

216
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,060
<font color="yellow">While I'm alone on the open first floor?</font>

217
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,310
<font color="yellow">I won't have any privacy at all and have
to eat and sleep in the common area.</font>

218
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,510
<font color="yellow">That won't do.</font>

219
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,870
<font color="yellow">You like the first floor bed
whenever you come over.</font>

220
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,270
<font color="yellow">I always sleep on the second floor.</font>

221
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,220
<font color="yellow">- It will do.
- It won't.</font>

222
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,050
<font color="yellow">- It's my house.
- Jung Won.</font>

223
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,650
<font color="yellow">This isn't a house to me,
or a even a friend's house.</font>

224
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,040
<font color="yellow">This is a war zone.</font>

225
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,270
<font color="yellow">The person who decides
who sleeps on the second floor...</font>

226
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,060
<font color="yellow">should be Pyo Na Ri.</font>

227
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,520
<font color="yellow">You're fighting even before
we have entered the house?</font>

228
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,290
<font color="yellow">How much more will you
fight once we go inside?</font>

229
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,580
<font color="yellow">So, what do you want to do?</font>

230
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,710
<font color="yellow">You should decide.</font>

231
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,450
<font color="yellow">You feeling confident?</font>

232
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,650
<font color="yellow">Of course, I am.</font>

233
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,060
<font color="yellow">My name is Soo Young.</font>

234
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,360
<font color="yellow">Soo Young?</font>

235
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,130
<font color="yellow">Soo Young?</font>

236
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,160
<font color="yellow">I'm Hye Kyo.</font>

237
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,800
<font color="yellow">Soo Young.</font>

238
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,870
<font color="yellow">Is your last name Song?</font>

239
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,780
<font color="yellow">Song Hye Kyo?</font>

240
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,840
<font color="yellow">Let's all split up and head out.</font>

241
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,270
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

242
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,750
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Let's hang out together.</font>

243
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,310
<font color="yellow">You can eat this.</font>

244
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,230
<font color="yellow">Okay, but I don't really like sweets.</font>

245
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,480
<font color="yellow"><i>Thank you to all of you for coming to

249
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,130

252
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,700
<font color="yellow"><i>You with the hat,
are you already out?</i></font>

253
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,060
<font color="yellow"><i>You should just wipe the floor
while you're there.</i></font>

254
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,360
<font color="yellow"><i>You two high school kids there.
You with the glasses.</i></font>

255
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,780
<font color="yellow"><i>What kind of relationship are you in?</i></font>

256
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,460
<font color="yellow">It's just a ride that uses
centrifugal force and gravity.</font>

257
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,230
<font color="yellow">You won't be thrown out, so don't worry.</font>

258
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,270

<font color="yellow"><i>We will get started for real now.</i></font>

262
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,690

Aren't you two minors?</i></font>

265
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,010

What are we to do with them?</i></font>

266
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,480
<font color="yellow"><i>All right, then...</i></font>

267
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,690

278
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,720

kiss a Seoul University student.</font>

was yours that day.</font>

<font color="yellow">That's why I chose it.</font>

286
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,140
<font color="yellow">But it wasn't yours.</font>

287
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,650
<font color="yellow">I like you better.</font>

<font color="yellow">It snowed yesterday, too.</font>

292
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,650
<font color="yellow">Should I leave?</font>

293
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,420
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

294
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,370

295
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,350

300
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,080
<font color="yellow">When I pull an all-nighter in
the editing room, I wear glasses.</font>

301
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,310
<font color="yellow">I've worn them many times.
What kind of one-sided love is this?</font>

302
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,200
<font color="yellow">I really didn't know you wore glasses.</font>

303
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,010
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the second floor.</font>

304
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,580
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

305
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,100
<font color="yellow">There are no doors on the first floor
or any privacy here.</font>

306
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,030
<font color="yellow">I'm like a fish displayed in a market.</font>

307
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,210
<font color="yellow">This is heavy.</font>

308
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,580
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

309
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,070
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

310
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,460
<font color="yellow">- <i>Can I come in?</i>
- Yes.</font>

311
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,070
<font color="yellow">It feels strange because it's
your first night, right?</font>

312
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,840
<font color="yellow">By the way, can you really marry me?</font>

313
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,560
<font color="yellow">You must think I won't be able to.</font>

314
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,300
<font color="yellow">It seems like you fear your mother.</font>

315
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,320
<font color="yellow">Are you teasing me?</font>

316
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,100
<font color="yellow">You look like you'd
listen well to your mom</font>

317
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,150
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

318
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:38,250
<font color="yellow">If we were ever to get married,
I'd only want you, Jung Won.</font>

319
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,700
<font color="yellow">Not your family, money, or anything.</font>

320
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,960
<font color="yellow">Just... you.</font>

321
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,450
<font color="yellow">Then would I better than Hwa Shin?</font>

322
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,030
<font color="yellow">Did you get that wedding invitation too?</font>

323
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,110
<font color="yellow">- Are you going?
- Why would I?</font>

324
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,880
<font color="yellow">You really did date Soo Young, right?</font>

325
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,150
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you that I did.</font>

326
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,010
<font color="yellow">So, she really did date us both.</font>

327
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,060
<font color="yellow">I wonder who she's marrying.</font>

328
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,130
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go.</font>

329
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,930
<font color="yellow">You still have feelings for her?</font>

330
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,550
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take Pyo Na Ri.</font>

331
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,810
<font color="yellow">She was sneaky and dated
both of us for over a year.</font>

332
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,930
<font color="yellow">So I'm going to ask her
who she liked more.</font>

333
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,470
<font color="yellow">I'll ask so Pyo Na Ri can hear.</font>

334
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,710
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

335
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,050
<font color="yellow">I'm confident. Soo Young will say me.</font>

336
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,240
<font color="yellow">She's a pro in dating two men,
and if she chooses me after 20 years</font>

337
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,240
<font color="yellow">wouldn't that mean a lot to Pyo Na Ri?</font>

338
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,100
<font color="yellow">We should help her not waste her time.</font>

339
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,610
<font color="yellow">What if she chooses me?</font>

340
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,080
<font color="yellow">I said I'm confident.</font>

341
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,300
<font color="yellow">Don't do anything stupid and sleep.</font>

342
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,660
<font color="yellow">The three of us are already
doing something stupid.</font>

343
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,300
<font color="yellow">What Soo Young says
and what Pyo Na Ri says...</font>

344
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,230
<font color="yellow">I'll let you know when I get back.</font>

345
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,910
<font color="yellow">Oh, Red.</font>

346
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,060
<font color="yellow">Why did you ask me for, Uncle?</font>

347
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,760
<font color="yellow">I thought I should give this to you.</font>

348
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,390
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

349
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,330
<font color="yellow">Your dad gave this to me
right before he passed away.</font>

350
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,000
<font color="yellow">At first, I kept it to myself because
I was worried about this and that.</font>

351
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,870
<font color="yellow">I think it's best that I give it to you.</font>

352
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,510
<font color="yellow">Neither of your moms know about it.</font>

353
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,800
<font color="yellow">I want you to read it and decide.</font>

354
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,420
<font color="yellow">From what I can tell,
they both seem like good moms.</font>

355
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,640
<font color="yellow"><i>Bang Ja Young will raise Red.</i></font>

356
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,090
<font color="yellow"><i>Bang Ja Young will raise Red.</i></font>

357
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,810
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

358
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,280
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

359
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,440
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

360
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,890
<font color="yellow">I have movie tickets.
Do you want to go with me?</font>

361
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,580
<font color="yellow"><i>[BEFORE I MET YOU]</i></font>

362
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,280
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure.</font>

363
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,700
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at the theater.</font>

364
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,650
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

365
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,060
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you scared me.</font>

366
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,160
<font color="yellow">Hey... go get me a coffee.</font>

367
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,140
<font color="yellow">- We'll be starting soon, Senior.
- Yeah, so hurry up and get it.</font>

368
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,770
<font color="yellow">Yes, all right.</font>

369
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,250
<font color="yellow">Oh, we're starting soon.</font>

370
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,200
<font color="yellow">What is with the young kids these days?</font>

371
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,600
<font color="yellow">Where are you going at this hour?</font>

372
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,110
<font color="yellow">Aren't you on air soon?</font>

373
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,970
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

374
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,980
<font color="yellow">Coffee makes your mouth dry and
makes it difficult to pronounce words.</font>

375
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,970
<font color="yellow">I mixed cold and hot water.
It's lukewarm water.</font>

376
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,330
<font color="yellow">You should drink this.</font>

377
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,870
<font color="yellow">Your tongue will feel better.</font>

378
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,970
<font color="yellow">If I told you to bring me coffee,
you should bring coffee.</font>

379
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,420
<font color="yellow">Who told you to bring me lukewarm water</font>

380
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,000
<font color="yellow">then give me a lecture about my
pronunciation being good or bad?</font>

381
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,500
<font color="yellow">There goes Reporter Park trying
to discipline his partner again.</font>

382
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,750
<font color="yellow">- Hwa Shin, Hwa Shin...
- Get what I asked for!</font>

383
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,570
<font color="yellow">Why is he going up there?</font>

384
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,670
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

385
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,920
<font color="yellow">Reporter Park.</font>

386
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,430
<font color="yellow">Yeah, Reporter Lee.</font>

387
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,960
<font color="yellow">- Drink this.
- Huh?</font>

388
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,940
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

389
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,260
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's nice.</font>

390
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:59,550
<font color="yellow">Senior, should we go over
our opening for today?</font>

391
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,900
<font color="yellow">There were many stories
that developed overnight.</font>

392
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,910
<font color="yellow">News Morning is starting now.</font>

393
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,350
<font color="yellow">Do I have to go over this with you?</font>

394
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,840
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who
needs to work on getting it right.</font>

395
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,810
<font color="yellow">What kind of girl keeps stepping up
where she shouldn't be?</font>

396
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,230
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

397
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,570
<font color="yellow">Also, I'll be doing the
third and fourth items here.</font>

398
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,710
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to do it.</font>

399
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,680
<font color="yellow">Then can I do the first and second?</font>

400
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,330
<font color="yellow">No, those are mine too, of course.</font>

401
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,020
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

402
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,530
<font color="yellow">That punk hasn't changed at all.</font>

403
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,650
<font color="yellow">He treats his partners however he wants,
even when they go out to drink.</font>

404
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,190
<font color="yellow">All right, I got it.</font>

405
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,680
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about it after, okay?</font>

406
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,590
<font color="yellow">How many more minutes are there?
Get ready to go.</font>

409
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,270

410
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,790
<font color="yellow">How is your rooftop apartment?</font>

411
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,950
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

412
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,440
<font color="yellow">It's not uncomfortable?</font>

413
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,810
<font color="yellow">It's a good place to live.</font>

414
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,970
<font color="yellow">Was Reporter Park a bastard
when he worked with you, too?</font>

415
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,580
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

416
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,380
<font color="yellow"><i>You know that girl who you
just did the news with?</i></font>

417
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,870
<font color="yellow"><i>She gets prettier every time I see her.</i></font>

418
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,770
<font color="yellow"><i>Does she have a boyfriend?</i></font>

419
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,880
<font color="yellow">She likes me.</font>

420
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,330
<font color="yellow">Don't joke around. I'm serious.</font>

421
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,280
<font color="yellow">Try to make it work with her.</font>

422
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,720
<font color="yellow">Mom, just wait 10 days.</font>

423
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,070
<font color="yellow">I'll bring my girl to you.</font>

424
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,550
<font color="yellow">What's with that facial expression?</font>

425
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,200
<font color="yellow">I haven't given up on you yet.</font>

426
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,350
<font color="yellow">See you tomorrow.</font>

427
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,360
<font color="yellow">She really is quite something.</font>

428
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,810
<font color="yellow">I wonder if Red is here.</font>

429
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,840
<font color="yellow">Reporter Kye?</font>

430
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,170
<font color="yellow">You can hug people?</font>

431
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,780
<font color="yellow">Why are you in here instead of sleeping?</font>

432
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,420
<font color="yellow">You haven't even changed yet.</font>

433
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,410
<font color="yellow">Do you have something to say?</font>

434
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,320
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

435
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,050
<font color="yellow">- I'll come out. Let's talk outside.
- No.</font>

436
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,050
<font color="yellow">What, what? What is it?</font>

437
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,320
<font color="yellow">Is Reporter Park bothering you?</font>

438
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,620
<font color="yellow">- No.
- He is.</font>

439
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,560
<font color="yellow">- No, he's not.
- He doesn't look down on you?</font>

440
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,020
<font color="yellow">He's good to me.</font>

441
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,310
<font color="yellow">What are you doing sitting here
instead of going to sleep?</font>

442
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,690
<font color="yellow">I'm feeling anxious, okay? I'm nervous.</font>

443
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,810
<font color="yellow">- Are you crazy?
- That little punk.</font>

444
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,430
<font color="yellow">If Reporter Park wants to drink
with you, don't ever go with him.</font>

445
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,300
<font color="yellow">Don't go out to eat with him either.</font>

446
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,650
<font color="yellow">Don't even look him in the eye
when you're doing the news.</font>

447
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,590
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.</font>

448
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,430
<font color="yellow">I want to be with you.</font>

449
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,270
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

450
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,100
<font color="yellow">Sleep with me tonight.</font>

451
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,790
<font color="yellow">Let's pack up and
get out of this hellish place.</font>

452
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,720
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

453
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,110
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Lee?
- Yes?</font>

454
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,220
<font color="yellow">Stop bothering me and leave.</font>

455
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:58,470
<font color="yellow">It's not Reporter Park
who's bothering me, but you.</font>

456
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,990
<font color="yellow">- Yeah.
- Yes, you.</font>

457
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,160
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

458
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,340
<font color="yellow">I'll just sleep. Just sleep.</font>

459
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,430
<font color="yellow">The first floor is so wide and open
that I can't sleep.</font>

460
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,780
<font color="yellow">It doesn't feel right.</font>

461
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,240
<font color="yellow">- Be careful.
- I feel restless there.</font>

462
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,560
<font color="yellow">Just let me...</font>

463
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,650
<font color="yellow">You are too harsh.</font>

464
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,560
<font color="yellow">Don't break the rules.</font>

465
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,420
<font color="yellow">Please, let's go home.</font>

466
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,850
<font color="yellow">Just this once, okay?</font>

467
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,510
<font color="yellow">Aren't you curious?</font>

468
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,940
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not curious.</font>

469
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,230
<font color="yellow">If you're feeling a bit strange here...</font>

470
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,390
<font color="yellow">we could go to the first floor.</font>

471
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,060
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's do that. That'd be better.</font>

472
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,100
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

473
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,080
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

474
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,390
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Enjoy your food.</font>

475
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,370
<font color="yellow">What was Red thinking setting us up
to watch a movie together?</font>

476
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,030
<font color="yellow">It was a romance movie, so I think
she wanted me to watch with you, Chef.</font>

477
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,940
<font color="yellow">She chose me to watch with you
and not Chief Bang.</font>

478
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,460
<font color="yellow">I think that means she is
thinking of me as her mother.</font>

479
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,750
<font color="yellow">I know Red will ask me to live with her.</font>

480
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,580
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

481
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,830
<font color="yellow">So, I'm going to tell you just how much
Pyo Na Ri liked Reporter Lee.</font>

482
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,220
<font color="yellow">Do you know what time it is?
Shut your mouth.</font>

483
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,620
<font color="yellow">Stop telling me about Pyo Na Ri
liking Lee Hwa Shin. Stop it!</font>

484
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,780
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hear it, so just stop it!</font>

485
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,870
<font color="yellow">I said I'd come every day.</font>

486
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:23,680
<font color="yellow">I'd come tell you about Pyo Na Ri and
Lee Hwa Shin like writing in a journal.</font>

487
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:27,350
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to write
in a journal every day.</font>

488
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:38,020
<font color="yellow">I know all about how you played around
when you were studying abroad in the US.</font>

489
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,740
<font color="yellow">Have you had lunch?</font>

490
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,520
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

491
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,490
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat.</font>

492
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,200
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

493
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,870
<font color="yellow">We're going to eat here?</font>

494
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,820
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

495
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,320
<font color="yellow">My girlfriend.</font>

496
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,330
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on your wedding.</font>

497
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,420
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

498
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,910
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

499
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:53,570
<font color="yellow">You didn't think I'd know about you
dating both me and Jung Won, right?</font>

500
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,640
<font color="yellow">I was going to hold on to it
and not forgive you.</font>

501
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,060
<font color="yellow">If you do one thing for me</font>

502
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,290
<font color="yellow">I'll remember you as
my beautiful first love forever.</font>

503
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,700
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

504
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,720
<font color="yellow">Did you like me more or Jung Won?</font>

505
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,520
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee.</font>

506
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,270
<font color="yellow">- Will you give lots of gift money?
- Yes, I will.</font>

507
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,570
<font color="yellow">You liked me more, right?</font>

508
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,020
<font color="yellow">You liked me more than Jung Won, right?</font>

509
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:22,770
<font color="yellow">I'm the one you still thought about
even after breaking up, right?</font>

510
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,210
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

511
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,660
<font color="yellow">Of course I liked Jung Won more.</font>

512
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,900
<font color="yellow">I'm very materialistic.</font>

513
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,780
<font color="yellow">I'm materialistic.</font>

514
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,740
<font color="yellow">Materialistic girls like me too.</font>

515
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,120
<font color="yellow">Then why did you
break up with Go Jung Won?</font>

516
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,270
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

517
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,530
<font color="yellow">He's a filial son.</font>

518
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,830
<font color="yellow">He is now and probably always will be.</font>

519
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,140
<font color="yellow">Between us girls,
filial sons aren't so great.</font>

520
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,280
<font color="yellow">I am not filial.</font>

521
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,740
<font color="yellow">Then why did you break up with him?</font>

522
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,900
<font color="yellow">He is selfish.</font>

523
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,090
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

524
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:04,290
<font color="yellow">He doesn't know how to give love.
He is only used to receiving.</font>

525
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:07,800
<font color="yellow">He gets more jealous than
any girl and gets angry easily.</font>

526
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,840
<font color="yellow">He's only a man in title.</font>

527
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,720
<font color="yellow">Just because you're getting married...
What's with you?</font>

528
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,000
<font color="yellow">All he knew how to do was study,
yet he wanted so much recognition.</font>

529
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,020
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't know this
if you haven't dated him long.</font>

530
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,310
<font color="yellow">He is neat freak to the point that it's
like an illness and he's picky with food.</font>

531
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:26,350
<font color="yellow">It made me anxious just to
go to a restaurant with him.</font>

532
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,650
<font color="yellow">I was worried that there
would be a hair in the food.</font>

533
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,060
<font color="yellow">Then that day's date would be ruined.</font>

534
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:35,840
<font color="yellow">Thinking about cooking and living
with a man like that seemed impossible.</font>

535
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,310
<font color="yellow">He would complain about my food saying
it's too spicy, salty, bland, or sweet.</font>

536
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,860
<font color="yellow">He would always be complaining.</font>

537
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:46,040
<font color="yellow">He would probably say annoying things
while I was doing laundry or cleaning.</font>

538
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,930
<font color="yellow">They say life is most comfortable
when a woman has control over her man.</font>

539
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:51,860
<font color="yellow">He is not a man who would
ever be controlled by a woman.</font>

540
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,150
<font color="yellow">When he was leaving for the army,
he was telling me not to wait for him.</font>

541
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,200
<font color="yellow">He told me to move on from him
and acted like he was so cool.</font>

542
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,800
<font color="yellow">I went out to say goodbye to him
and even shed fake tears for him.</font>

543
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,350
<font color="yellow">Then I went to a night club
and had a ton of fun.</font>

544
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,710
<font color="yellow">He never even let me go to a club.</font>

545
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,180
<font color="yellow">He'd throw a fit if I went to a club</font>

546
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,030
<font color="yellow">and a man's shirt even
touched me in passing.</font>

547
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,950
<font color="yellow">He'd get angry at amusement parks
saying I was looking at men.</font>

548
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,100
<font color="yellow">This country is half men and half women.
How can I only be looking at him?</font>

549
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,580
<font color="yellow">He isn't even considerate.</font>

550
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,360
<font color="yellow">He can't even do any housework.</font>

551
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,640
<font color="yellow">He can't even lift a finger
and tries to get out of it.</font>

552
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,720
<font color="yellow">Gosh...</font>

553
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,030
<font color="yellow">That's why I broke up with him.
Should I go on?</font>

554
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,460
<font color="yellow">There's more?
There can't possibly be more.</font>

555
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,790
<font color="yellow">Hey! Why did you invite me then?</font>

556
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,810
<font color="yellow">I told you before.</font>

557
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,460
<font color="yellow">I want lots of money for my wedding gift.</font>

558
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,250
<font color="yellow">I wanted to show off
my husband too, you jerk.</font>

559
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,070
<font color="yellow">You're annoyed, aren't you?</font>

560
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,950
<font color="yellow">Should I take a picture
of you two? Sit down.</font>

561
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,570
<font color="yellow">Yeah right.</font>

562
00:42:58,594 --> 00:43:10,594
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by DramaFever</font>

563
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,640
<font color="yellow">You made all of this on your own?</font>

564
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,970
<font color="yellow">You'll wake Hwa Shin.</font>

565
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,510
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.</font>

566
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,560
<font color="yellow">I lived alone in the US for four years.</font>

567
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,360
<font color="yellow">If I cook such good food
for you like this</font>

568
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,880
<font color="yellow">you won't want to cook for me later.</font>

569
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,090
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right?</font>

570
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,130
<font color="yellow">I'm a good cook.</font>

571
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,240
<font color="yellow">Let's sit.</font>

572
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,160
<font color="yellow">What did Soo Young say to you
at the wedding yesterday?</font>

573
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,650
<font color="yellow">Was it you?</font>

574
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,840
<font color="yellow">She said it was me, right?</font>

575
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,810
<font color="yellow">You're probably the only person</font>

576
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,790
<font color="yellow">who would go to the
wedding of an ex-girlfriend.</font>

577
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,200
<font color="yellow">You'll be getting another
wedding invitation soon.</font>

578
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,440
<font color="yellow">I'll send you one that says
"Go Jung Won and Pyo Na Ri" on it.</font>

579
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,120
<font color="yellow">You have to come then, too.</font>

580
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,140
<font color="yellow">You went to Soo Young's wedding.</font>

581
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,340
<font color="yellow">So I'm sure you will come to ours.</font>

582
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,470
<font color="yellow">Do you want some stew?</font>

583
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,260
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

584
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:29,210
<font color="yellow">Red, why did you do that yesterday?</font>

585
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,070
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

586
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:36,390
<font color="yellow">Have you made your decision about
which mom you want to live with?</font>

587
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,870
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

588
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,910
<font color="yellow">I've always been obedient of my dad.</font>

589
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,940
<font color="yellow">So you were worried your
other mom would be lonely?</font>

590
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,520
<font color="yellow">That's why you got her
to watch a movie with me?</font>

591
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,520
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

592
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,330
<font color="yellow"><i>[FIRST PRESENT FROM DAUGHTER.]</i></font>

593
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,760
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

594
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,150
<font color="yellow"><i>Our morning news team is
going for drinks. I'm almost there.</i></font>

595
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,330
<font color="yellow">- <i>Go home without me.</i>
- Where is it?</font>

596
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,410
<font color="yellow">Hwa Shin! What are you doing tonight?
Let's go have dinner.</font>

597
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,400
<font color="yellow">I thought the morning news team
went for drinks, so why are you here?</font>

598
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,710
<font color="yellow">Morning team drinks?</font>

599
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:26,590
<font color="yellow">They left me out?</font>

600
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:36,690
<font color="yellow">- Where are you?
- Hey, where are you?</font>

601
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,410
<font color="yellow">Oh, me?</font>

602
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,640
<font color="yellow">The morning news team is having drinks.</font>

603
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,990
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm busy now, so bye.</font>

604
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,250
<font color="yellow">Are you guys going for drinks?</font>

605
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,130
<font color="yellow">I heard all about it
so what do you mean you're not?</font>

606
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,220
<font color="yellow">Everyone else must be late.</font>

607
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,810
<font color="yellow">Hey, pour me a drink.</font>

608
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,410
<font color="yellow">Isn't anyone else coming, Senior?</font>

609
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,460
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

610
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:25,760
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
My arm is going to fall off.</font>

611
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,170
<font color="yellow">Pour me a drink.</font>

612
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:29,640
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

613
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,370
<font color="yellow">Here. You should have a drink too.</font>

614
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:55,760
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'm not going to attack you.</font>

615
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,900
<font color="yellow">Drink.</font>

616
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,140
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

617
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:11,660
<font color="yellow">The two of us...</font>

618
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,580
<font color="yellow">have never done anything
to help with team-building.</font>

619
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:18,780
<font color="yellow">You agree that we need
to do something, right?</font>

620
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,530
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

621
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:28,640
<font color="yellow">Then I will let it all out to you
tonight so that we can resolve things.</font>

622
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,980
<font color="yellow">Senior, I will work very hard.</font>

623
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,420
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Yes.</font>

624
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,720
<font color="yellow">Yes, work hard. Sing a song, okay?</font>

625
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,000
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Okay.</font>

626
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,050
<font color="yellow">About Assistant Director Choi Dong Gi...</font>

627
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:00,120
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't bring that guy up.
I won't feel like drinking anymore.</font>

628
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,660
<font color="yellow">Here, let's drink.</font>

629
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,870
<font color="yellow">Let's drink everyone.</font>

630
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,830
<font color="yellow">Okay! "Wrongful Encounter"!</font>

631
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,680
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri, Pyo Na Ri!</font>

632
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:27,620
<font color="yellow">Pyo Na Ri! Sing it!</font>

633
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:32,960
<font color="yellow"><i>I trusted you as much
as I trusted my friend...</i></font>

634
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:44,370
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

635
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:46,090
<font color="yellow">You dirty bastard.</font>

636
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:48,350
<font color="yellow">Where did you pick up these nasty habits?</font>

637
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,780
<font color="yellow">You go around shaming all reporters.</font>

638
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,750
<font color="yellow">She's your partner, not just some woman.
Pyo Na Ri is not a woman to you?</font>

639
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,750
<font color="yellow">You pathetic man.</font>

640
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,330
<font color="yellow">You're treating her however you want
because she's a contract employee.</font>

641
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,200
<font color="yellow">- Follow me.
- What are you doing?</font>

642
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:08,000
<font color="yellow">You use force on the weak and
act weak to those stronger than you?</font>

643
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,770
<font color="yellow">A reporter should go easy on the weak
and use force on the strong.</font>

644
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:11,950
<font color="yellow">That's a true reporter.</font>

645
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:13,970
<font color="yellow">You dare to send her on coffee errands.</font>

646
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,030
<font color="yellow">You do the news in sweatpants and jeans.</font>

647
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:20,750
<font color="yellow">You steal lines from the female anchors.</font>

648
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,430
<font color="yellow">You ought to be ashamed of yourself.</font>

649
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:25,360
<font color="yellow">Why would you come 10 minutes early
to practice the opening</font>

650
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,450
<font color="yellow">if you're just going to yawn through it?</font>

651
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:33,200
<font color="yellow">If you call in your partner
to drink or eat one more time...</font>

652
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,420
<font color="yellow">I'm going to kill you.</font>

653
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,520
<font color="yellow">And this?</font>

654
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,890
<font color="yellow">It's to repay you for that cigarette
I got from you before.</font>

655
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,800
<font color="yellow">Reflect on your actions
while you smoke this.</font>

656
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,990
<font color="yellow">Go home to your wife and be loyal.</font>

657
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,130
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

658
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,310
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee!</font>

659
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,780
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey. Not over there.</font>

660
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,950
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee.</font>

661
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,500
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing your shoes?</font>

662
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,370
<font color="yellow">You're confused because
it's not your home.</font>

663
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,480
<font color="yellow">It's weird, right?</font>

664
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,750
<font color="yellow">I'm not drunk.</font>

665
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,150
<font color="yellow">This is the bench at my place.</font>

666
00:51:45,174 --> 00:51:56,174
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by DramaFever</font>

667
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:00,660
<font color="yellow">Go upstairs and sleep. Get up.</font>

668
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,200
<font color="yellow">Go up to your room.</font>

669
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,980
<font color="yellow">I knew exactly what
Reporter Park was up to earlier.</font>

670
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,850
<font color="yellow">Do you think I was
insane enough to go alone?</font>

671
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:18,110
<font color="yellow">I told all our staff and crew
to come beforehand.</font>

672
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:22,390
<font color="yellow">I bet the bill came out
to a lot for Reporter Park.</font>

673
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:27,040
<font color="yellow">Don't ever meet him alone.</font>

674
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,590
<font color="yellow">He's a dangerous guy.</font>

675
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:31,120
<font color="yellow">Come on. Go up and sleep comfortably.</font>

676
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:37,940
<font color="yellow">I was even prepared to
record it all, just in case.</font>

677
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,030
<font color="yellow">Your job isn't an easy one.</font>

678
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,710
<font color="yellow">You need to stay on your toes.</font>

679
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,560
<font color="yellow">It's over here.</font>

680
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,450
<font color="yellow">- Sleep.
- Okay.</font>

681
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,620
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Lee.
- What?</font>

682
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:15,100
<font color="yellow">You look very handsome today.</font>

683
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,350
<font color="yellow">It's because you're drunk.</font>

684
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:24,350
<font color="yellow">But you know all those things
Soo Young was saying?</font>

685
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:29,450
<font color="yellow">Strangely, I keep thinking
that Soo Young liked you more.</font>

686
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,810
<font color="yellow">She said she liked Jung Won more.</font>

687
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,850
<font color="yellow">- No, no.
- Don't be ridiculous and just sleep.</font>

688
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:36,560
<font color="yellow">No, it's not true.</font>

689
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,610
<font color="yellow">Soo Young liked you a lot more.</font>

690
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,140
<font color="yellow">Should I take your socks off?</font>

691
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,240
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

692
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:51,140
<font color="yellow">Soo Young knows too much about you.</font>

693
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,370
<font color="yellow">She still remembers it
and is still hurt by it.</font>

694
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,220
<font color="yellow">It's like she still has feelings left.</font>

695
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,960
<font color="yellow">Soo Young even thought to herself
how awful it would be to marry you.</font>

696
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,960
<font color="yellow">She even imagined those things.</font>

697
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,980
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

698
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:06,010
<font color="yellow">Girls don't imagine such things
unless they really like a guy.</font>

699
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,860
<font color="yellow">- You have pretty feet.
- She lied.</font>

700
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:13,410
<font color="yellow">She's still angry at the guy who
dumped her before going to the army.</font>

701
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:14,960
<font color="yellow">This is my gut feeling as a woman.</font>

702
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,440
<font color="yellow">I'm right. She liked you a lot more.</font>

703
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,060
<font color="yellow">Sleep. You have to get up early tomorrow.</font>

704
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,580
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Lee.
- What?</font>

705
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,840
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

706
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,250
<font color="yellow">You're very drunk.</font>

707
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,130
<font color="yellow">Just stay next to me.</font>

708
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,010
<font color="yellow">Don't seduce me.</font>

709
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,580
<font color="yellow">Do you not want to?</font>

710
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,290
<font color="yellow">You'll think I'm an animal
tomorrow morning.</font>

711
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:39,900
<font color="yellow">Oh my. Did I say
I wanted to sleep with you?</font>

712
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,940
<font color="yellow">You are cruel. You really are.</font>

713
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,890
<font color="yellow">Reporter, Reporter, Reporter.</font>

714
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:49,660
<font color="yellow">I have a favor to ask,
so can you please do it for me?</font>

715
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,110
<font color="yellow">Please?</font>

716
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:00,360
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

717
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,810
<font color="yellow">Put on your glasses.</font>

718
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,250
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

719
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:07,990
<font color="yellow">Go to sleep.</font>

720
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,120
<font color="yellow">They're just glasses.</font>

721
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:16,260
<font color="yellow">What is it? Why are you back?</font>

722
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,370
<font color="yellow">Why are you sitting here? Get out.</font>

723
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:20,710
<font color="yellow">I don't touch drunk women.</font>

724
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,090
<font color="yellow">No, just go.</font>

725
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,760
<font color="yellow">You asked me to stay.</font>

726
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,010
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

727
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,860
<font color="yellow">I don't touch drunk girls.
I have my pride.</font>

728
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:32,860
<font color="yellow">Yes. I am drunk, so don't touch me.</font>

729
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,100
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

730
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,410
<font color="yellow">It is nice though.</font>

731
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,270
<font color="yellow">I am dizzy from being drunk
and you're nice and warm.</font>

732
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:56,770
<font color="yellow">It was like hell before,
but now it seems like a long time ago.</font>

733
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,170
<font color="yellow">Did you hit Reporter Park a lot?</font>

734
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,260
<font color="yellow">I wanted to kill him, but I didn't.</font>

735
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,360
<font color="yellow">Reporter Lee.</font>

736
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,410
<font color="yellow">I'm right here so stop calling my name.</font>

737
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,920
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Lee.
- What?</font>

738
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:24,130
<font color="yellow">Why did you like Soo Young?</font>

739
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:26,860
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

740
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,270
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep with her?</font>

741
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,660
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

742
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,260
<font color="yellow">What is there that you don't know?
You know everything.</font>

743
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,860
<font color="yellow">I don't know what I don't know.</font>

744
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,050
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

745
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,880
<font color="yellow">I think I'm tired now.
You should go to sleep.</font>
