- Don't feel pressured.</font>

3

30

<font color="yellow">Your friend, Min Sun Jae.</font>

31
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,270
<font color="yellow">Is it you, Sun Jae?</font>

32
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,710
<font color="yellow">I don't care who you are.</font>

33
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,340

37
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,140
<font color="yellow">He's the guy that smelled of gun powder.</font>

38
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,640
<font color="yellow">He's the minion of the guy...</font>

39

40
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,870

41
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,240
<font color="yellow">if he showed up here.</font>

42
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,440
<font color="yellow">I asked him who hired him,</font>

43
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,110
<font color="yellow">and he told me it was you.</font>

44
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,740
<font color="yellow">What should I do with him?</font>

45
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,310
<font color="yellow">Let him go so that he can go back to whomever is behind this.</font>

46
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,840

47
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,970

50
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,810
<font color="yellow">Not very good.</font>

51

55

59
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,570
<font color="yellow">Why did you pretend not to know it was me?</font>

60
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,110
<font color="yellow">You were asking for someone else. My name is Black.</font>

61

<font color="yellow">Wow, you even drive.</font>

62
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,240
<font color="yellow">It's nice to get away without having to run.</font>

63
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,440
<font color="yellow">I miss running away with you hand in hand.</font>

64
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,170

<font color="yellow">Anyway, digging the past...</font>

251
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,840
<font color="yellow">is dirty for both of us,</font>

258
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,040
<font color="yellow">tiny bit of compassion for Khaya and saved her,</font>

259

<font color="yellow">this tragic thing happened!</font>

260
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,540
<font color="yellow">You see. If she continues to go around like that,</font>

261
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:15,170
<font color="yellow">it will be a matter of time before people find out about you and us!</font>

262
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,070

266

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

269
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,740
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I was curious.</font>

270
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,110
<font color="yellow">I was curious about who you were seeing.</font>

271
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,870
<font color="yellow">I am a reporter after all.</font>

272
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:58,140
<font color="yellow">A news reporter is supposed to dig whatever that intrigues...</font>

273
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,170
<font color="yellow">I was just taking a walk. I wanted to be alone.</font>

274
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,540
<font color="yellow">So you should go first.</font>

275

- Or I will go first.</font>

276

281
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,740
<font color="yellow">Is there no post-box here?</font>

282
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,770
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

283
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,070
<font color="yellow">Black!</font>

284
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,610
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

285
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,470
<font color="yellow">Well, I came because I have something to give you,</font>

286
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,910
<font color="yellow">but someone followed me.</font>

287
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,410
<font color="yellow">And I saw Meutong. You know Meutong, right?</font>

288
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,470
<font color="yellow">The fake doctor who's mad about money.</font>

289
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,640
<font color="yellow">He might report you if he sees you. Be careful.</font>

290
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,510
<font color="yellow">I think I made a mistake.</font>

291
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,370
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have appeared in front of you.</font>

292
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,070
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I do my job.</font>

293
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,170
<font color="yellow">And you do your job. Remember?</font>

294
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,710
<font color="yellow">- You should go now.
- Wait.</font>

295
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,870
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

296
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,440
<font color="yellow">It's nothing, but I hope it will be helpful.</font>

297
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,210
<font color="yellow">I was going to go after I give you this.</font>

298
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,970
<font color="yellow">I didn't get to find Ji Soo,</font>

299
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,140
<font color="yellow">but I am sure you can find her.</font>

300
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:38,310
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I will never come here again.</font>

301
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,070
<font color="yellow">Still, watch out for Meutong. Okay?</font>

302

401
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,570
<font color="yellow">It's doing public relations with reporters from the major press.</font>

402
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,810
<font color="yellow">There will be a lot of reporters that will blow the horn for us.</font>

420
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,410

421
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,710
<font color="yellow">Ma Ri, have a seat.</font>

422
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,580
<font color="yellow">It's because you're here.</font>

423
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,210

424
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,610
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Ji Won changed his name.</font>

425
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,310
<font color="yellow">It's Black. What do you think? Doesn't it suit him?</font>

426
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,670
<font color="yellow">You have a guest.</font>

427
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,940
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

428
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,340
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

429
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,580
<font color="yellow">Is she here to see you?</font>

430
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,370
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

431
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,210
<font color="yellow">Didn't you meet her at the party?</font>

432
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,010
<font color="yellow">This is Kim Swan, President Kim Ji Ryoon's younger sister.</font>

433
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,510
<font color="yellow">She's a reporter and wants to interview me.</font>

434
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,510
<font color="yellow">I don't believe we were formally introduced.</font>

435
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
<font color="yellow">Hi, I'm Min Sun Jae.</font>

436
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,910
<font color="yellow">I can wait outside since you're having dinner.</font>

437
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:26,970
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

438
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,310
<font color="yellow">Join us.</font>

439
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,970
<font color="yellow">I guess we'll need more wine.</font>

440
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:36,310
<font color="yellow">Honey, would you help me choose a bottle?</font>

441
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,010
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you were here.</font>

442
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,970
<font color="yellow">- I'll leave.
- It's fine.</font>

443
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,270
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

444
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,670
<font color="yellow">You seem weird today. Why would you invite her?</font>

445
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,610
<font color="yellow">What if she recognises Ji Won?</font>

446
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,170
<font color="yellow">You said he's Black.</font>

447
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,110
<font color="yellow">What are you worried about when he even changed his name?</font>

448
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,040
<font color="yellow">Even if she recognises him, she's President Kim's sister.</font>

449
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,040
<font color="yellow">She won't report to the police.</font>

450
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,240
<font color="yellow">- Ma Ri.
- This one looks good.</font>

451
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,080
<font color="yellow">Should I get you something else?</font>

452
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,940
<font color="yellow">No, this tastes good.</font>

453
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,240
