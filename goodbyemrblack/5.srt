155
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,350
<font color="yellow">the best for getting girls pregnant.</font>

156
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,520
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, I took a guest to Gangwon Province.</font>

157
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,250
<font color="yellow">I went inside a field and caught these myself.</font>

158
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,150
<font color="yellow">Was it a rice field?</font>

159
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,650
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I didn't get to work...</font>

160
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,850
<font color="yellow">all day yesterday to catch these.</font>

161
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,550
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

162
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,280
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

163
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,150
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you didn't have to do this.</font>

164
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,480
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

165
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,950
<font color="yellow">Please cook it well for her.</font>

166
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,250
<font color="yellow">Don't eat it all while pretending to taste it.</font>

167
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,880
<font color="yellow">- Father.
- Yes?</font>

168
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,750
<font color="yellow">Sun Jae is still home.</font>

169
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,850
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

170
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,380
<font color="yellow">Then I should leave now.</font>

171
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,850
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

172
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,450
<font color="yellow">- Take care of yourself. Bye.
- Okay.</font>

173
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,150
<font color="yellow">What's the use of calling me Father?</font>

174
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,480
<font color="yellow">She never invites me for a meal.</font>

175
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,450
<font color="yellow">Gosh, well...</font>

176
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,450
<font color="yellow">I can't wish my daughter-in-law to treat me well when my son doesn't.</font>

177
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,280
<font color="yellow">The customer must be near this hotel.</font>

178
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,380
<font color="yellow">- Did you call the taxi, Sir?
- Yes.</font>

179
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,150
<font color="yellow">Where are you headed?</font>

180
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,750
<font color="yellow">Take me to the nearest gukbab restaurant.</font>

181
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,850
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

182
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,850
<font color="yellow">By the way, why don't you eat at the hotel?</font>

183
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,150
<font color="yellow">I don't like the hotel food.</font>

184
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,680
<font color="yellow">Your taste is just like mine.</font>

185
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,680
<font color="yellow">Are you... Gosh!</font>

186
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,420
<font color="yellow">Hello, there!</font>

187
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,850
<font color="yellow">- Come on!
- Come on!</font>

188
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,650
<font color="yellow">- There you go!
- Yes!</font>

189
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,380
<font color="yellow">- I got it.
- Gosh...</font>

190
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,650
<font color="yellow">Hi, there.</font>

191
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,850
<font color="yellow">Where is Park Ho Sik?</font>

192
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,050
<font color="yellow">What? What's wrong?</font>

193
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,550
<font color="yellow">You want me to look there?</font>

194
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

195
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,350
<font color="yellow">Can I take her out?</font>

196
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,320
<font color="yellow">Do one thing at a time.</font>

197
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,250
<font color="yellow">It's either gamble or woman.</font>

198
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,950
<font color="yellow">I always do three things at the same time.</font>

199
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,750
<font color="yellow">Gambling, woman and booze.</font>

200
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,220
<font color="yellow">Give me something strong.</font>

201
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,650
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

202
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,420
<font color="yellow">She's mine.</font>

203
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,250
<font color="yellow">What a lunatic!</font>

204
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

205
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,320
<font color="yellow">Do you deliver jokbal?</font>

206
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,650
<font color="yellow">What's this now?</font>

207
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,150
<font color="yellow">If this is a prank call, I will kill you!</font>

208
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,120
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

209
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,520
<font color="yellow">Khaya?</font>

210
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,780
<font color="yellow">Why is she there?</font>

211
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,850
<font color="yellow">He's there.</font>

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,750
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

215
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,750
<font color="yellow">Do you want some juice?</font>

216
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,550
<font color="yellow">You reported to Panda News, right?</font>

217
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,750
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I don't have money. I can't give you tip.</font>

218
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,650
<font color="yellow">I am not asking for tip.</font>

221
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,750
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with this girl?</font>

222
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,050
<font color="yellow">Is she crazy? Hey!</font>

223
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,850
<font color="yellow">Don't bother him today.</font>

224
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:35,850
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

225
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,480
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

226
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,380
<font color="yellow">I never believed it.</font>

227
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,150
<font color="yellow">You must not have killed...</font>

228
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,290
<font color="yellow">It doesn't make sense that you are a murderer.</font>

229
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,420
<font color="yellow">You are the best.</font>

230
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,750
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

231
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,850
<font color="yellow">is it okay for you to go around in public?</font>

232
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,550
<font color="yellow">You're a murderer.</font>

233
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,520
<font color="yellow">You said you didn't believe it.</font>

234
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,520
<font color="yellow">Of course I don't,</font>

235
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,790
<font color="yellow">but the world isn't like me.</font>

236
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,150
<font color="yellow">Eat.</font>

237
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,550
<font color="yellow">Eat some kimchi, too.</font>

238
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,650

240
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,050
<font color="yellow">- I should turn myself in.
- Turn yourself in?</font>

241

<font color="yellow">I haven't done anything wrong, but I need to find Ji Soo.</font>

242
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,820
<font color="yellow">Only family members can file a missing report, right?</font>

243
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,790
<font color="yellow">Hey, you can't.</font>

244
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,150
<font color="yellow">You can't do that.</font>

245
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,050
<font color="yellow">You know that I'm an expert in that area.</font>

246
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,850
<font color="yellow">If you get a crime record, your life will be doomed.</font>

247
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,850
<font color="yellow">You could be locked up in jail for the rest of your life.</font>

248
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,050
<font color="yellow">Don't do it.</font>

249
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,020
<font color="yellow">Just run away, okay?</font>

250
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,150
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of running away.</font>

251
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,550
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

252
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,250
<font color="yellow">I'll buy a well-renowned law firm and go on the trial...</font>

253
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,180
<font color="yellow">to clear my name.</font>

254
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,550
<font color="yellow">What? You'll buy a law firm?</font>

255
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,620
<font color="yellow">- Where will you get the money from?
- What?</font>

256
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,880
<font color="yellow">I'm the only son of Sunwoo Group's chairman. I have inheritance.</font>

257
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,550
<font color="yellow">- Oh, what?
- Sun Jae has grown the company.</font>

258
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,150
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it won't be a big deal.</font>

259
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,720
<font color="yellow">You'll bring food for me if I get locked up, right?</font>

260
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,350
<font color="yellow">What? Of course. Eat up.</font>

261
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,750
<font color="yellow">Oh, is someone calling me?</font>

262
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,350
<font color="yellow">I had a call. I'll be right back.</font>

263
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,880
<font color="yellow">(MY SON)</font>

264
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,450
<font color="yellow">You're here early.</font>

265
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,650
<font color="yellow">You'll need to get rid of Cha Ji Won before the shareholders' meeting.</font>

266
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,920
<font color="yellow">If he causes trouble again,</font>

267
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,520
<font color="yellow">- I won't stop him this time.
- No.</font>

268
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,350
<font color="yellow">You'll need to work harder to stop him.</font>

269
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,150
<font color="yellow">Did you already forget the Chairman Cha incident?</font>

270
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,650
<font color="yellow">And one more thing.</font>

271
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,880
<font color="yellow">Make sure that the casino complex resort business is trouble-free.</font>

272
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,250
<font color="yellow">Do not disgrace Sunwoo Group which I've worked so hard to protect.</font>

273
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,250
<font color="yellow">It looks like I was worried for nothing.</font>

274
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,620
<font color="yellow">I'm glad to know that these things don't scare you any more.</font>

275
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,720
<font color="yellow">Is there anything else you want to say?</font>

276
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,250
<font color="yellow">Your father wants to speak to you urgently about your friend.</font>

277
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,620
<font color="yellow">Answer the call. Your father is waiting.</font>

278
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,450
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
- Sun Jae. Don't hang up.</font>

279
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,050
<font color="yellow">Ji Won is back.</font>

280
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,420

281
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,250
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

282
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,290
<font color="yellow">The bigger problem is...</font>

283
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,980
<font color="yellow">he wants his money back.</font>

284
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,720
<font color="yellow">He said that he'll claim his inheritance.</font>

285
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,550
<font color="yellow">You have to take up the chairman position soon.</font>

286
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,290
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

287
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
<font color="yellow">Where are you now?</font>

288
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,650
<font color="yellow">- I'm asking you now!
- Oh, yes. Sorry.</font>

289
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,920
<font color="yellow">Well... We are...</font>

290
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,290
<font color="yellow">You know that main road, right?</font>

291
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,250
<font color="yellow">You seem to be very busy.</font>

292
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,880
<font color="yellow">I got the bill. I'll see you again.</font>

293
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,050
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ji Won. Ji Won!</font>

294
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,550
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

295
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
<font color="yellow">He will turn himself in?</font>

296
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,350
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm exhausted.</font>

297
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,420
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

298
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,850
<font color="yellow">Gosh, spending money is tiring.</font>

299
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,050
<font color="yellow">Oh, have you heard?</font>

300
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,620
<font color="yellow">Everyone is saying that Ms Yoon is seeing someone else.</font>

301
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,280
<font color="yellow">Aren't you the one who spread the rumour?</font>

302
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,020
<font color="yellow">What good would spreading that kind of rumour do for us?</font>

303
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,050
<font color="yellow">It's better for us that Ms Yoon doesn't get divorced.</font>

304
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,820
<font color="yellow">Sunwoo Construction will be split in half if she demands the partition.</font>

305
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,620
<font color="yellow">Why do people want that happy couple to get divorced?</font>

306
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,550
<font color="yellow">People are so mean.</font>

307
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,820
<font color="yellow">Don't try to protect her just because you're close to her.</font>

308
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,880
<font color="yellow">Even five years ago, she was going to marry Chairman Cha's son...</font>

309
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,150
<font color="yellow">and sent out wedding invitations but ended up marrying her friend.</font>

310
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,180
<font color="yellow">She's something else.</font>

311
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,250
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm here. I'll go out.</font>

312
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,450
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm really sorry about yesterday.</font>

313
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,150
<font color="yellow">I'll visit you soon.</font>

314
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,450
<font color="yellow">- She must've heard us.
- Gosh, what should we do?</font>

315
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,820
<font color="yellow">Your husbands could lose their jobs because of your chatters.</font>

316
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,650
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you should really watch what you say.</font>

317
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,350
<font color="yellow">He is really picky,</font>

318
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,050
<font color="yellow">so I'd love some help with styling.</font>

319
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,950
<font color="yellow">This is my first time in Korea, so I don't know my way around.</font>

320
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,950
<font color="yellow">It's your first time in Korea?</font>

321
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,420
<font color="yellow">Your Korean is so good!</font>

322
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,950
<font color="yellow">I live with a Korean man.</font>

323
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,050
<font color="yellow">So you're married?</font>

324
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,350
<font color="yellow">I don't have to be married to live with someone, right?</font>

325
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,420
<font color="yellow">- What's the matter?
- I felt like someone was following.</font>

326
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,650
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Have a meal with the president of MRB Funds.</font>

327
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,650
<font color="yellow">The strength of the distribution channel won him over,</font>

328
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,020
<font color="yellow">but he initially wanted to work with Sunwoo Construction.</font>

329
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,250
<font color="yellow">The president of MRB Funds is in Seoul now.</font>

330
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,650
<font color="yellow">It looks like the two live together.</font>

331
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,450
<font color="yellow">- Shall I arrange a dinner?
- You're better than Mr Choi.</font>

332
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,780
<font color="yellow">Don't work too hard. I'll see you at home.</font>

333
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,750
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

334
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,650
<font color="yellow">Call me right away if he gets in touch.</font>

335
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,320
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

336
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,650
<font color="yellow">I'm your dad, so I'll look out for you.</font>

337
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,280
<font color="yellow">No matter how close I am with Ji Won, I'll always be on your side.</font>

338
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,350
<font color="yellow">You should go now.</font>

339
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,620
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay.</font>

340
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,820
<font color="yellow">But Sun Jae.</font>

341
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,250
<font color="yellow">Five years ago,</font>

342
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,820
<font color="yellow">you didn't actually do anything to Ji Won...</font>

343
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,250
<font color="yellow">- and Chairman Cha, did you?
- Get off.</font>

344
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay. I'll go now.</font>

345
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,980
<font color="yellow">Don't skip meals, okay?</font>

346
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:57,004
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU.</font>

347
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,320
<font color="yellow">May I try it on...</font>

348
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,220
<font color="yellow">if you're not going to buy it?</font>

349
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,950
<font color="yellow">Gosh, no. I don't like plaid.</font>

350
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,020
<font color="yellow">I only wear solid colours.</font>

351
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,150
<font color="yellow">You can't go for a movie wearing that!</font>

352
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,580
<font color="yellow">Goodness. It's dark, so no one will even see me.</font>

353
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,880
<font color="yellow">What about me? You don't think I have eyes?</font>

354
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,120
<font color="yellow">You wear the same thing every day.</font>

355
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,950
<font color="yellow">It embarrasses me!</font>

356
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,820
<font color="yellow">Ma Ri. Do I really embarrass you?</font>

357
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,650
<font color="yellow">I'm going to embarrass you more.</font>

358
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,080
<font color="yellow">Wear this.</font>

359
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,550
<font color="yellow">- Hey, how could you...
- All right.</font>

360
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,620
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Let's go to the room and get changed.</font>

361
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
<font color="yellow">Hang on.</font>

362
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,180
<font color="yellow">We're... We're going to the room?</font>

363
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,420
<font color="yellow">Shall we shoot a movie instead of watching one? An erotic film?</font>

364
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,820
<font color="yellow">Goodness! Stop it!</font>

365
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,020
<font color="yellow">Listen to me, okay?</font>

366
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,420
<font color="yellow">From now on and forever,</font>

367
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,920
<font color="yellow">- only wear things I approve, okay?
- For the rest of my life?</font>

368
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,620
<font color="yellow">Do you like me that much, Ma Ri?</font>

369
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,350
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. Hey!
- Ouch!</font>

370
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,650
<font color="yellow">- Ouch! My arm!
- Gosh.</font>

371
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
<font color="yellow">I can't?</font>

372
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,050
<font color="yellow">I want to wear what you picked out.</font>

373
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,320
<font color="yellow">Ms Yoon?</font>

374
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,780
<font color="yellow">What do you think of this one?</font>

375
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,720
<font color="yellow">Let's browse more.</font>

376
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,620
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

377
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,520
<font color="yellow">Come to my place if you have something to say.</font>

378
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,550
<font color="yellow">Pretend that you don't know me here.</font>

379
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,120
<font color="yellow">I told you to wait for me.</font>

380
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,050
<font color="yellow">Don't do this.</font>

381
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,180
<font color="yellow">- I'm with an important guest.
- I told you to wait.</font>

382
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,920
<font color="yellow">You promised me.</font>

383
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,750
<font color="yellow">It's all in the past.</font>

384
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,480
<font color="yellow">Did you not read...</font>

385
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
<font color="yellow">the card I sent you?</font>

386
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,220
<font color="yellow">What card?</font>

387
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,320
<font color="yellow">Don't show up before me like this ever again.</font>

388
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,450
<font color="yellow">Ma Ri, Merry Christmas.</font>

389
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,620
<font color="yellow">It's still summer here.</font>

390
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,050
<font color="yellow">I miss you even in my dreams.</font>

391
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,580
<font color="yellow">Christmas in the middle of summer.</font>

392
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,950
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm still in my dream.</font>

393
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,420
<font color="yellow">Don't forget that I'll come back for you no matter what it takes.</font>

394
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,250
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

395
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,550
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

396
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,220
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

397
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,720
<font color="yellow">I'm going to die in front of them...</font>

398
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,350
<font color="yellow">to go back to you.</font>

399
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,550
<font color="yellow">Don't be too shocked even if you hear that I'm dead.</font>

400
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,220
<font color="yellow">You look good in that jacket.</font>

401
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,750
<font color="yellow">I do?</font>

402
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,450
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's cut out for you.</font>

403
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,720
<font color="yellow">Remember our promise...</font>

404
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,020
<font color="yellow">that we'll get married barefoot on the beach.</font>

405
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,820
<font color="yellow">I won't ever die and leave you behind.</font>

406
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,750
<font color="yellow">I love you. From Ji Won.</font>

407
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,080
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

408
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,150
<font color="yellow">Let's go with this schedule.</font>

409
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,920
<font color="yellow">Once Sunwoo Distribution buys the land for the resort,</font>

410
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,350
<font color="yellow">we'll sign the contract.</font>

411
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,780
<font color="yellow">There won't be much difference from signing right now.</font>

412
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,050
<font color="yellow">If it gets behind the schedule and the construction takes longer,</font>

413
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,350
<font color="yellow">we'd have to wait longer to get our investment back.</font>

414
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,750
<font color="yellow">We'll deal with it by this month.</font>

415
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,020
<font color="yellow">If you feel uncomfortable,</font>

416
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,350
<font color="yellow">you can add articles regarding the land and construction period.</font>

417
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,620
<font color="yellow">In that case,</font>

418
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,920
<font color="yellow">I want a higher compensation in case you breach the contract.</font>

419
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

420
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,220
<font color="yellow">In return, I'd like the deposit of 20 million dollars...</font>

421
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,120
<font color="yellow">by this week.</font>

422
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,620
<font color="yellow">- This week?
- If you're going to work with us,</font>

423
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,020
<font color="yellow">you should speed things up.</font>

424
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,050
<font color="yellow">MRB Funds isn't the only investment company we can work with.</font>

425
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,820
<font color="yellow">He is going firm.</font>

426
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,120
<font color="yellow">We'll need the money as soon as possible.</font>

427
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,520
<font color="yellow">Don't grudge.</font>

428
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,420
<font color="yellow">You'll get way more in return soon enough.</font>

429
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
<font color="yellow">President Kim.</font>

430
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,350
<font color="yellow">Hey, Black.</font>

431
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,020
<font color="yellow">Were you at the party?</font>

432
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,720
<font color="yellow">That's why you weren't surprised.</font>

433
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,620
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you'll be okay fighting against them?</font>

434
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,250
<font color="yellow">You could report to the police if I seem to be in trouble.</font>

435
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,020
<font color="yellow">Everyone is ignoring me.</font>

436
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,880
<font color="yellow">They're hiding a criminal, aren't they?</font>

437
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,880
<font color="yellow">It would be interesting to go to prison with Sun Jae.</font>

438
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,620
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't go to prison without my friend.</font>

439
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,220
<font color="yellow">- Then should I...
- I won't tell anyone I met you.</font>

440
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,650
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ji Ryoon!</font>

441
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,550
<font color="yellow">Woo Jin.</font>

442
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,850
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, I didn't know he had a visitor.</font>

443
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,250
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

444
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,320
<font color="yellow">Where is Swan?</font>

445
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,680
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

446
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,720
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking when you introduced her to me?</font>

447
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,350
<font color="yellow">I don't have time. Give me the money.</font>

448
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,050
<font color="yellow">I don't owe you any money.</font>

449
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,550
<font color="yellow">Where is it? I'll go.</font>

450
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,250
<font color="yellow">I have to be the one going.</font>

451
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,150
<font color="yellow">I have to be the one to find Swan.</font>

452
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,180
<font color="yellow">I don't care if it's cash or a credit card. I need something.</font>

453
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,820
<font color="yellow">- Call me if anything happens.
- Okay, thanks.</font>

454
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,120
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of some errands and contact you again.</font>

455
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,420
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. That was a friend of mine.</font>

456
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,350
<font color="yellow">He's the editor-in-chief of news company Swan works for.</font>

457
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,350
<font color="yellow">Aren't you curious how Swan is doing?</font>

458
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,080
<font color="yellow">- I'm sure she's doing fine.
- She's still searching for Ji Soo.</font>

459
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,820
<font color="yellow">Why? I'll find Ji Soo.</font>

460
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,650
<font color="yellow">Please tell her to stop.</font>

461
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,820
<font color="yellow">She won't listen to me.</font>

462
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,880
<font color="yellow">You know how headstrong she is.</font>

463
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,520
<font color="yellow">Everyone thought Black was dead, but Swan was the only one...</font>

464
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,050
<font color="yellow">who believed you were alive.</font>

465
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,150
<font color="yellow">If you aren't going to go see her, make sure she doesn't find you.</font>

466
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,420
<font color="yellow">- Wow!
- Yes, I won!</font>

467
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,180
<font color="yellow">How long is he going to stay here?</font>

468
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,220
<font color="yellow">Leech won't be happy about this if he finds out.</font>

469
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,350
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

470
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,920
<font color="yellow">I won't be here for long, so exchange these into big chips.</font>

471
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,350
<font color="yellow">Where did you get that money?</font>

472
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,220
<font color="yellow">Stay out of this. I'll get Park Ho Sik.</font>

473
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,750
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

474
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,650
<font color="yellow">This is your pay check. You're fired.</font>

475
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,320

478
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,480
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

479
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,920
<font color="yellow">Got it.</font>

480
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:38,250
<font color="yellow">We're to get Park Ho Sik's signature and get rid of him today.</font>

481
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,620
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

482
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,880
<font color="yellow">We have to leave.</font>

483
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,120
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

484
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,580
<font color="yellow">They're going to get rid of you like they did with Kim Jung Ho.</font>

485
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,920
<font color="yellow">You know him, don't you?</font>

486
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,720
<font color="yellow">Didn't I see you at the funeral?</font>

487
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,980
<font color="yellow">- Be quiet.
- The reporter?</font>

488
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,050
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

489
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,450
<font color="yellow">- Who in the world are you?
- I told her to stay out of this.</font>

490
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,420
<font color="yellow">This is all a scam!</font>

491
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,650
<font color="yellow">You're all in this, aren't you?</font>

492
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,190
<font color="yellow">How dare you!</font>

493
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:31,690
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

494
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,050
<font color="yellow">Mr Seo!</font>

495
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,280
<font color="yellow">Why that little...</font>

496
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,950
<font color="yellow">- What's going on?
- What's happening?</font>

497
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,320
<font color="yellow">- Let's get out of here.
- It's the police!</font>

498
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,320
<font color="yellow">Get them all!</font>

499
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,880
<font color="yellow">Come this way!</font>

500
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,280
<font color="yellow">- Mr Seo! Find Park Ho Sik.
- Are you all right?</font>

501
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,480
<font color="yellow">I'll find him. You get out of here.</font>

502
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,520
<font color="yellow">That way!</font>

503
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,820

504
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,020
<font color="yellow">Get Park Ho Sik!</font>

505
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,750
<font color="yellow">- We need to get his signature!
- Yes, sir.</font>

506
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,150
<font color="yellow">- Close the door.
- Yes, sir.</font>

507
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,150
<font color="yellow">- What's this?
- Who called the police?</font>

508
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,080
<font color="yellow">- Who was it?
- Goodness!</font>

509
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,450
<font color="yellow">Move it!</font>

510
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,420
<font color="yellow">Mr Park Ho Sik!</font>

511
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,350
<font color="yellow">Wait in the car.</font>

512
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,620
<font color="yellow">Get her!</font>

513
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,650
<font color="yellow">Get Park Ho Sik!</font>

514
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,520
<font color="yellow">Mr Park!</font>

515
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
<font color="yellow">Catch her!</font>

516
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,020
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

517
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,250
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- You!</font>

518
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,190
<font color="yellow">Where's Park Ho Sik?</font>

519
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,350
<font color="yellow">Stay still if you don't want to get hurt.</font>

520
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,580
<font color="yellow">Stop right there.</font>

521
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,950
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

522
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,020
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop!</font>

523
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,420
<font color="yellow">Stop!</font>

524
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,190
<font color="yellow">It's me, Swan.</font>

525
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,580
<font color="yellow">You're alive.</font>

526
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,980
<font color="yellow">I knew you were alive.</font>

527
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,020
<font color="yellow">Want a ride?</font>

528
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,880
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

529
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,850
<font color="yellow">It's Black.</font>

530
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,850
<font color="yellow">I heard his voice. It's Black.</font>

531
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,820
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind? Cha Ji Won is dead.</font>

532
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,250
<font color="yellow">Hi, I'm Kim Swan.</font>

533
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,690
<font color="yellow">I hope we can get along.</font>

534
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,650
<font color="yellow">Take good care of her.</font>

535
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,250
<font color="yellow">Good luck!</font>

536
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,350
<font color="yellow">Ji Ryoon!</font>

537
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,250
<font color="yellow">Come this way. I'll show you your desk.</font>

538
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,190
<font color="yellow">Who is this? Your boyfriend?</font>

539
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,250
<font color="yellow">No, he's my husband.</font>

540
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,780
<font color="yellow">- It's going to be tough on you...
- Husband?</font>

541
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,720
<font color="yellow">if you're married.</font>

542
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,120
<font color="yellow">We work 24 hours.</font>

543
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,820
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best.</font>

544
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,880

00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,950
<font color="yellow">How long did you think you could fool me?</font>

548
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,750

549
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,120
<font color="yellow">You're not even married.</font>

550
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,820
<font color="yellow">I'm not lying.</font>

551
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,250
<font color="yellow">He ran away and hasn't come back yet.</font>

552
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,980
<font color="yellow">It was a fake marriage,</font>

553
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,020
<font color="yellow">but we were able to hide behind it.</font>

554
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,150
<font color="yellow">That's how we survived.</font>

555
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,150
<font color="yellow">He made scrambled eggs for me...</font>

556
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,580
<font color="yellow">and drew pictures when I told him I couldn't read.</font>

557
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,850
<font color="yellow">What about Swan?</font>

558
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
<font color="yellow">Swan.</font>

559
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,250
<font color="yellow">He even named me. How could I forget his voice?</font>

560
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,190
<font color="yellow">I know it's him.</font>

561
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,020
<font color="yellow">Does he know...</font>

<font color="yellow">that you're waiting for him?</font>

563
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,880
<font color="yellow">I guess that isn't important.</font>

564
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,120
<font color="yellow">In order to survive,</font>

565
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,850
<font color="yellow">we need food more than anything.</font>

566
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,920
<font color="yellow">I'm starving.</font>

567
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,850
<font color="yellow">Let's go, I'll make you eggs.</font>

568
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,150
<font color="yellow">We found nothing.</font>

569
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,190
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. They won't find anything.</font>

570
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,320
<font color="yellow">Make the delivery as soon as the sweep is done.</font>

571
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,080
<font color="yellow">And find Park Ho Sik.</font>

572
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,880

574
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:46,690
<font color="yellow">He caught the bait. We just have to reel him in.</font>

575
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,050
<font color="yellow">Why are you holding me here?</font>

576
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,480
<font color="yellow">Are you kidnappers or what?</font>

577
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,780
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sue you for kidnapping and locking me up.</font>

578
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,550
<font color="yellow">We're having eggs for late night snacks from now on.</font>

579
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,020
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What?</font>

580
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,690
<font color="yellow">Don't you hear me?</font>

581
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,950
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sue you.</font>

582
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,220
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

583
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,220
<font color="yellow">Those are all complaints.</font>

584
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,820
<font color="yellow">Stand in line.</font>

585
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,750
<font color="yellow">The door is open.</font>

586
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,280
<font color="yellow">You can leave if you'd like.</font>

587
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,320
<font color="yellow">Miss, you said the gang was going to get rid of me.</font>

588
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,420
<font color="yellow">How am I supposed to feel safe out there?</font>

589
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,020
<font color="yellow">How are you related to Kim Jung Ho, who died on Mount Cheonggye?</font>

590
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,820
<font color="yellow">Do you have any hunches to why he died?</font>

591
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,220
<font color="yellow">I couldn't say even if I knew.</font>

592
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,250
<font color="yellow">How am I supposed to trust a tiny news company like this?</font>

593
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,920
<font color="yellow">Good boy.</font>

594
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:51,820
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you a soccer ball when you're back on your feet.</font>

595
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,550
<font color="yellow">Ms Yoon?</font>

596
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,420
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

597
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,450
<font color="yellow">I wore the clothes you picked out for me.</font>

598
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,480
<font color="yellow">Am I good enough for you now?</font>

599
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,780
<font color="yellow">The weather is too good to watch a movie today.</font>

600
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,780
<font color="yellow">Let's go out.</font>

601
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,280
<font color="yellow">I will follow you. Be careful with your driving.</font>

602
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,350
<font color="yellow">Okay, Sir.</font>

603
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,080
<font color="yellow">Where are we going?</font>

604
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,350
<font color="yellow">We have to keep our promise.</font>

605
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,350
<font color="yellow">We're going to the beach.</font>

606
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,950
<font color="yellow">Ji Won.</font>

607
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,780
<font color="yellow">Goodness! Is he crazy?</font>

608
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:32,450
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

609
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,780
<font color="yellow">What is he doing? Is he drunk?</font>

610
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,150
<font color="yellow">Hey! what on earth...</font>
