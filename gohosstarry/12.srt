<font color="yellow">Thoughts?</font>

8
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:06,031
<font color="yellow">I didn't look on purpose.</font>

9
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:07,216
<font color="yellow">Not on purpose?</font>

10
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:10,993
<font color="yellow">You were just under the desk in an empty
meeting room, minding your own business.</font>

11
00:02:10,993 --> 00:02:12,538
<font color="yellow">We all came in.</font>

12
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:16,124
<font color="yellow">I'll just assume that you had
no choice, and were forced to see it.</font>

13
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:18,124
<font color="yellow">So, what are your thoughts?</font>

14
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:22,886
<font color="yellow">I had to see it.</font>

15
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:26,427
<font color="yellow">There's something I haven't told you.</font>

16
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:31,165
<font color="yellow">You know Yang Jin Kyung, the model?</font>

17
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,636
<font color="yellow">She was dating the client.</font>

18
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:35,224
<font color="yellow">It ended.</font>

19
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:40,299
<font color="yellow">She didn't want to cause problems,
so she asked us to take care of it.</font>

20
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:41,669
<font color="yellow">That's why he hated everything.</font>

21
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:45,454
<font color="yellow">So... everything would have been fine
if we just changed the model?</font>

22
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:48,406
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- That was it?</font>

23
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:52,636
<font color="yellow">Then wouldn't your team win,
if you changed the model?</font>

24
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:56,155
<font color="yellow">I thought that you would
feel that way, Manager.</font>

25
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:57,224
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

26
00:02:58,988 --> 00:03:00,975
<font color="yellow">I would feel a little dirty
if I won like that.</font>

27
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:03,100
<font color="yellow">So I watched yours.</font>

28
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,894
<font color="yellow">If your presentation wasn't so great,
I could feel okay about not telling you.</font>

29
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:08,589
<font color="yellow">I would be sure that our team would win.</font>

30
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:10,743
<font color="yellow">But?</font>

31
00:03:10,743 --> 00:03:12,077
<font color="yellow">We lost.</font>

32
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:15,548
<font color="yellow">Even if we switched our model</font>

33
00:03:15,548 --> 00:03:19,452
<font color="yellow">I think that any client with eyes
would have chosen yours, Manager.</font>

34
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:22,562
<font color="yellow">He has no brain,
so how could he have eyes?</font>

35
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:27,689
<font color="yellow">Why do you look so down?</font>

36
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:30,278
<font color="yellow">It was your idea, right?</font>

37
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,627
<font color="yellow">I can tell these things by now.</font>

38
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:36,078
<font color="yellow">It has your touch, Manager.</font>

39
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:41,977
<font color="yellow">But... I really can't understand it.</font>

40
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:45,267
<font color="yellow">How could you make something
that feels like that?</font>

41
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,887
<font color="yellow">It doesn't suit you at all.</font>

42
00:03:53,418 --> 00:03:55,596
<font color="yellow">For a long time,
I was part of a one-way love story.</font>

cared more about feelings than your work.</font>

Will you talk to me?</font>

77

83
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,824
<font color="yellow">So, just talk to me for a bit.
You ignore my calls and texts!</font>

84
00:08:04,824 --> 00:08:07,111
<font color="yellow">Seriously! Give it to me now.</font>

85
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:12,240

00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:36,454
<font color="yellow">Move, now!</font>

88
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:38,536
<font color="yellow">What is your reason for disliking me?</font>

89
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:40,661
<font color="yellow">I don't understand.</font>

90
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:45,813
<font color="yellow">If you're not jealous,
why do you care about Kate or Ketchup?</font>

91
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:48,737
<font color="yellow">If you are jealous,
then that means you like me.</font>

92
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,374
<font color="yellow">So, why ignore me?</font>

93
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:54,304
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that, and sleep
with me, just once.</font>

94
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:58,645
<font color="yellow">Try sleeping with me, and if
you don't like me, then that's fine.</font>

95
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:00,619
<font color="yellow">I'm very confident.</font>

96
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:04,517
<font color="yellow">I can guarantee you that
you will never regret it.</font>

97
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,934
<font color="yellow">Have you ever been clingy
with a girl before?</font>

98

<font color="yellow">Of course, not.</font>

99

but I am really cool.</font>

100
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:15,522
<font color="yellow">Then you should be good
at getting rejected.</font>

101
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:19,700
<font color="yellow">You said you've never been clingy,
but you are really good at it.</font>

102
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:23,715
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so sloppy?
It's really unattractive.</font>

103
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:25,025
<font color="yellow">Senior!</font>

104
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:30,585
<font color="yellow">Hey. Go put this on my desk.</font>

105
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:32,549
<font color="yellow">Put it there carefully. Okay?</font>

106
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,237
<font color="yellow">Hey, what are you doing?</font>

107
00:09:58,237 --> 00:10:03,323
<font color="yellow">I'm working very hard on
what you told me to do, Senior.</font>

108
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:08,127
<font color="yellow">Oh, my! What are you saying?</font>

109
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:10,849
<font color="yellow">When did I tell you to do this?</font>

110
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,363
<font color="yellow">This is my work!</font>

111
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,483
<font color="yellow">Your work is my work, Senior.</font>

112
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:18,021
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

113
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:24,099
<font color="yellow">Why, you little fraud...</font>

114
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:27,200
<font color="yellow">Oh Jung Min, what are you doing?
We're supposed to head out.</font>

115
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,898
<font color="yellow">Oh, what should I do?</font>

116
00:10:29,898 --> 00:10:32,998
<font color="yellow">I have to finish this task
that Senior Ho asked me to do.</font>

117
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:36,781
<font color="yellow">Wow, Ya Ho! You're acting like a senior.</font>

118
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:39,618
<font color="yellow">- No...
- What should I do?</font>

119
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:44,728
<font color="yellow">Hey, forget about it. Go over there.</font>

120
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,328
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

121
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:49,671
<font color="yellow">Let me get this.</font>

122
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:54,465
<font color="yellow">Senior... are you mad at me?</font>

123
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:56,637
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

124
00:10:56,637 --> 00:10:59,102
<font color="yellow">I'll do it. I can finish it quickly.

your senior's work was your work too.</font>

131
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:20,772
<font color="yellow">I'll keep that in mind.</font>

132
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:29,737
<font color="yellow">Manager Kang, you don't
need to keep that in mind...</font>

134
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:36,384
