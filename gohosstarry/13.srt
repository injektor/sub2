00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,318
<font color="yellow">Yes, look at Manager Kang Tae Ho.</font>

153
00:10:13,318 --> 00:10:17,006
<font color="yellow">He's great at his job,
but his personality is awful.</font>

154
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:18,853
<font color="yellow">He seems very human though.</font>

155
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:25,716
<font color="yellow">I suppose there could be a secret reason
behind why he rejected Zeus.</font>

156
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:31,135
<font color="yellow">For example, he has an ex-girlfriend
he had a bad split with at his old job.</font>

157
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:34,596
<font color="yellow">Well, or an ex-boyfriend.</font>

158
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:37,352
<font color="yellow">That's a good one.</font>

159
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,453
<font color="yellow">Something like that.</font>

160
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,699
<font color="yellow">It's hard for me to get to talk to you
unless I have to bother you like this.</font>

161
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:48,588
<font color="yellow">You said you would
call yesterday, but you didn't.</font>

162
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:50,435
<font color="yellow">I don't think that's
the problem right now.</font>

163
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:51,565
<font color="yellow">I had no choice.</font>

164
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:53,473
<font color="yellow">She came to the building.</font>

165
00:10:53,473 --> 00:10:56,054
<font color="yellow">I ran right into her, so what
was I supposed to do? Ignore her?</font>

166
00:10:56,054 --> 00:10:58,617
<font color="yellow">You ignored me just fine.
Why can't you ignore my mom?</font>

167
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,486
<font color="yellow">You two have nothing
to do with one another.</font>

168
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:04,395
<font color="yellow">I don't want this happening again.</font>

169
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:08,553
<font color="yellow">Were you with...</font>

170
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:10,777
<font color="yellow">Manager Kang Tae Ho yesterday?</font>

171
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,775
<font color="yellow">Is that a question you're
asking me as my boss?</font>

172
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:17,046
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.</font>

173
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:21,010
<font color="yellow">It seems like you haven't fully
comprehended what I've said yet.</font>

174
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,106
<font color="yellow">Working with you is very,
very uncomfortable for me.</font>

175
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:26,973
<font color="yellow">I'm just enduring it
because of this job crisis.</font>

176
00:11:26,973 --> 00:11:30,281
<font color="yellow">So, don't make things
more difficult for me.</font>

177
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:33,814
<font color="yellow">Please keep your distance from me.</font>

178
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:36,102
<font color="yellow">- Why do I have to?
- Why can't you?</font>

179
00:11:36,102 --> 00:11:37,362
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

180
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:42,993
<font color="yellow">felt like I was going to die,
when you left me, all of a sudden.</font>

181
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:48,310
<font color="yellow">I am barely... really
just barely holding on.</font>

182
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,574
<font color="yellow">Why are you showing up like
nothing happened and asking me that?</font>

183
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,199
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say to you.</font>

184
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,212
<font color="yellow">Oh, and I don't have to answer you.</font>

185
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:03,049
<font color="yellow">When I asked you why we had to break up,
you never gave me an answer.</font>

186
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,881
<font color="yellow">Even if you don't know why
you have to, just accept it.</font>

187
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:32,181
<font color="yellow">I should really control my temper.</font>

188
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,017
<font color="yellow">Was that too much?</font>

189
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:36,237
<font color="yellow">He won't know.</font>

190
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,011
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

191
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:45,522
<font color="yellow">I was thinking about your advice.
Thinking for three seconds before I act.</font>

192
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:50,642
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

193
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:53,875
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure that I'll ever be able
to fix this personality of mine.</font>

194
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:57,602
<font color="yellow">What can you do? You just have
to live your life the way you are.</font>

195
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:01,183
<font color="yellow">I have too many regrets to do that.</font>

196
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:05,939
<font color="yellow">Manager!</font>

197
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:08,750
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to console me
and tell me that I'm not so bad.</font>

198
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,289
<font color="yellow">Why? I can't deny the truth.</font>

199
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:14,260
<font color="yellow">You're quick to act,
thoughtless, and simple.</font>

200
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,746
<font color="yellow">It makes sense that
you'd have lots of regrets.</font>

201
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:17,976
<font color="yellow">Geez...</font>

202
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:21,445
<font color="yellow">What do you plan on doing?</font>

203
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:24,737
<font color="yellow">I'm going to visit Section Chief.
He wants to have some fruit.</font>

204
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,930
<font color="yellow">He only broke one arm.
Can't he eat them on his own?</font>

205
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,122
<font color="yellow">That works.</font>

206
00:13:28,122 --> 00:13:30,805
<font color="yellow">I'll skip my meeting and pick you up
when you're done.</font>

207
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,708
<font color="yellow">You're going to pick me up?</font>

208
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,155
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at? Look away.</font>

209
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:11,289
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you're here, Go Ho.</font>

210
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:13,150
<font color="yellow">It's a nice house, right?</font>

211
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:19,920
<font color="yellow">Want to see pictures?
This is the girl who lives with me.</font>

212
00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:24,939
<font color="yellow">Section Chief, you have a girlfriend?</font>

213
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,237
<font color="yellow">Do you have a wife?</font>

214
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:30,492
<font color="yellow">Look at how shocked you are.
She's my niece.</font>

215
00:14:30,492 --> 00:14:32,931
<font color="yellow">My older brother and I
have a huge difference in age.</font>

216
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:35,700
<font color="yellow">If you saw us in passing,
we'd look like a couple, right?</font>

217
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,635
<font color="yellow">I do look very young for my age.</font>

218
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:39,891
<font color="yellow">You live with your niece?</font>

219
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:42,495
<font color="yellow">Live with her? I raised her by myself.</font>

220
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:47,348
<font color="yellow">My brother passed away.
So what could I do?</font>

221
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:48,649
<font color="yellow">I had to raise her.</font>

222
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:50,740
<font color="yellow">She's my child.</font>

223
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:57,678
<font color="yellow">Section Chief... you're a better man
than I thought you were.</font>

224
00:14:57,678 --> 00:15:00,549
<font color="yellow">Forget it. You told me
that I'm not that great.</font>

225
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:03,218
<font color="yellow">Better than I thought!
Better than I thought, okay?</font>

226
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:04,858
<font color="yellow">Better than you thought?</font>

227
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:08,819
<font color="yellow">Everyone has good sides and bad sides!</font>

228
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:12,026
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I suppose there needs
to be a guy like me around.</font>

229
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:14,530
<font color="yellow">Everything about me
isn't so great either.</font>

230
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,612
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

231
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:18,269
<font color="yellow">Everything about you is great, Ya Ho.</font>

232
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:27,652
<font color="yellow">It hurts... It hurts!</font>

233
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:35,717
<font color="yellow">- Bye, now.
- Okay.</font>

234
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:38,453
<font color="yellow">Section Chief, you really are the best.</font>

235
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:41,918
<font color="yellow">I saw a different side of you today.</font>

236
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:46,598
<font color="yellow">I want to become someone
who takes responsibility, like you.</font>

237
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:50,819
<font color="yellow">You are very cool. The best, the best!</font>

238
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,218
<font color="yellow">Then, enjoy the fruit.</font>

239
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:56,266
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- See you at work tomorrow.</font>

240
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,342
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

241
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,165
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

242
00:16:07,181 --> 00:16:08,958
<font color="yellow">See you at work!</font>

243
00:16:10,988 --> 00:16:12,106
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

244
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:36,481
<font color="yellow">Ya Ho!</font>

245
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:39,050
<font color="yellow">Ho, let's eat dinner together!</font>

246
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,833
<font color="yellow">Let's... have meat...</font>

247
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:52,633
<font color="yellow">Section Chief.</font>

248
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:55,853
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

249
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:57,785
<font color="yellow">Manager Kang.</font>

250
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:04,881
<font color="yellow">But... what brings you here?</font>

251
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,414
<font color="yellow">I was just passing by.</font>

252
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:11,948
<font color="yellow">- Passing by?
- Yes.</font>

253
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,891
<font color="yellow">Then, was he passing by too?</font>
