51
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,450

69
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:04,172
<font color="yellow">I was thinking about it,
and I think I'm a really decent guy.</font>

somewhere before.</font>

00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:25,284
<font color="yellow">Don't trust that stuff.
It's just an article.</font>

75
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:28,465
<font color="yellow">No, this writer is a bit different.</font>

76
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:32,354
<font color="yellow">It really got me
in the heart, right here.</font>

77
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:36,193
<font color="yellow">Stop poking yourself there
and poke the meat, will you?</font>

78
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:37,609
<font color="yellow">Give me that thing.</font>

79
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:44,794
<font color="yellow">Go Ho, don't you want to
teach me what real love is?</font>

80
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,263
<font color="yellow">Teaching isn't a hobby of mine.</font>

81
00:06:49,753 --> 00:06:51,703
<font color="yellow">Should I tell you how to get rid of me?</font>

97

<font color="yellow">Why? Can't I eat them too?</font>

98
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:32,964
<font color="yellow">It doesn't suit you.</font>

100
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,821

151
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:53,968
<font color="yellow">He's been studying a long time, nothing
was working out, so he needed some air.</font>

152
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:57,878
<font color="yellow">That's how men are. I'm sure he's fine.</font>

153
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,493
<font color="yellow">No, I was really mean to him.</font>

154
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:04,498
<font color="yellow">I wanted to hurt him
because I didn't want to see him.</font>

155
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,138
<font color="yellow">What makes it even worse is...</font>

156
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,846
<font color="yellow">I meant everything I said.</font>

157
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,614
<font color="yellow">Why am I so mean?</font>

158
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:31,377
<font color="yellow">What if Kang is dead somewhere?</font>

159
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,018
<font color="yellow">He's so nice...</font>

160
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:39,957
<font color="yellow">Is there anywhere he might go
around here? Should we go look?</font>

161
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:57,220
<font color="yellow">Kang! Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

162
00:14:58,545 --> 00:15:00,932
<font color="yellow">- Kang!
- I'm not him.</font>

163
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:12,726
<font color="yellow">What should I do now?</font>

164
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:14,591
<font color="yellow">He's not here.</font>

165
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:15,719
<font color="yellow"><i>Go Kang?</i></font>

166
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:18,142
<font color="yellow">Hey! Let's go!</font>

167
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:20,521
<font color="yellow">Let's go home!</font>

168
00:15:20,521 --> 00:15:23,548
<font color="yellow">With his personality, he's probably okay.</font>

169
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,138
<font color="yellow">But Go Ho must be very scared.</font>

170
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,489
<font color="yellow">Are you going to go?</font>

171
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,340
<font color="yellow">Kang is a good drinker.</font>

172
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:36,821
<font color="yellow">I drank with him
a few times, I know it.</font>

173
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:40,541
<font color="yellow">He didn't want to worry his mom,
so his family probably doesn't know.</font>

174
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:43,389
<font color="yellow">Look in the bars around the area.</font>

175
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:45,701
<font color="yellow">Have you changed your position?</font>

176
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:54,065
<font color="yellow">My position is not working out...
right now.</font>

177
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:15,757
<font color="yellow"><i>Ya Ho!</i></font>

178
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:24,898
<font color="yellow">What's an area with a lot of bars?</font>

179
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:27,281
<font color="yellow">Go Kang doesn't like to drink.</font>

180
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:30,909
<font color="yellow">He eats udon noodles from street vendors
or goes to the comic book shop.</font>

181
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:34,239
<font color="yellow">Or he plays with pigeons in the park.</font>

182
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:36,604
<font color="yellow">You don't know.</font>

183
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,792
<font color="yellow"><i>Look in the bars around the area.</i></font>

184
00:16:39,273 --> 00:16:41,292
<font color="yellow">At a time like this,
he might want to drink.</font>

185
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,047
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

186
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:00,864
<font color="yellow">What's he doing?</font>

187
00:17:00,864 --> 00:17:02,850
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Is he praying?</font>

188
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:09,563
<font color="yellow">They do that in temples, right?</font>

189
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:13,155
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

190
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,497
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming now?</font>

191
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,783
<font color="yellow">Oh, Dad.</font>

192
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:23,927
<font color="yellow">What took you so long?</font>

193
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:28,532
<font color="yellow">Oh, my...</font>

194
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:47,747
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kang!</font>

195
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:50,262
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

196
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:57,007
<font color="yellow">You get up right now!
Pull yourself together.</font>

197
00:17:57,007 --> 00:18:00,439
<font color="yellow">Seriously, what are you
doing with your life?</font>

198
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:05,974
<font color="yellow">That's enough!</font>

199
00:18:05,974 --> 00:18:09,403
<font color="yellow">Leave me alone! I'm going to turn
that guy into a human being!</font>

200
00:18:09,403 --> 00:18:10,665
<font color="yellow">Get over here!</font>

201
00:18:15,058 --> 00:18:16,250
<font color="yellow">Get over here.</font>

202
00:18:18,343 --> 00:18:19,618
