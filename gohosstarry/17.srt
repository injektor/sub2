to do a commercial.</font>

152
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:19,351
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

153
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:21,687
<font color="yellow">Client meeting.</font>

154
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:22,851
<font color="yellow">That's unfortunate.</font>

155
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:27,523
<font color="yellow">Sometimes things get accomplished
during meetings, sometimes they don't.</font>

156
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:28,818
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

157
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,558
<font color="yellow">If the meeting is over, I'll get going.</font>

158
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:37,153
<font color="yellow">Do you like Manager Kang Tae Ho?</font>

159
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:41,549
<font color="yellow">You saw everything.</font>

160
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:43,775
<font color="yellow">I saw that Manager Kang likes you.</font>

161
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:47,716
<font color="yellow">Do you like him too?</font>

162
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:53,848
<font color="yellow">- I thought about it and--
- Do you know?</font>

163
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:56,918
<font color="yellow">When you were dating me,
you hated Manager Kang.</font>

164
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:58,654
<font color="yellow">You hated him to death.</font>

165
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:01,739
<font color="yellow">You even made a hate doll of him
that you would stick needles into.</font>

166
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,467
<font color="yellow">If you ended up liking him after that...</font>

167
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:18,346
<font color="yellow">you can start liking me too.</font>

168
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:22,365
<font color="yellow">I'll make that happen.</font>

169
00:14:22,365 --> 00:14:24,963
<font color="yellow">Don't... it's over.</font>

170
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:30,148
<font color="yellow">Whatever your reason was...</font>

171
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:31,148
<font color="yellow">it's over.</font>

172
00:14:31,148 --> 00:14:32,732
<font color="yellow">We can start over.</font>

173
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:35,683
<font color="yellow">We didn't break up
because we didn't like each other.</font>

174
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:40,332
<font color="yellow">If I wasn't stupid enough to let you go,
we would be together right now.</font>

175
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:42,963
<font color="yellow">We'll be happy if we start over too.</font>

176
00:14:42,963 --> 00:14:44,260
<font color="yellow">I'll get going first.</font>

177
00:15:02,622 --> 00:15:05,256
<font color="yellow">Don't do this.
You're not this kind of person.</font>

178
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:07,350
<font color="yellow">I don't know what kind of person I am.</font>

179
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:18,937
<font color="yellow">Drinking tea was enough for today.</font>

180
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,963
<font color="yellow">Manager, you're leaving too?</font>

181
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:13,143
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

182
00:17:14,124 --> 00:17:16,754
<font color="yellow">Then, where are you going?</font>

183
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:19,330
<font color="yellow">I'm going to drive you home.</font>

184
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,044
<font color="yellow">I can tell that you're trying to avoid
being left alone with me.</font>

185
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:27,021
<font color="yellow">I want to be with you,
even if it's just for a moment.</font>

186
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:29,957
<font color="yellow">I'm just...</font>

187
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:31,047
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

188
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,809
<font color="yellow">Do you not know that
I'm not asking you anything?</font>

189
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:44,572
<font color="yellow">I'm trying hard to leave you
with a good impression.</font>

190
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:47,783
<font color="yellow">I don't just lose my temper.</font>

191
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:50,024
<font color="yellow">Take a good look at me.</font>

192
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:51,547
<font color="yellow">I can hold in my temper.</font>

193
00:17:54,302 --> 00:17:58,431
<font color="yellow">I can wait, without asking or demanding.</font>

194
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:02,782
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- No.</font>

195
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:05,461
<font color="yellow">No, no. I can do it.</font>

196
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:06,830
<font color="yellow">No...</font>

197
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:11,286
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

198
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:14,698
<font color="yellow">I can cling onto you if you need me to.</font>

199
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:25,638
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

200
00:18:27,734 --> 00:18:29,825
<font color="yellow">don't think about anything else.</font>

201
00:18:31,306 --> 00:18:32,696
<font color="yellow">Take a good look at me.</font>

202
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:40,709
<font color="yellow">Just me.</font>

203
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:44,277
<font color="yellow">Look only at me.</font>
