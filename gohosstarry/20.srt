it's right to choose this account.</font>

87

88

<font color="yellow">How are you not sentimental at all?</font>

89
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:25,860
<font color="yellow">It doesn't put food on the table.</font>

90
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,579
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why you're conflicted.</font>

91
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:31,401
<font color="yellow">Sir, of course,
this is the right choice.</font>

92
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:37,932
<font color="yellow">Still, they can't be without us.</font>

93
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:40,759
<font color="yellow">I think they can go
with someone else, besides us.</font>

94
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:44,375

96
00:08:47,264 --> 00:08:49,864

this is the obvious choice.</font>

97
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:52,504
<font color="yellow">Why are you stalling, not choosing,
and making them angry?</font>

98
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:54,096
<font color="yellow">Are they angry?</font>

99
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:56,729

Look at this situation.</font>

100
