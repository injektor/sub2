too much work?</font>

to do too, Director Kim.</font>

154
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:48,111

156
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:57,033
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I have to go, baby.</font>

157
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:00,564
<font color="yellow">I can't beat Manager Kang.</font>

158
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:02,351
<font color="yellow">He has a personality like a madman.</font>

159

- Okay.</font>

160
00:12:05,481 --> 00:12:08,544
<font color="yellow">All right! Let's get to work.</font>

has the meanest temper of them all.</i></font>

162
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,448
<font color="yellow"><i>But the reason that people
think so highly of him is...</i></font>

163
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:19,678
<font color="yellow"><i>he's fair. He doesn't discriminate.
Everyone gets a bite of his mean temper!</i></font>

164
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:27,409
<font color="yellow">Whenever I see him, I feel suffocated,
like I'm being strangled.</font>

165
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:30,154
<font color="yellow">It's because of your necklace.
You made it too tight.</font>

166
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:32,194
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

167
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:36,737

He doesn't do anything!</font>

- I'm okay now.</font>

169

porridge because of me.</font>

170
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:45,233
<font color="yellow">It's not because of you.</font>

171
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:47,624
<font color="yellow">We all get sick when we see him.</font>

172
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:49,744

with Manager Hwang, right?</font>

175
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:11,795
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

176
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:13,895

177
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:16,374
<font color="yellow"><i>Let us eat in peace.</i></font>

178
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,509
<font color="yellow">I should have treated you guys
to dinner before this.</font>

179

subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

180
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:25,997
<font color="yellow">That's why I'll be treating
all of you guys today.</font>

181
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:29,417
<font color="yellow">Wow! I feel like my cold is disappearing.</font>

182
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:32,967
<font color="yellow">Senior Go Ho! Manager Hwang
is treating us to lunch!</font>

183
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:35,664
<font color="yellow">That's nice.</font>

184
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:51,601
<font color="yellow">Oh! Are you okay?</font>

185
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,520
<font color="yellow">What!</font>

186
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,500
<font color="yellow">That was Manager Hwang,
not Oh Jung Min?</font>

187
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,337
<font color="yellow">Wow, awesome!</font>

188
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:09,125
<font color="yellow">Now I've seen everything!
Our company idol likes you?</font>

189
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,577
<font color="yellow">Our company idol?</font>

190
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:12,995

193
00:14:20,095 --> 00:14:21,810
<font color="yellow">He's not my style.</font>

194
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:25,601
<font color="yellow">I guess people all go
through the same thing.</font>

195
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:27,771
<font color="yellow">There must be a madman in every office.</font>

196
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:32,418
<font color="yellow">How could he be so similar
to the one in our office though?</font>

197
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:34,129
<font color="yellow">What's the name of this webzine?</font>

198
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:35,948
<font color="yellow">- "Starry Night."
- Awesome.</font>

199
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:37,293
<font color="yellow">It is, right?</font>

200
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,239
<font color="yellow">I thought maybe it was
a prophecy or something.</font>

201
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:41,129
<font color="yellow">This is amazing.</font>

202
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:43,372

205
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:52,906
<font color="yellow">He has a crazy temper,
and when he glares at you...</font>

206
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:55,131

- Who else, who?</font>

207
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:56,544

about another company!</font>

209
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:04,885
<font color="yellow">I guess there must be a boss
there with a really bad temper!</font>

210
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:07,297
<font color="yellow">Yeah?</font>

211
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:10,038
<font color="yellow">It's a relief that we don't
have anyone like that here.</font>

212
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:12,259
<font color="yellow">- You're right.
- Yes!</font>

213
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,480
<font color="yellow">So right!</font>

214
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480

<font color="yellow">You can't handle it yourself?</font>

222
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,006
<font color="yellow">Hang up now.</font>

223
00:15:45,817 --> 00:15:50,071
<font color="yellow">By the way, are you guys talking about
another company during work hours?</font>

224
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:52,290
<font color="yellow">- No, no, no!
- No, of course not!</font>

225
