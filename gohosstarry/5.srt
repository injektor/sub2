<font color="yellow"><i>That's all I can say to you. Sorry.</i></font>

151
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:45,429
<font color="yellow"><i>Saying thank you, saying sorry.</i></font>

152
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:50,231
<font color="yellow"><i>Basic manners of work life.</i></font>

153
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:53,877
<font color="yellow"><i>But they can sound like curse words
when you hear them from an ex-boyfriend.</i></font>

154
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:59,340
<font color="yellow"><i>If he was always thankful to me,
why did he break up with me?</i></font>

155
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,279
<font color="yellow"><i>Why is that all he can say to me?</i></font>

156
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:06,369
<font color="yellow">What does he want?</font>

157
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:09,890
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

158
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,598
<font color="yellow">So it is you, Senior Ho.</font>

159
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:25,776
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

160
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:28,377
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

161
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:55,645
<font color="yellow">All day... wow.</font>

162
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:59,634
<font color="yellow">Manager Kang was picking on me.
I didn't even have time to eat.</font>

163
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:01,135
<font color="yellow">I thought I was going to die.</font>

164
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:03,199
<font color="yellow">How did you manage to survive, Senior Ho?</font>

165
00:14:03,914 --> 00:14:07,458
<font color="yellow">If you get me started, talking about it,
you won't be able to go home tonight.</font>

166
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,534
<font color="yellow">I don't have to go.</font>

167
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:11,654
<font color="yellow"><i>Does he know?</i></font>

168
00:14:14,684 --> 00:14:15,885
<font color="yellow"><i>He knows!</i></font>

169
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:24,465
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say,
get to the point.</font>

170
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:28,170
<font color="yellow">I despise people who talk in circles and
try to get a feel for the other person.</font>

171
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:34,153
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll get straight to the point.</font>

172
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:35,530
<font color="yellow">I like it that way too.</font>

173
00:14:57,442 --> 00:14:58,891
<font color="yellow">You should eat this.</font>

174
00:14:58,891 --> 00:15:00,980
<font color="yellow">You look very hungry.</font>

175
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,271
<font color="yellow">I'm not hungry.</font>

176
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:08,631
<font color="yellow">Were you really home last night?</font>

177
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:11,250
<font color="yellow">- And if I wasn't?
- If you weren't...</font>

178
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:14,749
<font color="yellow">that would be a good thing.</font>

179
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,390
<font color="yellow">I think I would like that.</font>

180
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,217
<font color="yellow">I think I'm going to
start liking you, Senior.</font>

181
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:39,943
<font color="yellow">You need to dress warmly.
They say women need to stay warm.</font>

182
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:41,290
<font color="yellow">See you at work tomorrow.</font>

183
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:57,922
<font color="yellow"><i>I told him to get straight to the point
and it hit me harder than I expected!</i></font>

184
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,518
<font color="yellow"><i>Jung Min: You have eat that with milk.</i></font>

185
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:19,986
<font color="yellow"><i>Warm it up before you eat it.</i></font>

186
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,409
<font color="yellow">Senior.</font>

187
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,121
<font color="yellow">Do you want some coffee too?</font>

188
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:48,150
<font color="yellow"><i>Exterior.</i></font>

189
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,420
<font color="yellow"><i>The confidence to get
straight to the point.</i></font>

190
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,591
<font color="yellow"><i>Is a party boy capable
of showing sincerity too?</i></font>

191
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:44,011
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- <i>Yeah?</i></font>

192
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:45,969
<font color="yellow">Manager Kang, it's Go Ho.</font>

193
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:48,771
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I was able
to resolve everything.</font>

194
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:51,511
<font color="yellow">- I'll buy coffee tomorrow.
- <i>I'm out, bye.</i></font>

195
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:55,410
<font color="yellow">Hello? Hello...</font>

196
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,163
<font color="yellow">Oh, my!</font>

197
00:17:58,163 --> 00:18:02,108
<font color="yellow">What kind of phone mannerism is that?
This good-for-nothing loser!</font>

198
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:05,159
<font color="yellow">I've never seen such a rude bastard
in my entire life!</font>

199
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:09,112
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

200
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:19,052
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

201
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:27,005
<font color="yellow">If I knew you were coming, Manager Kang,
I would have kept Go Ho here.</font>

202
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,408
<font color="yellow">No, I'm sure that she had
her own things to do.</font>

203
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:34,869
<font color="yellow">Still, I feel bad that I sent her home
after all we did was talk business.</font>

204
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:36,948
<font color="yellow">I should've kept her around a bit longer.</font>

205
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:39,134
<font color="yellow">What unfortunate timing...</font>

206
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:43,060
<font color="yellow">Why don't we go get a drink, at least?</font>

207
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,810
<font color="yellow">Okay? Okay?</font>

208
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,964
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

209
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:52,359
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here without calling?
Did you come because of Go Ho?</font>

210
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,563
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

211
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:55,457
<font color="yellow">Then, did you come to see me?</font>

212
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,253
<font color="yellow">Let's just say I came to see Ho.</font>

213
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:01,111
<font color="yellow">Geez, you're so stingy
with your feelings.</font>

214
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:19,137

- What are you doing?</i></font>

216
00:19:21,178 --> 00:19:22,768
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh, my!</i></font>

217
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,162
<font color="yellow"><i>Senior Go Ho, Manager Hwang

<font color="yellow"><i>It's not Manager Hwang Ji Hoon,
but it's Oh Jung Min?</i></font>

219
00:19:30,727 --> 00:19:33,141
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you still have feelings
for Manager Hwang Ji Hoon?</i></font>

220
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:35,700
<font color="yellow"><i>Because you are my woman.</i></font>
