101
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:42,534
<font color="yellow">Then I will teach her.</font>

102
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:47,646
<font color="yellow">Now that you mention it,
I wanted to talk to you about Promise.</font>

103
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:54,386

reporting to you, Manager Kang?</font>

104
00:08:54,386 --> 00:08:59,005

110

for me to switch teams.</font>

129

you chose the wrong person.</font>

148
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:01,047
<font color="yellow">Manager Kang is tall but he can't fight!</font>

149
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,160
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yeah.</font>

150
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,833
<font color="yellow">- I want to change mine.
- He has a strong name though.</font>

151
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,831
<font color="yellow">Height is nothing, and I've seen
Manager Hwang's body.</font>

152
00:13:07,831 --> 00:13:09,074
<font color="yellow">- He has muscles.
- What the heck?</font>

153
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:11,842
<font color="yellow">- When did you see that?
- I'm married, I'm married.</font>

154
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:15,400
<font color="yellow">I have special powers.</font>

155
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,920
<font color="yellow">You are so disciplined.</font>

156
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,640
<font color="yellow">You really are.</font>

157
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,717

time to relax like this.</i></font>

158
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:26,346
<font color="yellow">He has muscles like you wouldn't expect.</font>

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,913

00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:31,465

172
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:48,931
<font color="yellow">Oh, stretching! I want to do it too.</font>

173
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,962
<font color="yellow">Do it for me. Do it for me.</font>

174
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:56,072
<font color="yellow">Hurry, hurry. My spine hurts so much.</font>

175
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:59,332
<font color="yellow">My back hurts so much.
Yeah, stretch it, stretch it.</font>

176
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,312
<font color="yellow">I wasn't slacking off!</font>

go home, I stayed at work.</font>

179
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,699
<font color="yellow">We're going to the studio.
Shut your mouth and follow me.</font>

180
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,821
<font color="yellow">What about the project plan?</font>

181
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:37,223
<font color="yellow">I'm working on it.</font>

182
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:41,246
<font color="yellow">I still think the other one was better.</font>

183
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,601
<font color="yellow">- Is it a cold?
- What?</font>

184
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:51,644
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

185
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:54,292

186
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:03,519
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

187
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,593
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

188
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:09,520
<font color="yellow">I'm busy enough, as it is.
What if I catch your cold?</font>

189
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,521
<font color="yellow">You should've said this earlier.</font>

190
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:14,750
<font color="yellow">Wait... I did tell you.</font>

191
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,928
<font color="yellow">Go home and sleep.</font>

192

health is part of being a professional?</font>

00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,472
<font color="yellow">When will you learn
to be a human? Get out.</font>

194
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,174
<font color="yellow">Get out!</font>

195
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,350
<font color="yellow">That jerk!</font>

196
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,351
<font color="yellow">A person is dying of a cold
and all you care about is yourself?</font>

197
00:16:48,403 --> 00:16:51,462
<font color="yellow">You're a long way from
being a human being, yourself.</font>

198
00:16:56,168 --> 00:16:58,510
<font color="yellow">But there is something you don't know.</font>

199
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:03,300
<font color="yellow">This is my neighborhood.</font>

200
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,069
<font color="yellow">You basically drove me home, dummy.</font>

201
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,186
<font color="yellow">Dummy.</font>

202
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,612
<font color="yellow">Are you sure this is good for me?</font>

203
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:30,234
<font color="yellow">Of course! Your back will be much better!</font>

204
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,538
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I think it's really getting better!</font>

205
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,206
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do the next part.</font>

206
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,824

- Yes?</font>

00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:56,457

209
00:17:57,365 --> 00:18:00,605

took her to the studio.</font>

210

he would be here soon. Where is he?</font>
