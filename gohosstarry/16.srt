57
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:58,371

68

69

70

- No you won't</font>

<font color="yellow">I'll buy it.</font>

129
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:09,979

135
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,459
<font color="yellow">Why would you sigh
like that in my nice car?</font>

136
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:01,799
<font color="yellow">That's just how life is.</font>

or it can be that way.</font>

138

139
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:10,308
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?
Lots of things work out for you.</font>

140
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:12,322
<font color="yellow">You have too many things,
and that's your problem.</font>

141
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:16,257
<font color="yellow">It's all the same when it passes.</font>

142

after time passed.</i></font>

- What is that?</font>

147
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:50,434
<font color="yellow">I'm cold.</font>

148
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:52,780
