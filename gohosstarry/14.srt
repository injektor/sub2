42

43
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:36,559

listen to Section Chief.</font>

<font color="yellow">He's such a foul man...</font>

51
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:07,802
<font color="yellow">I know that's what you might be thinking.</font>

52

to your superiors.</font>

56
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:20,793

I haven't been exercising</font>

my niece's tuition is?</font>

62
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:50,642

Would you like a full exam?</font>

147
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:34,392
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

148
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:36,613
<font color="yellow">I can just leave then, right?</font>

149
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,983
<font color="yellow">Someone called from your office.</font>

150
00:11:38,983 --> 00:11:42,444
<font color="yellow">We picked up and explained the situation.
Someone is picking you up.</font>

151
00:11:42,444 --> 00:11:43,882
<font color="yellow">Please wait a little bit.</font>

152
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:46,292
<font color="yellow">My office? Picking me up?</font>

153
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:47,498
<font color="yellow">Who is?</font>

154
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,704
<font color="yellow">He said he was a manager.</font>

155
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:53,036
<font color="yellow">Where's my phone?</font>

156
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:04,579
<font color="yellow">It's a company number.</font>

157
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,353
<font color="yellow">Manager?</font>

158
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:14,051
<font color="yellow">Who's going to come?</font>

159
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:33,872
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

160
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:36,608
<font color="yellow">What a shock...</font>

161
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:46,143
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

162
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:48,003
<font color="yellow">Where's Go Ho?</font>

163
00:12:48,003 --> 00:12:51,670
<font color="yellow">The hospital called earlier
and said that she got sick.</font>

164
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,814
<font color="yellow">She's sick?</font>

165
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:21,927
<font color="yellow"><i>If you think about it</i></font>

166
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:26,507
<font color="yellow"><i>of course, another person
wouldn't know how I feel.</i></font>

167
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:30,179
<font color="yellow"><i>Sometimes, I don't know how I feel.</i></font>

168
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,719
<font color="yellow"><i>Right now...</i></font>

169
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,718
<font color="yellow"><i>I am waiting for the person
who will open that door.</i></font>

170
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:41,626
<font color="yellow"><i>I don't even know who
it's going to be, but I'm waiting.</i></font>

171
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,086
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

172
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:09,429
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the ride home.</font>

173
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:13,353
<font color="yellow">I'll rest today, I'll get better,
and I'll be at work tomorrow.</font>

174
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,036
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

175
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:25,537
<font color="yellow">Later. I'm going inside.</font>

176
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:33,945
<font color="yellow">- Ho.
- Don't!</font>

177
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:37,907
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk today. Just go.</font>

178
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:41,314
<font color="yellow">Let's talk today.</font>

179
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,573
<font color="yellow">Are we going to keep
being awkward like this?</font>

180
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:48,156
<font color="yellow">If we talk now, I think that
I'll say some terrible things.</font>

181
00:14:48,156 --> 00:14:53,704
<font color="yellow">But I've acted terribly enough today.</font>

182
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:55,401
<font color="yellow">So, just leave.</font>

183
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:57,642
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be terrible.</font>

184
00:15:00,343 --> 00:15:01,617
<font color="yellow">You can be.</font>

185
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:03,267
<font color="yellow">I don't want to!</font>

186
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,204
<font color="yellow">Seriously, why are you being like this?</font>

187
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,079
<font color="yellow">You can stay the terrible jerk
in our relationship!</font>

188
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:11,088
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting so cool about this?</font>

189
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:15,170
<font color="yellow">You were the one who won me over,
and then stabbed me with a knife!</font>

190
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,777
<font color="yellow">Why are you making me out
to be the petty one now?</font>

191
00:15:17,777 --> 00:15:19,872
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

192
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:27,311
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

193
00:15:28,222 --> 00:15:31,704
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I was wrong, Ho.</font>

194

<font color="yellow"><i>It's the people you love the most,
that say things that hurt you the most.</i></font>

195
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:40,358
<font color="yellow"><i>That's what they say.</i></font>

196
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:47,541
<font color="yellow"><i>Who did this person get hurt by,
that they came to this painful epiphany?</i></font>

197
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:02,009
<font color="yellow">Ho.</font>

198
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:07,060
<font color="yellow">No. Oh.</font>

199
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,550
<font color="yellow">When are you going back
to get pictures of the theme park?</font>

200
00:16:15,482 --> 00:16:17,518
<font color="yellow">Senior Ho is sick.</font>

201
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,690
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

202
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,470
<font color="yellow">It seemed like she was really stressed
when we were drinking yesterday.</font>

203
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,599
<font color="yellow">She passed out suddenly,
and went to the hospital.</font>

204
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,690
<font color="yellow">Passed out?</font>

205
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,977
<font color="yellow">How bad was it?</font>

206
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:39,336
<font color="yellow">Manager Hwang went to pick her up.</font>
