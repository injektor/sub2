was really not great.</font>

how can you side against a co-worker?</font>

<font color="yellow">Who are you accusing of taking sides?</font>

84

- Ah.</font>

86

<font color="yellow">You should never have come here.</font>

91
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:34,729
<font color="yellow">Why bother asking now?</font>

92
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:44,154
<font color="yellow">Do you hate me that much?</font>

93
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:46,315
<font color="yellow">I hate you.</font>

94
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:09,839
<font color="yellow">Ah, should we try
switching out the production?</font>

95
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,450
<font color="yellow">Unless we completely change the mood,
this is the best we can do.</font>

96

would be better.</font>

97

- Yes?</font>

104
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,576

105
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:45,103
<font color="yellow">I'm going to head out now.</font>

106
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:48,392
<font color="yellow">I want you to photocopy this.</font>

107
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:03,622
<font color="yellow">Do you need anything else?</font>

108
00:09:09,877 --> 00:09:11,309
<font color="yellow">One moment.</font>

00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:14,366
<font color="yellow">How about we do a love story?</font>

120
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,515
<font color="yellow">- Love story?
- Yes.</font>

121
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:22,044
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest. Women in their 20s
and 30s are won over by romance.</font>

122
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:27,339
<font color="yellow">A woman has been dumped by her boyfriend
and that woman has been lifted up by...</font>

123
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:30,685
<font color="yellow">Promise.</font>

124
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:38,201
<font color="yellow"><i>After her break up,
she was wounded deeply.</i></font>

125
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:40,604
<font color="yellow"><i>She puts it all behind her.</i></font>

126
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,680
<font color="yellow"><i>She puts on her Promise gear
and she starts to run!</i></font>

127
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:51,824
<font color="yellow"><i>Her frayed breath, her sweat,
her second wind.</i></font>

128
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:53,682
<font color="yellow"><i>And at the end...</i></font>

129
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:57,364
<font color="yellow"><i>her boyfriend is waiting for her.</i></font>

130
00:11:57,364 --> 00:12:01,959
<font color="yellow">He spreads his arms open wide
and... "Honey"!</font>

131
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,124
<font color="yellow">Promise.</font>

132
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:06,618
<font color="yellow">What a freaking joke.</font>

133
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:14,749
<font color="yellow">What kind of dumb concept is that?</font>

134
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:17,318
<font color="yellow">Geez... this isn't 1988.</font>

135
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:18,973
<font color="yellow">It's so awful!</font>

136
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:23,533
<font color="yellow">Why? Using romance gets us halfway there.</font>

137
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:27,325
<font color="yellow">If women are the target,
this is how you have to do it.</font>

138
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:32,080
<font color="yellow">A man that was lacking dumps a girl.
She starts to run, and she wears Promise.</font>

144
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,610
<font color="yellow"><i>What is that?</i></font>

145
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,536
<font color="yellow">Women also like being
committed to one man.</font>

146
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:01,925
<font color="yellow">Statistics show this, okay?</font>

147
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:05,994
<font color="yellow">Even women don't like to see
women with lots of other men.</font>

148
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,022
<font color="yellow">They see that in a negative light.
They dislike it.</font>

149
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:10,424
<font color="yellow">No, no. You are very mistaken.</font>

150
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:12,266
<font color="yellow">Just think about it.</font>

151
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:14,560
<font color="yellow">Whatever the case,
he's a man who dumped me.</font>

152
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,232
<font color="yellow">He turned his back on me.</font>

153
00:13:16,232 --> 00:13:17,502
<font color="yellow">His reasons don't matter.</font>

154
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:20,425
<font color="yellow">He turned away from me,
neglected me, and abandoned me!</font>

155
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,814
<font color="yellow">A man who declared that
he didn't care what happened to me.</font>

156
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:25,016
<font color="yellow">Is the woman stupid?
Why would she go back to him?</font>

157
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:27,671
<font color="yellow">Still, how can love change?</font>

158
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,845
<font color="yellow">Why do you think that love
in a woman can't change?</font>

159
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:34,689
<font color="yellow">Then you should be good to her!
Women like men who are good to them too.</font>

160
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,141
<font color="yellow">I like guys who treat me well too!</font>

161
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:39,379
<font color="yellow">Don't think that a woman
will stand by and do nothing!</font>

162
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:45,667
<font color="yellow">We're talking about
the commercial... right?</font>

163
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,237
<font color="yellow">Manager Hwang?</font>

164
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:53,408
<font color="yellow">I'm still having lingering feelings.</font>

165
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:57,828
<font color="yellow">I think Go Ho's idea is much better.</font>

166
00:13:58,816 --> 00:14:02,104
<font color="yellow">Let's think about it and meet again.</font>

167
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:23,175
<font color="yellow">Senior Ho.</font>

168
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:24,224
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

169
00:14:25,762 --> 00:14:27,674
<font color="yellow">Oh. I'm sorry.</font>

170
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:30,804
<font color="yellow">Go away!</font>

171
00:14:32,184 --> 00:14:35,352
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that our teams
have walls up to prevent leaks?</font>

172
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:37,709
<font color="yellow">Get going.</font>

173
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,888
<font color="yellow">Senior, it's just company business.</font>

174
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:42,232
<font color="yellow">Why bother working so hard?</font>

175
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:44,400
<font color="yellow">You're going to get paid the same,
no matter what happens.</font>

176
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,563
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

177
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:53,325
<font color="yellow">Don't you think that
you're being too hard on me?</font>

178
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,054
<font color="yellow">We even had kimchi stew together.</font>

179
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:00,285
<font color="yellow">Do you like me?</font>

180
00:15:00,285 --> 00:15:01,374
<font color="yellow">You already know that.</font>

181
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:02,843
<font color="yellow">I don't like you.</font>

182
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:05,749
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- I don't know.</font>

183
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:08,783
<font color="yellow">I don't like you. You're just my junior.</font>

184
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:14,185
<font color="yellow">I know you're cute, you're handsome.
I know you're really friendly too.</font>

185
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:20,477
<font color="yellow">You don't excite me. So stop.</font>

186
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:30,507
<font color="yellow">I'll make you get excited.</font>

187
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:34,022
<font color="yellow">Sleep with me.</font>

188
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,161
<font color="yellow">What did you just say to me?</font>

189
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:39,089
<font color="yellow">I want to sleep with you, Senior.</font>

190
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:42,001
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep because
I keep thinking about it.</font>

191
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:43,810
<font color="yellow">I'm quite good at it.</font>

192
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,609
<font color="yellow">You won't ever regret it.</font>

193
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:48,176
<font color="yellow">You will feel excited.</font>

194
00:15:50,377 --> 00:15:52,007
<font color="yellow">You'll end up liking me too.</font>

195
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:58,246
<font color="yellow">Let's keep it simple. Okay?</font>

196
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:13,766
<font color="yellow">We can't have information leaks,
don't you know that?</font>

197
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:15,993
<font color="yellow">I told you not to let your guard down.</font>

198
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:27,007
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

199
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:39,905
<font color="yellow">What are all of you doing?</font>

200
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:41,229
<font color="yellow">I'm glad I ran into you, Go Ho.</font>

201
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:43,295
<font color="yellow">Let's go to Yongin tomorrow
to see Madam Joo.</font>

202
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:46,203
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.</font>

203
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,276
<font color="yellow">We're in the middle of a competition.</font>

204
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:50,706
<font color="yellow">I'd rather not lose a team member.</font>

205
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:52,946
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'll be working off-site tomorrow.</font>

206
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,286
<font color="yellow">That works out, then.</font>

207
00:16:54,286 --> 00:16:57,392
<font color="yellow">I approved it without
thinking about the competition.</font>

208
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:01,545
<font color="yellow">Now, we can each
lose a person and it will be fair.</font>
