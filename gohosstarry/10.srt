<font color="yellow">Manager Hwang, we think
it's better to just lay it all out here.</font>

<font color="yellow">Senior Go Ho hasn't been
on this team for that long.</font>

150
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,816
<font color="yellow">I know that you have
close friends on that team.</font>

151
00:15:22,816 --> 00:15:27,006
<font color="yellow">Still, this isn't something
we can just not worry about!</font>

152
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:30,651
<font color="yellow">That's why we need
to see what their plan is!</font>

153
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:35,857
<font color="yellow">If ours isn't working, we'll have
to stay up all night fixing it!</font>

154
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:38,287
<font color="yellow">We need to see what
that team is working on.</font>

155
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:41,036
<font color="yellow">- I feel bad, but I agree.
- Me too.</font>

156
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:43,107
<font color="yellow">I will give it a try.</font>

157
00:15:43,107 --> 00:15:44,628
<font color="yellow">- You?
- Oh Jung Min?</font>

158
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:45,746
<font color="yellow">Jung Min?</font>

159
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:47,450
<font color="yellow">I'll approach Senior Ho.</font>

160
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,550
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

161
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:56,660
<font color="yellow">I understand how all of you feel.</font>

162
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,967
<font color="yellow">I can be held accountable,
as Team Manager.</font>

163
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,576
<font color="yellow">We just need to do our best.</font>

164
00:16:02,576 --> 00:16:05,666
<font color="yellow">If anything happens,
I will take responsibility.</font>

165
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:08,854
<font color="yellow">That's how I feel about it,
as the manager.</font>

166
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:13,523
<font color="yellow">Manager Hwang!</font>

167
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:17,893
<font color="yellow">Is he really being like this?</font>

168
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:21,166
<font color="yellow">He's new here. Losing won't
be great for him either.</font>

169
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:25,455
<font color="yellow">He's saying to do it.</font>

170
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:27,214
<font color="yellow">He's saying to do it.</font>

171
00:16:27,214 --> 00:16:30,555
<font color="yellow">How can a manager tell us to go
steal another team's project plan?</font>

172
00:16:30,555 --> 00:16:31,828
<font color="yellow">He's just saying that.</font>

173
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:35,012
<font color="yellow">No, no... not you.</font>

idea notebook if you have the chance.</font>
