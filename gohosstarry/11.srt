<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

150
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,885
<font color="yellow">- Cheers!
- Great.</font>

151
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:33,005
<font color="yellow">It's right not to tell them.</font>

152
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:34,516
<font color="yellow">We're competing with them.</font>

153
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:37,085
<font color="yellow">No, we should have told them.</font>

154
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:39,697
<font color="yellow">Keeping information to ourselves
shouldn't be how this works.</font>

155
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:41,475
<font color="yellow">Information is part of the planning.</font>

156
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:44,740
<font color="yellow">The model came to tell you because
of all the work you had put in before.</font>

157
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,872
<font color="yellow"><i>At that moment, I saw my heart.</i></font>

158
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:54,007
<font color="yellow"><i>If it were a different person</i></font>

159
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:58,200
<font color="yellow"><i>I wouldn't have felt any guilt
over keeping my mouth shut.</i></font>

160
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,267
<font color="yellow"><i>However...</i></font>

161
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:06,024
<font color="yellow"><i>Is this how I taught you?</i></font>

162
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:07,773
<font color="yellow">Stop focusing on the data.</font>

163
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:11,574
<font color="yellow">How many hit ads lately
have used data analysis?</font>

164
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,284
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't need
Song Dae Gi's number, then.</font>

165
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:15,322
<font color="yellow">- No!
- I see.</font>

166
00:13:15,322 --> 00:13:16,479
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

167
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:19,449
<font color="yellow">What kind of a company
makes storyboards like this?</font>

168
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:22,946
<font color="yellow">Do it again.</font>

169
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:26,904
<font color="yellow">Go in.</font>

170
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:28,850
<font color="yellow">Don't cry while you sleep.</font>

171
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,598
<font color="yellow">And don't be a pain in the ass tomorrow.</font>

172
00:13:31,598 --> 00:13:33,464
<font color="yellow">Come to work looking normal.</font>

173
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:38,196
<font color="yellow">It's working.</font>

174
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:43,615
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make people watch my
commercials and spend their money too.</font>

175
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,455
<font color="yellow">The hardest thing in the world
is moving someone's heart.</font>

176
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:48,949
<font color="yellow"><i>I had a past with Kang Tae Ho.</i></font>

177
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:51,939
<font color="yellow"><i>We were enemies during that time,
but we were on the same team.</i></font>

178
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:57,893
<font color="yellow">If Manager Kang Tae Ho were me,
he would tell you that you did well.</font>

179
00:13:57,893 --> 00:14:01,374
<font color="yellow">I know he was your boss,
but this is work.</font>

180
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,399
<font color="yellow">Put your feelings aside.</font>

181
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,394
<font color="yellow">You always say the right thing,
Manager Hwang.</font>

182
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:13,146
<font color="yellow">However, there existed a time when you
cared more about feelings than your work.</font>

183
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,450
<font color="yellow">There were times that you'd come to visit
your girlfriend in the middle of work.</font>

184
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,542
<font color="yellow">You would tell her that you missed her
and that you were just in the area.</font>

185
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,565
<font color="yellow">Back then...</font>

186
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:28,960
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that girlfriend was very happy.</font>

187
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,816
<font color="yellow">You're not one to do that usually,
but you made time, and during work hours.</font>

188
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:39,652
<font color="yellow">It may seem childish.</font>

189
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:44,120
<font color="yellow">She liked it because you seemed like you
cared more about her than your work.</font>

190
00:16:11,392 --> 00:16:13,986
<font color="yellow"><i>It's okay if I'm not your first.</i></font>

191
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:15,989
<font color="yellow"><i>To me, you are my first.</i></font>

194
00:16:43,123 --> 00:16:46,920
<font color="yellow"><i>You keep acting like this,
so I end up obsessing.</i></font>

195
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,287
<font color="yellow"><i>You little fraud.</i></font>

196
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,042
<font color="yellow"><i>You're acting like a senior too.</i></font>

197
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,088

00:16:53,088 --> 00:16:56,178
<font color="yellow"><i>If you have something to say,
it's best you get straight to the point.</i></font>

199
00:16:56,178 --> 00:16:57,758
<font color="yellow"><i>It's immature to use the team to do it.</i></font>

200
00:16:57,758 --> 00:16:59,846
<font color="yellow"><i>You work here too?</i></font>

201

<font color="yellow"><i>I know that my Ho is already
dating a good man.</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>Isn't Section Chief Park just trying
to go on a date with you?</i></font>

203
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,817
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you getting jealous?</i></font>

204
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:10,658
<font color="yellow"><i>You're just too smart.</i></font>
